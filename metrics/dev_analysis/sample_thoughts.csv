Quartile,Token Count,Thought Process,Is Correct
0-110,77,"step 1: the premise mentions that the previous year was extremely hot, specifically stating that it might have reached a hundred degrees in february. step 2: the hypothesis is suggesting that the previous year was extremely warm and it was a hundred degrees in february, which is exactly what the premise is saying. step 3: based on the logical reasoning, the hypothesis can be inferred from the premise.",False
0-110,96,"step 1: in the premise, a skier is performing an action (jumping) in a location (near a mountain range). there is no mention of any vehicles or men in the premise. step 2: the hypothesis describes a completely different scenario involving a man driving a car. the skier's jumping and man's driving are unrelated events. step 3: based on the logical reasoning, there is no way to infer the hypothesis from the premise as they describe different situations.",True
111-132,122,"step 1: the premise states that mrs. vandemeyer was dead, implying an unknown time of death. 'some hours' means the time of death is not immediate but sometime within a range of hours. step 2: the hypothesis suggests a specific time, just after two o'clock, for mrs. vandemeyer's death. however, the premise does not provide information about the exact time of death, so it is not possible to infer the hypothesis from the given premise. step 3: based on the logical reasoning, lack of specific information, and potential contradictory facts, the hypothesis cannot be inferred from the premise.",False
111-132,132,"step 1: in the premise, dublin tourism at suffolk street is described as having all the information and arranging tours. this implies that suffolk street is a location where tourism-related activities take place. no information is provided about the current state or occupancy of the location.step 2: the hypothesis states that suffolk street is an empty place with no offices or businesses open there. this contradicts the information in the premise that tours and tourism-related activities take place at suffolk street.step 3: based on the given information, the hypothesis cannot be logically inferred from the premise, as it contradicts the information provided in the premise about suffolk street being a location for tourism activities.",True
133-162,136,"step 1: the premise is a question asked by 'mr. franklin' to an unnamed speaker. no specific relationship or logical connection can be directly identified between the speaker and 'mr. franklin' from the given information. the hypothesis is a statement of the speaker's unwillingness to engage with 'mr. franklin'.step 2: the hypothesis does not logically follow from the premise because the premise does not provide any information that would lead to the speaker's decision to not want to talk to 'mr. franklin'. the hypothesis introduces new information not present in the premise.step 3: based on the given information, there is no logical entailment between the premise and hypothesis.",True
133-162,141,"step 1: the premise describes a broad agreement by various entities within the civil justice community about the values, purposes, and objectives of the state planning initiative. it does not provide any information about the duration or legal binding nature of this agreement. step 2: the hypothesis asserts that this agreement will be legally binding for a specific period of seven years. this information is not explicitly stated or logically implied in the premise. step 3: based on the given information, it's not possible to logically infer the hypothesis from the premise. the hypothesis introduces a new fact not present in the premise, i.e., the legal binding duration for seven years. therefore, the hypothesis cannot be entailed by the premise.",False
163+,195,"step 1: the premise 'anse was down' indicates that anse is in a state of being on the ground or lying down. this could be due to various reasons such as falling, being pushed, or being knocked down. step 2: the hypothesis 'anse had been knocked down by a horse' suggests that anse was caused to fall to the ground by the impact of a horse. this explanation is plausible given the premise, as 'being knocked down' is a possible reason for 'being down'. step 3: based on the logical connection between the two statements and the plausibility of the hypothesis given the premise, the hypothesis can be inferred from the premise.step 4: it is also important to note that there is no contradictory information in the premise or hypothesis that would make the hypothesis unreasonable or false. for example, if the premise indicated that anse was standing or sitting, then the hypothesis would not be entailed.therefore, the hypothesis can be logically inferred from the premise.",True
163+,272,"step 1: in the premise, it is mentioned that the speaker often takes off on thursdays and some saturdays to be home before his partner leaves for work. this suggests a consistent pattern of the speaker's schedule. the additional information that it is cheaper for the speaker to do this and take his vacation also indicates a practical reason for this arrangement. step 2: the hypothesis states that the speaker can get home about 20 minutes before his partner leaves. this hypothesis seems to be related to the premise as it also involves the speaker's ability to be home before his partner's departure. step 3: to determine if the hypothesis can be logically inferred from the premise, we need to consider if this 20-minute window is a reasonable assumption based on the information provided. there is no clear indication in the premise about the exact time the speaker arrives home or his partner leaves, but the premise does establish a consistent pattern of the speaker's schedule. the hypothesis could potentially be true based on this pattern, but it is not entailed by the premise as the exact timing is not mentioned. therefore, we cannot definitively say that the hypothesis is either entailed or not by the premise. step 4: however, since the hypothesis is plausible and consistent with the information in the premise, it could potentially be true in the given context, but it's not an entailed conclusion.",False
