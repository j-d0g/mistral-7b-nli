0-112,88,"step 1: the premise is an apology statement for causing frustration. it does not contain any information related to the hypothesis. the premise and hypothesis are about different topics.step 2: since the hypothesis does not relate to the premise in any way, it cannot be logically inferred from it.step 3: based on the lack of connection between the premise and hypothesis, and the different topics they cover, the hypothesis is not entailed by the premise.",False
0-112,102,"step 1: in the premise, the odor is described as not unpleasant but carrying clods of soil. this implies a strong, earthy smell, which is different from the putrid, decaying smell associated with a dead body. step 2: the hypothesis 'it reeked like a dead body' contradicts the premise, as a dead body's odor is significantly different and stronger than the described odor. step 3: based on the provided information, the hypothesis cannot be logically inferred from the premise, as they describe different odors.",True
113-135,117,"step 1: in the premise, the word 'puzzlement' indicates a state of confusion or uncertainty for drew. this state can be caused by various factors, including being perplexed by a situation or unable to understand something. step 2: the hypothesis suggests that drew was confused, which directly aligns with the state described in the premise. therefore, the hypothesis is a specific instance of the more general state described in the premise. step 3: the hypothesis can be logically inferred from the premise, as the state of confusion described in the hypothesis is a reasonable explanation for the puzzlement stated in the premise.",True
113-135,122,"step 1: in the premise, it is stated that the beatrix potter gallery is housed in a building that was once the office of william heelis, who was potter's solicitor husband. this information indicates a relationship between beatrix potter and william heelis as they are married. the premise mentions no contradictory facts or logical inconsistencies.step 2: the hypothesis states that there was no relation between beatrix potter and william heelis. this statement directly contradicts the information given in the premise.step 3: based on the logical reasoning, the hypothesis cannot be inferred from the premise as it contradicts the established relationship between beatrix potter and william heelis.",False
136-166,141,"step 1: in the premise, the speaker expresses a concern that our actions will make our grandchildren 'spoiled, rich little brats.' however, he also acknowledges his own defense of these actions. this suggests an internal conflict or ambiguity in his perspective. step 2: the hypothesis negates the initial concern stated in the premise, suggesting that the speaker does not believe we need to worry about our grandchildren becoming spoiled. this is consistent with the information given in the premise, as the speaker's defense of our actions implies a lack of concern for the potential negative consequences. step 3: based on the information in the premise and the logical relationship between the premise and hypothesis, the hypothesis can be inferred from the premise.",False
136-166,142,"step 1: the premise states that marketing is a process and many people don't realize this, suggesting that marketing may be complex or not immediately understood. the statement does not mention the knowledge of the target. step 2: the hypothesis suggests that marketing can be difficult even if you know your target. while knowing your target might make some aspects of marketing easier, it doesn't necessarily mean that the entire process is straightforward. in fact, the premise implies that marketing can be complex even for those who understand it. step 3: based on the logical reasoning and lack of contradictory facts, the hypothesis can be inferred from the premise, as the complexity of marketing can still exist even with the knowledge of the target.",True
167+,182,"step 1: the premise describes the context of an organization's activities, stating that they are conducted within the conservative judaism movement and in cooperation with its affiliated organizations in north america and israel. this information indicates the specific religious and geographical context of the organization's activities. step 2: the hypothesis maintains the same statement about the organization's activities but introduces a new location, sihanoukville, instead of north america. since sihanoukville is not explicitly mentioned in the premise, the hypothesis does not contradict the premise. however, it does expand on the premise by adding a new location where the organization cooperates with affiliated organizations. step 3: based on the given information, the hypothesis is not logically entailed by the premise. the premise only specifies north america, while the hypothesis introduces a new location, sihanoukville. however, the hypothesis does not contradict the premise, and the logical principles of non-contradiction and excluded middle are not violated.",True
167+,278,"step 1: in the premise, we have information about a disease that affects a large number of dogs and also a similar condition that affects a large number of children. the exact numbers are given as 'thousands' for dogs and 'over three hundred thousand' for children. step 2: the hypothesis has the same core information as the premise, which is the disease affecting a large number of dogs. however, the hypothesis changes the number of children affected from 'over three hundred thousand' to 'over 2 hundred thousand'. step 3: to determine if the hypothesis can be inferred from the premise, we need to consider if the difference in the number of children affected is a reasonable and necessary change based on the information given in the premise. the difference of 100,000 children is significant, but it does not contradict or change the logical connection between the disease affecting dogs and children. both the premise and hypothesis state that the disease is common to both species. thus, the hypothesis can still be logically inferred from the premise, but with a slightly different factual detail. step 4: based on the logical reasoning and common sense, the hypothesis can be considered a specific instance of the premise, with a slightly different factual detail.step 5: in summary, the hypothesis can be inferred from the premise as it maintains the logical connection between the disease affecting dogs and children, even though the exact numbers are different.",False
