3012,"For one thing, it lets you participate in the ongoing conversation that is a nation's culture.",It doesn not let you participate in the conversation that is not part of a nation's culture.,0,0,True,"step 1: in the premise, the statement 'it lets you participate in the ongoing conversation that is a nation's culture' implies that engaging in a nation's culture allows for interaction and involvement in its discourse. the hypothesis, 'it does not let you participate in the conversation that is not part of a nation's culture,' suggests a restriction or limitation to the conversation that is part of a specific culture. step 2: the hypothesis contradicts the premise because if we accept the premise, it implies that participating in a nation's culture enables conversation, while the hypothesis asserts that it does not allow participation in conversations outside of that culture. step 3: based on the contradictory nature of the hypothesis and the premise, the hypothesis cannot be logically inferred from the premise."
3021,Ca'daan felt uncomfortable in the gambling parlor but the crowds left them alone.,Ca'daan loved going to the gambling parlor.,0,0,True,"step 1: in the premise, ca'daan feels uncomfortable in the gambling parlor, yet the crowds leave them alone. this suggests that ca'daan might be an outsider or unfamiliar with the environment, and the crowds' non-interference indicates respect for ca'daan's space or comfort level. this doesn't provide any direct evidence for or against the hypothesis.step 2: the hypothesis 'ca'daan loved going to the gambling parlor' contradicts the premise, as loving something typically involves positive feelings and enjoyment, whereas feeling uncomfortable implies negative feelings. therefore, the hypothesis cannot be logically inferred from the premise.step 3: based on the logical reasoning and the contradiction between the premise and hypothesis, the hypothesis is not entailed by the premise."
3081,and i find like the the places that i'm going to now um because whenever you find a place that's good other people have already already found the same kind of a place and so sometimes i have to go to this place in uh where i know i have to wait at least fifteen minutes sometimes a half hour,I have not found many places that other people like not there isn't a very long wait.,0,0,True,"step 1: in the premise, the speaker mentions that they often have to wait at least fifteen minutes or even up to a half hour at the places they go to, because these places are already popular and liked by other people. this implies that the speaker encounters a high demand for these places, which indicates that they are good or appealing to many people.step 2: the hypothesis suggests that the speaker has not found many places that other people like, and there is no very long wait. this contradicts the premise, as the premise states that the speaker often has to wait for a significant amount of time at popular places.step 3: based on the logical contradiction between the premise and hypothesis, the hypothesis cannot be logically inferred from the premise."
3153,Extremely limited exceptions to the authority are established in 31 U.S.C.,The authority had a vast range of exceptions.,0,0,True,"step 1: in the premise, it is stated that 'extremely limited exceptions' to the authority are established in 31 u.s.c. this means that the normal situation is that there are few exceptions to the authority. step 2: the hypothesis, 'the authority had a vast range of exceptions', contradicts the premise by suggesting a much broader scope of exceptions than what is stated in the premise. step 3: based on the logical analysis of the given information, the hypothesis cannot be inferred from the premise as it contradicts the premise."
3168,"The real war in Kosovo is featured inside, as it is in Newsweek . Time berates NATO for its self-congratulatory and ill-timed birthday celebrations.",NATO just wanted to honor their own accomplishments and set their sights to the future.,1,0,False,"step 1: in the premise, newsweek covers the real war in kosovo, while time criticizes nato for celebrating their birthday during the conflict. this implies that nato was holding celebrations despite the ongoing war. however, the premise does not provide any direct information about nato's motivations for celebrating.step 2: the hypothesis suggests that nato's primary motivation was to honor their accomplishments and look towards the future. this is possible but not directly supported by the premise. it's plausible that nato could have been trying to send a message of strength and determination in the face of adversity, or simply wanting to celebrate a milestone regardless of the external circumstances.step 3: without more context or information, it's not possible to definitively determine if the hypothesis is entailed by the premise. the premise does not provide enough evidence to support the hypothesis, nor does it contradict it. the hypothesis is not ruled out by the premise but it's not logically derived from it either.step 4: based on the available information, the hypothesis is not entailed by the premise."
3177,"However, the diversity of the population to which generalization is required is a limiting factor in case study applications.",Population diversity isn't a limiting factor where case studies are concerned.,0,0,True,"step 1: the premise suggests that the diversity of a population is a limiting factor when it comes to applying generalizations derived from case studies. this implies that the larger and more diverse the population, the more difficult it becomes to draw valid conclusions from individual cases. step 2: the hypothesis contradicts the premise by stating that population diversity does not limit the applicability of case studies. this is a significant difference because the premise implies that diversity is a challenge, while the hypothesis claims otherwise. step 3: based on the logical negation of the premise in the hypothesis, it is not logically entailed by the premise. in fact, the hypothesis contradicts the premise and therefore cannot be inferred from it."
3186,"The appeals court rapped the agency for its scare tactics, saying it must base its conclusions on solid facts and a realistic appraisal of the danger rather than on vague fears extrapolated beyond any foreseeable threat.",The court supported the agency and thought they way they dealt with things was friendly.,0,0,True,"step 1: in the premise, the appeals court is expressing disapproval of the agency's use of 'scare tactics' and demanding that they base their conclusions on solid facts and a realistic appraisal of the danger. this implies that the court is not satisfied with the agency's approach and is requesting a change in their behavior.step 2: the hypothesis, stating that the court 'supported the agency and thought they way they dealt with things was friendly,' contradicts the information in the premise. the court's actions and statements in the premise are not consistent with the hypothesis, as the court is expressing dissatisfaction with the agency and demanding changes in their behavior.step 3: based on the information provided in the premise, the hypothesis is not logically entailed and, in fact, contradicts the premise."
3189,Construction Management Approach,The approach to construction management is new.,1,0,False,"step 1: in the premise, no specific information is provided about the age or history of the 'construction management approach'. step 2: the hypothesis asserts that the approach is new, which means it has not existed before a certain point in time. step 3: based on the information given, it cannot be logically inferred that the hypothesis is entailed by the premise as the premise does not provide enough context to confirm or deny the hypothesis."
3203,"During football and basketball seasons, the University of Nevada, Las Vegas fields teams in both sports.",There is no college in Las Vegas.,0,0,True,"step 1: in the premise, it is stated that the university of nevada, las vegas (unlv) fields teams for football and basketball during their respective seasons. this implies that unlv is a college or university located in las vegas. step 2: the hypothesis contradicts the premise as it states that there is 'no college' in las vegas. however, we know from the premise that unlv exists and is a college in las vegas. step 3: based on the contradiction between the premise and hypothesis, and the factual information provided in the premise, the hypothesis is not logically entailed by the premise."
3214,"Thoroughly destroyed by war , it is economically devastated and ethnically divided.","United by its diversity, the country is recording record economic growth.",0,0,True,"step 1: the premise describes a country that has been economically devastated and ethnically divided due to war. this implies significant economic instability and social unrest. step 2: the hypothesis suggests that despite the ethnic divisions, the country is recording record economic growth. this is a contradiction to the premise's description of economic devastation. however, it's important to note that the premise doesn't rule out the possibility of economic growth or improvement in such a context. step 3: inferring the hypothesis from the premise would require assuming a significant shift or change in the country's situation since the war. this could be plausible if there are extenuating circumstances or policies that have led to the economic growth. however, without explicit information about these factors, the hypothesis cannot be logically inferred from the premise alone.step 4: it's possible that the hypothesis is an optimistic view of the situation based on hope or desire for improvement, rather than being a logical deduction from the premise. without further context or evidence, it's not possible to determine if this growth is an actual reality or a potential future outcome.in conclusion, based on the given information, the hypothesis cannot be logically inferred from the premise."
3234,This type of testing is often referred to as penetration testing.,This testing is called dormant testing.,0,0,True,"step 1. in the premise, 'this type of testing' refers to penetration testing. penetration testing is a security testing methodology where ethical hackers simulate real-world attacks to find vulnerabilities in a system. the term 'penetration testing' is commonly used and widely known.step 2. in contrast, 'dormant testing' is not a term that is logically related to or can be inferred from 'penetration testing.' dormant testing is a type of software testing where the software is tested under idle conditions, not under stress or load. this term is not interchangeable or synonymous with penetration testing.step 3. based on the logical analysis, the hypothesis 'this testing is called dormant testing' is not entailed by the premise 'this type of testing is often referred to as penetration testing.'"
3307,But there is a deeper  A simple story is not the same as a simplistic one.,All simple stories are very simplistic.,0,0,True,"step 1: a deeper story implies a complex narrative with multiple layers of meaning and themes. it is not the same as a simplistic story, which lacks depth and complexity. the premise does not state or imply that all simple stories are simplistic. step 2: the hypothesis 'all simple stories are very simplistic' is not a logical consequence of the premise 'a simple story is not the same as a simplistic one'. in fact, the hypothesis contradicts the premise, as it asserts that all simple stories share the undesirable trait of being simplistic. step 3: based on the logical analysis, the hypothesis cannot be inferred from the premise."
3353,"Output - A tabulation, calculation, or recording of activity or effort that can be expressed in a quantitative or qualitative manner.",Output is a manufacturing calculation that can be expressed as a number or description.,1,0,False,"step 1: in the premise, 'output' is defined as a tabulation, calculation, or recording of activity or effort. this definition does not limit output to only manufacturing calculations, but it includes all types of outputs. however, the hypothesis specifically states that output is a manufacturing calculation. step 2: based on the provided information, the hypothesis is not a logical entailment of the premise. the hypothesis is more specific than the premise, as it limits the scope of 'output' to manufacturing calculations. step 3: the hypothesis cannot be logically inferred from the premise, as the premise does not limit the scope of 'output' to manufacturing calculations."
3361,and in uh my mother has done business in Germany and it was very difficult for her going over there because they just don't have very many business women,My mom's never done any business in Germany.,0,0,True,"step 1: in the premise, it is stated that the mother has done business in germany and it was difficult for her due to a lack of business women there. step 2: in contrast, the hypothesis suggests that the mother has never done any business in germany. the hypothesis directly contradicts the information given in the premise. step 3: based on the logical negation of the premise, the hypothesis cannot be inferred from the premise."
3386,Yet he was sure Ser Perth was serious; there was no humor on the face of the prissy thin-mustached man before him.,Ser Perth was hiding his true nature.,1,0,False,"step 1: in the premise, ser perth's face is described as having no humor, indicating a serious expression. this does not necessarily mean that ser perth is actually serious or hiding his true nature. it could simply mean that he is presenting a serious demeanor. step 2: the hypothesis suggests that ser perth's serious expression is a disguise for his true nature. this is a possibility, as people can sometimes hide their true feelings or intentions. it doesn't contradict the premise, but it doesn't follow logically either. step 3: based on the given information, there is not enough evidence to determine if the hypothesis is entailed by the premise or not. the premise only describes ser perth's appearance and demeanor, while the hypothesis makes an assumption about his true nature. without more context or information, it is impossible to logically infer the hypothesis from the premise."
3404,uh i really i miss college i had a good time,College was horrible and I hated it. ,0,0,True,"step 1: in the premise, the speaker expresses a sense of nostalgia and enjoyment for their college days. this implies that they had positive experiences during that time. step 2: the hypothesis, on the other hand, indicates a negative assessment of college. a direct contradiction of the premise is present. step 3: based on the information provided, the hypothesis cannot be logically inferred from the premise, as the premise does not support or suggest that the speaker had horrible experiences in college."
3405,but i guess to make it more difficult for the person who's just so irate and upset and you know temporarily a little bit uh offset or off keel i don't know if that's a large percentage percentage of uh crime or not but i guess it would be some but i i think definitely like today they just introduced the what's called the Brady bill the seven day mandatory waiting period on getting any guns and i think that,The Brady bill said you could buy anything instantly.,0,0,True,"step 1: in the premise, the speaker mentions the brady bill and its introduction, which includes a seven-day mandatory waiting period for buying guns. step 2: in contrast, the hypothesis suggests that the brady bill allows for buying things instantly. these two statements contradict each other because the premise states a waiting period while the hypothesis suggests an absence of one. step 3: based on the logical inconsistency between the premise and hypothesis, the hypothesis is not entailed by the premise."
3434,Three coffins surrounding the king's mummy are on display at the museum the inner one is fashioned from pure gold and weighs 170 kg (374 lbs).,The king's mummy is surrounded by a single coffin made of steel.,0,0,True,"step 1. in the premise, we have three coffins surrounding the king's mummy, with the inner one being made of gold and weighing 170 kg. this information suggests that the king's mummy is being preserved in a series of coffins, with the most elaborate and heavy one being the innermost one. step 2. the hypothesis, however, proposes that there is only a single coffin made of steel surrounding the king's mummy. this contradicts the information given in the premise, as the premise states that there are three coffins, not just one. step 3. based on the logical inconsistency between the premise and hypothesis, the hypothesis cannot be inferred from the premise."
3457,"A person playing a drum with only their lower torso, hands, drumsticks, and drum showing in the foreground.",A person is playing a guitar.,0,0,True,"step 1. in the premise, we have a description of a person playing a drum, with their lower torso, hands, drumsticks, and drum visible. the context does not provide any additional information about the scene or the person. the hypothesis, on the other hand, suggests that a person is playing a guitar.step 2. the premise and hypothesis describe different actions being performed by the person: drumming versus playing a guitar. the actions are not the same, and the presence of a drum and drumsticks in the premise does not logically imply the presence or use of a guitar. moreover, the visual description of the person's lower torso does not suggest guitar playing, as the posture and required body parts for playing a guitar differ from playing a drum.step 3. based on the logical analysis of the given information, the hypothesis 'a person is playing a guitar' cannot be logically inferred from the premise 'a person playing a drum with only their lower torso, hands, drumsticks, and drum showing in the foreground'."
3519,A message from Greuze was waiting on my bedside table.,Greuze never sent a message at all.,0,0,True,"step 1: in the premise, it is stated that a message from greuze was found on the bedside table. this implies that greuze is the sender and that a message existed. step 2: the hypothesis suggests that no message was sent by greuze at all. this directly contradicts the premise, as it states the existence of a message from greuze. step 3: based on the contradiction between the premise and hypothesis, it cannot be logically inferred that the hypothesis is entailed by the premise. the hypothesis goes against the factual information provided in the premise."
3520,An even older Stone Age site was discovered on Lamma Island in 1996.,There is a Stone Age site on Maui.,0,0,True,"step 1: in the premise, it is stated that an even older stone age site was discovered on lamma island in 1996. this implies that there is at least one stone age site on lamma island. step 2: the hypothesis suggests that there is a stone age site on maui. this statement does not follow logically from the premise, as there is no connection between lamma island and maui mentioned in the premise or hypothesis. common sense reasoning does not provide sufficient evidence to infer the existence of a stone age site on maui based on the information provided in the premise. step 3: based on the logical analysis and lack of connection between the premise and hypothesis, the hypothesis cannot be inferred from the premise."
3521,Technology may soon provide some solutions.,Technology will only cause more problems.,0,0,True,"step 1: in the premise, 'technology may soon provide some solutions' implies the potential of technology to resolve issues or improve situations. this statement is neutral, neither indicating that technology will definitely provide solutions nor that it will not.step 2: the hypothesis, 'technology will only cause more problems', makes a negative statement about technology. however, it does not directly contradict the premise since the premise does not state that technology will only provide solutions, only that it may.step 3: to determine if the hypothesis can be logically inferred from the premise, we need to consider if there is any logical connection or implication. the premise does not entail that technology will only cause problems, as it leaves open the possibility that technology might also provide solutions. therefore, the hypothesis cannot be logically inferred from the premise.step 4: it is important to note that the lack of logical entailment does not necessarily mean that the hypothesis is incorrect. the hypothesis implies a negative assessment of technology, but it is based on a different perspective from the premise. both statements could be true, depending on the context and specific examples of technology being considered."
3522,Democracy  widespread police killings and beatings,It is democratic for the police to kill others.,1,0,False,"step 1: the premise describes a situation where democracy is widespread, but it also mentions police killings and beatings. the relationship between democracy and police violence is not inherently clear. common sense and logical principles tell us that a democratic system values the protection of individual rights and freedoms, and excessive police violence infringes upon those very rights. step 2: the hypothesis, stating that it is democratic for the police to kill others, directly contradicts the general principles of a democratic system. in a democracy, the use of lethal force by law enforcement should be limited to situations where it is necessary to protect life or public safety. the hypothesis suggests that it is democratic for the police to take life unnecessarily, which is a violation of individual rights and the principles of democracy. step 3: based on the logical reasoning and the contradiction between the hypothesis and the general principles of a democratic system, the hypothesis is not entailed by the premise."
3523,"Age, Health, and the Willingness to Pay for Mortality Risk  A Contingent","Age, Health, and the Willingness to Pay for Mortality Risk A Contingent are very important topics being talked about worldwide.",1,0,False,"step 1: both the premise and hypothesis are statements about important topics related to age, health, and the willingness to pay for mortality risk. these topics are broad and can be discussed in various contexts, such as insurance, healthcare, or societal issues. there is no inherent contradiction between the two statements as they cover the same general topics.step 2: the hypothesis does not directly follow or logically entail the premise. the premise as a standalone statement does not imply that there is a contingent (a condition or circumstance) attached to the importance of age, health, and the willingness to pay for mortality risk. the hypothesis, on the other hand, specifically mentions the term 'contingent'. however, the premise does not provide any information about whether the importance of these topics is contingent or not.step 3: based on the logical analysis, the hypothesis is not logically entailed by the premise. the hypothesis adds a specific term to the general topics mentioned in the premise, but it does not follow logically from the information provided in the premise."
3524,During the 20th century Edinburgh became a European center of learning and culture.,Edinburgh gained it's peak popularity in the 1920s. ,1,1,True,"step 1: the premise states that edinburgh became a european center of learning and culture during the 20th century. this implies a significant increase in intellectual and artistic activities within the city. step 2: the hypothesis suggests that edinburgh reached its peak popularity in the 1920s. the terms 'peak popularity' imply that edinburgh was particularly well-known and influential during this time. step 3: although the premise does not explicitly state that edinburgh's popularity reached its peak during the 1920s, it is not necessarily contradictory to the premise. the increase in learning and culture during the 20th century could have included a period of exceptional popularity during the 1920s. step 4: there is historical evidence suggesting that edinburgh did indeed experience a cultural renaissance during the 1920s, which supports the hypothesis. for example, the edinburgh festival fringe was first held in 1947 but had its origins in an unofficial event called the '1920s festival' held in 1929. this event marked the beginning of the annual edinburgh festival, which is now renowned as the largest arts festival in the world. step 5: based on the logical reasoning, the availability of historical evidence, and the lack of contradiction, the hypothesis can be considered a reasonable inference from the premise."
3525,um-hum yep i think that's uh just just having a good time,I think it is about having a bad time.,0,0,True,"step 1: in the premise, there is no explicit information about the situation or context of 'having a good time'. it is a subjective statement, open to interpretation. the hypothesis, on the other hand, makes an opposite claim about 'having a bad time'. step 2: logically speaking, the premise does not provide enough information to infer the hypothesis. a person can have a good time in many situations, and it is not necessarily the case that having a good time implies having a bad time, or vice versa. step 3: based on the given information, the hypothesis cannot be logically inferred from the premise."
3526,"Mild - mannered in her convictions, Ms Li has also been a member of the Article 23 Concern Group and the Article 45 Concern Group.","Mild-mannered but forthright in her convictions, Ms Li has also been a member of the Article 23 Concern Group and the Article 45 Concern Group.",1,1,True,"step 1: in the premise, 'mild-mannered in her convictions' describes ms. li's personality trait related to her beliefs. 'has also been a member of the article 23 concern group and the article 45 concern group' states the groups she belongs to. both pieces of information are factually consistent and do not contradict each other. step 2: the hypothesis adds the descriptive term 'forthright' instead of 'mild-mannered' to describe ms. li's personality. however, 'mild-mannered' and 'forthright' are not contradictory; they can coexist. for example, someone can be mild-mannered in their tone but forthright in their words. step 3: since the hypothesis does not contradict the premise and the two descriptions (mild-mannered and forthright) are not mutually exclusive, the hypothesis can be logically inferred from the premise."
3527,anyway well you have a good day,Have a horrible day you terrible person,0,0,True,"step 1: the premise is a common farewell phrase, wishing someone a good day. it does not provide any specific information about the subject or their actions. the hypothesis, on the other hand, expresses the opposite sentiment, wishing a horrible day. step 2: the hypothesis cannot be logically inferred from the premise because the premise does not provide any information that would justify the hypothesis. in fact, the premise suggests a polite and friendly interaction. step 3: based on the lack of logical connection and the contradictory nature of the hypothesis, it cannot be inferred from the premise."
3528,A woman hanging the laundry outside.,A woman is in the kitchen cooking dinner.,0,0,True,"step 1: in the premise, a woman is performing the action of hanging laundry outside. this involves her going outside, possibly carrying a basket or clothesline, and securing clothes to a line. there are no contradictory facts or logical connections that suggest she is not in the kitchen at the same time. however, there is no clear indication that she is not in the kitchen as well.step 2: the hypothesis, 'a woman is in the kitchen cooking dinner,' is not logically inferred from the premise. while it's possible for a woman to be doing both tasks, the premise does not provide enough information to infer this. the actions described in the premise and hypothesis are not mutually exclusive, but they do not logically follow from one another.step 3: based on the given information, the hypothesis is not entailed by the premise."
3529,"In its Notice of Proposed Rulemaking, the Commission specifically stated that the proposed regulation would affect a number of entities both large and small.","In its notice, the commission stated that the regulation affected nobody at all.",0,0,True,"step 1: in the premise, the commission acknowledged that the proposed regulation would impact entities of various sizes. the statement 'affect a number of entities both large and small' is a clear indication of this. step 2: in contrast, the hypothesis suggests that the regulation had no impact on anyone at all, which is the opposite of the premise's statement. step 3: based on the logical inconsistency between the premise and hypothesis, it is clear that the hypothesis cannot be logically inferred from the premise.step 4: it is important to note that the absence of evidence in a premise does not imply the truth of a hypothesis that contradicts it. in this case, the premise does not mention the absence of small or large entities that were unaffected by the regulation, but it does state that the regulation affected 'a number' of entities. the hypothesis, on the other hand, asserts that the regulation affected nobody at all, which is a logical contradiction to the premise.therefore, the hypothesis is not entailed by the premise."
3530,"The Palais-Royal, across the rue de Rivoli from the Louvre, was built as Cardinal Richelieu's residence in 1639 (it became royal when Anne of Austria moved in with young Louis XIV).",The Palais-Royal was the home of many cardinals.  ,1,1,True,"step 1: in the premise, we learn that the palais-royal was initially built as cardinal richelieu's residence in 1639. this establishes a connection between the palais-royal and cardinals. step 2: the hypothesis suggests that 'many' cardinals lived at the palais-royal. while the premise only mentions cardinal richelieu, it does not contradict the hypothesis. in fact, there is historical evidence showing that the palais-royal was indeed a residence for various cardinals throughout history. step 3: given the premise and the historical context, it is a reasonable inference that 'many' cardinals lived at the palais-royal at different times. the hypothesis can be logically inferred from the premise with the additional historical context."
3531,we had one in Virginia that was sentenced to death and the execution was to have taken place a few weeks ago i don't know if there was anything in your paper about it,There is no death penalty in Virginia.,0,0,True,"step 1: in the premise, there is mention of a death sentence in virginia that was supposed to be carried out recently. this information contradicts the hypothesis that there is no death penalty in virginia. step 2: the hypothesis cannot be logically inferred from the premise because the premise provides evidence to the contrary. step 3: based on the logical reasoning and the factual inconsistency between the premise and hypothesis, the hypothesis is not entailed by the premise."
3532,'I really don't feel comfortable around people who enjoy making speeches.',I love being around people who enjoy public speaking.,0,0,True,"step 1: the premise expresses a personal discomfort or unease towards people who enjoy making speeches. it does not provide any information about the reason for this feeling or any actions or consequences related to it. step 2: the hypothesis states a direct opposite feeling, expressing a love for being around people who enjoy public speaking. there is no logical connection or implication of the hypothesis from the premise. common sense suggests that these two statements cannot be inferred from one another, as they describe opposing emotions. step 3: based on the logical analysis and the lack of connection between the premise and hypothesis, the hypothesis cannot be inferred from the premise."
3533,A colorfully dressed young man with visible skin lesions is sitting and smoking a cigarette.,a man is sleeping,0,0,True,"step 1: in the premise, we have a description of a young man who is colorfully dressed and has visible skin lesions. he is also sitting and smoking a cigarette. this information does not directly imply any actions related to sleeping or waking up. step 2: the hypothesis states that a 'man' is sleeping. the premise describes a 'young man', which is a subset of 'man'. however, the premise does not provide any evidence that the man described is sleeping. step 3: based on the given information, the hypothesis cannot be logically inferred from the premise as there is no evidence or logical connection between the two statements."
3534,to to that you know to your job if it's voluntary i mean if you don't like it i mean if you're like in other places where they have a you know mandatory you know uh services yeah,It is always mandatory at my employer.,0,0,True,"step 1. the premise discusses a situation where someone is asked about whether their job is voluntary or mandatory. the speaker mentions that they know if it's voluntary based on their own experience and feelings towards the job. step 2. the hypothesis states that it is always mandatory at 'my employer'. this is a direct contradiction to the premise, as the premise implies that the situation pertains to a job where the employment status (voluntary or mandatory) can vary. step 3. based on the logical negation of the premise's implications, the hypothesis cannot be inferred from the premise as it contradicts the premise's potential states."
3535,yeah what line of work are you in now since you went to school and,What's your mother's maiden name?,0,0,True,"step 1. in the premise, the speaker asks about the person's current profession. there is no mention of their family background or personal details like their mother's maiden name.step 2. the hypothesis, on the other hand, asks for a specific piece of personal information about the speaker's family history. the hypothesis cannot be logically inferred from the premise, as the premise provides no information related to family background or personal details.step 3. based on the logical analysis, the hypothesis is not entailed by the premise."
3536,There are few grains of truth in this story.,The story was embellished to encourage visitors.,1,0,False,"step 1: in the premise, 'few grains of truth' implies that there are significant inaccuracies or falsehoods in the story. this doesn't necessarily mean that every detail is fabricated but rather that some parts of the story may not be factually correct. step 2: in the hypothesis, 'encourage visitors' suggests an intention to add appealing elements to the story to make it more attractive or interesting. this could involve adding details, embellishments, or exaggerations. step 3: given the information from steps 1 and 2, it's possible that the embellishments mentioned in the hypothesis contributed to the lack of truthfulness in the story as described in the premise. however, the premise doesn't explicitly state that all the additions to the story were false, only that there are 'few grains of truth.' therefore, it's also possible that some embellishments were truthful or factually accurate. to determine if the hypothesis is a logical entailment of the premise, we would need more information about the specific embellishments added to the story and their factual accuracy.step 4: given the current information, it's not clear that the hypothesis can be logically inferred from the premise as there could be instances where a story is embellished but still contains some truth.step 5: based on the current information, it appears that the hypothesis is not a logical entailment of the premise."
3537,Several Asian women dressed in black outfits and crowns are holding plates with food on them.,women carry food on plates,1,1,True,"step 1: in the premise, several asian women are holding plates with food on them. this implies that the women are carrying the food on the plates. carrying food on plates is a common practice for serving and transporting food. no logical or factual inconsistencies are present in the premise or hypothesis.step 2: the hypothesis 'women carry food on plates' can be logically inferred from the premise as it is an explicit statement described within the premise. the hypothesis is a specific instance of the action described in the premise.step 3: based on the logical connections, common sense understanding, and factual consistency between the premise and hypothesis, the hypothesis is entailed by the premise."
3538,yeah it it talked about all SMU and their the death penalty and how they're getting around all the regulations and rules and and things of that nature i guess anymore it's just a big business,"It seems that companies no longer need to follow any rules and regulations, or so they think.",1,1,True,"step 1: in the premise, there is a discussion about smu (presumably southern methodist university) and the death penalty, with a focus on how they are circumventing regulations and rules. this implies that there are regulations and rules in place that smu is trying to avoid. step 2: the hypothesis suggests that 'companies' in general no longer need to follow rules and regulations. while smu is mentioned in the premise, it does not restrict the discussion to only them. the premise implies a context where rules and regulations exist and are being circumvented, which is consistent with the hypothesis. step 3: based on the context established in the premise, the hypothesis is a reasonable inference. it is a common observation that some companies may try to operate outside the bounds of regulations and rules, especially when they perceive an advantage in doing so. the hypothesis can be seen as a logical extension of the premise's context. step 3: the hypothesis 'it seems that companies no longer need to follow any rules and regulations, or so they think' can be inferred from the premise."
3539,The man drew his knife from the folds of his pants and went to a plate of polished silver A'deem tied to one side of the wood hut.,The man scratched his initial into the silver plate with his knife.,1,1,True,"step 1: in the premise, the man draws a knife from his pants and goes to a silver plate, which is tied to a wood hut. this implies that the man intends to make a mark on the silver plate. step 2: the hypothesis suggests that the man scratched an initial into the silver plate using his knife. this action is a logical consequence of the man's intention to mark the silver plate mentioned in the premise. step 3: in common-sense reasoning, it is a reasonable assumption that if someone intends to mark an object, they would likely use a tool such as a knife to do so. furthermore, the fact that the man goes directly to the silver plate after drawing his knife further supports this inference. therefore, the hypothesis is a logical entailment of the premise."
3540,"In both Britain and America, the term covers nearly everybody.",In both Britain and America the term covers almost everyone except for Israelites.,1,0,False,"step 1: in the premise, the term is used to cover nearly everybody in both britain and america. it does not specify what the term is, but the context suggests it is a broad term, possibly a nationality or ethnicity. common sense and factual knowledge do not provide any contradictory information, as there is no mention of israelites being excluded from the term in the premise.step 2: the hypothesis states that the term covers almost everyone except for israelites in both britain and america. this is a contradiction to the premise, as the premise states that the term covers nearly everybody, without any exceptions mentioned.step 3: based on the logical reasoning, the hypothesis cannot be inferred from the premise as it contradicts the information provided in the premise."
3541,"Marion Kozak or Marion Kozak Miliband (born 1934 as Dobra Jenta Kozak, also known as Maria Kozak) is a Polish-born British activist.","Marion Kozak or Miss Moneypenny Miliband (born 1934 as Dobra Jenta Kozak, also known as Maria Kozak) is a Polish-born British activist.",1,1,True,"step 1: both the premise and hypothesis agree that marion kozak was born in poland and is a british activist. there is no contradiction between the two statements.step 2: the hypothesis does not provide any new information that is not already present in the premise. both sentences state the same fact about marion kozak.step 3: since the hypothesis does not add any new information or contradict the premise, it is entailed by the premise."
3542,"(To compare Reich's new version with the original, click .) But this time he gets the Washington story basically  The point of most Washington hearings--for all concerned, including Cabinet secretaries--is not to listen and learn but to talk and score points.",Most Washington hearings make a point of listening and learning.,0,0,True,"step 1: the premise describes the general atmosphere and purpose of washington hearings, stating that they are more about talking and scoring points than listening and learning. this is based on the author's observation and experience. step 2: the hypothesis suggests an opposite scenario, where the primary goal of washington hearings is to listen and learn. step 3: the hypothesis contradicts the information provided in the premise. therefore, it cannot be logically inferred from the premise, based on the given information."
3543,But he knew that this was no delirium.,"He knew that he wasn't delirious, but he wasn't sure he was sane either.",1,0,False,"step 1: in the premise, 'he knew that this was no delirium' implies that the person is conscious and aware of his surroundings, and he is rejecting the notion that his experiences or thoughts are the result of delirium. the hypothesis introduces a new element, 'he wasn't sure he was sane,' which suggests uncertainty about his mental state. this uncertainty does not contradict the premise, as a person can be aware they are not delirious but still have doubts about their sanity. step 2: the hypothesis does not logically follow from the premise, as knowing one is not delirious does not automatically imply knowing one is sane. the hypothesis introduces a new piece of information that is not directly related to the premise. step 3: based on the logical analysis, the hypothesis is not entailed by the premise."
3544,"Kaufman did read from Gatsby in his act, according to Zehme's book, but rarely did he finish the first chapter anywhere, much less two pages.",They wanted to read more that night.,1,0,False,"step 1: in the premise, it is stated that kaufman started reading from gatsby but seldom finished more than the first chapter. this implies that kaufman had the intention to read more, possibly that night, but for some reason, he didn't.step 2: the hypothesis, 'they wanted to read more that night,' suggests that there were other people involved in this reading scenario besides kaufman. however, the premise does not mention any other individuals being present or involved in the reading.step 3: based on the information given, the hypothesis cannot be logically inferred from the premise, as there is no mention of 'they' or anyone else in the premise. the premise only refers to kaufman and his reading habits. thus, the hypothesis is not entailed by the premise."
3545,"Sideways"" won the Golden Globe Award for Best Motion Picture – Musical or Comedy and the Satellite Award for Best Film – Musical or Comedy. ""","Sideways "" won the Golden Globe Award for Best Motion Picture – Musical and the Satellite Award for Best Film – Musical or Comedy. """,1,1,True,"step 1: in the premise, it is stated that 'sideways' won two specific awards: the golden globe award for best motion picture – musical or comedy and the satellite award for best film – musical or comedy. these awards are categorized as 'musical or comedy'.step 2: the hypothesis also states that 'sideways' won two specific awards: the golden globe award for best motion picture – musical and the satellite award for best film – musical or comedy. the only difference is the label for the golden globe award. the hypothesis is identical to the premise in every other aspect.step 3: since the hypothesis is identical to the premise except for a minor label change, it can be logically inferred from the premise. the difference in labels does not alter the factual information presented.step 4: based on the logical reasoning and the lack of any contradictory facts, the hypothesis is indeed entailed by the premise."
3546,and uh pick them up and carry them there and that kind of thing,"Pick the heavy bags of corn up and move them over there, stuff like that.",1,1,True,"step 1: in the premise, the key actions are 'pick them up' and 'carry them there'. these actions can be applied to various objects, including heavy bags of corn. the term 'stuff like that' in the premise suggests similar actions or objects.step 2: in the hypothesis, the key actions are 'pick up' and 'move over there'. these actions are identical to the ones in the premise, and the objects being moved (heavy bags of corn) are a type of 'stuff' mentioned in the premise.step 3: based on the logical equivalence of the actions and objects between the premise and hypothesis, and the lack of contradictory information, the hypothesis can be inferred from the premise."
3547,"Never did a piece of architecture more exactly express the personality of its builder than the Ceteau de Versailles ' extravagant, pompous, dazzling, formidable, glorious, and vain.",THe palace didn't reflect his personality at all.,0,0,True,"step 1: in the premise, the statement 'never did a piece of architecture more exactly express the personality of its builder' implies that the ceteau de versailles reflects the personality of its builder in an accurate and precise way. the descriptive words used, such as 'extravagant, pompous, dazzling, formidable, glorious, and vain,' suggest a sense of grandeur, power, and self-importance, which aligns with the common understanding of the personality traits of a person who would build such a palace. step 2: the hypothesis, 'the palace didn't reflect his personality at all,' contradicts the premise by stating that the palace does not reflect the builder's personality. this contradiction makes it clear that the hypothesis cannot be logically inferred from the premise. step 3: based on the logical reasoning, the hypothesis is not entailed by the premise."
3548,Goethals acquired a Cooper - Climax.,"Goethals acquired a Cooper-Climax and entered it in the Formula Two class of the 1958 German Grand Prix, but retired from the race.",1,0,False,"step 1: in the premise, 'goethals acquired a cooper-climax' implies that goethals became the owner of a cooper-climax racecar. no specific information is given about the usage or participation of this car in any race.step 2: the hypothesis, 'goethals acquired a cooper-climax and entered it in the formula two class of the 1958 german grand prix, but retired from the race' adds the information that goethals entered the cooper-climax in a race and retired from it. this information is not directly contradictory to the premise, but it extends the information provided by the premise.step 3: to determine if the hypothesis can be logically inferred from the premise, we need to consider if the hypothesis is a necessary or reasonable consequence of the premise. the premise itself does not entail that goethals entered the cooper-climax in any particular race or that he retired from it. thus, the hypothesis cannot be logically inferred from the premise alone.step 4: however, it's important to note that the absence of logical entailment does not mean the hypothesis is false. in this case, the hypothesis might still be factually correct, but it provides additional information that goes beyond what is stated in the premise."
3549,how far west have you been,How far north have you been?,0,0,True,"step 1: in the premise, the question refers to a western direction. the hypothesis, on the other hand, asks about a northern direction. there is no commonality between the two directions, and the premise does not provide any information about the northern direction. step 2: the hypothesis cannot be logically inferred from the premise as there is no relationship between the two. step 3: based on the given information, the hypothesis is not entailed by the premise, as they ask about different directions."
3550,"Yes, yes, that's the point. ","No, that isn't the reason.",0,0,True,"step 1: in the premise, there is no explicit statement or implication about reasons or causes for the affirmative response. the premise only states that the response is 'yes, yes, that's the point'. step 2: the hypothesis asserts a negative statement about the reasons for the response being 'yes'. however, there is no information in the premise that contradicts or is inconsistent with this hypothesis. step 3: since the hypothesis does not contradict or follow logically from the premise, it cannot be inferred from the premise.step 4: it is important to note that the absence of information in the premise does not allow for the derivation of the hypothesis. the hypothesis requires specific information about the reasons for the affirmative response that is not provided in the premise.therefore,"
3551,actually i listened to one time i remember it's this is back when rap even uh i would say about ten or fifteen years ago i,"About 15 years ago  I listened to Rap one time, I am not really that fond of it,",1,1,True,"step 1: both the premise and hypothesis refer to a specific time period about 15 years ago and involve the listener's interaction with rap music. the premise states that the listener 'remembers' this event, indicating that it is a factual statement.step 2: the hypothesis can be directly inferred from the premise since it is a more specific version of the information provided in the premise. the hypothesis summarizes the essential information from the premise and does not contradict it.step 3: based on the logical relationship between the premise and hypothesis, and the lack of contradictory information, the hypothesis can be considered entailed by the premise."
3552,"'Excuse me, sir.' I was stopped by two security guards.","Luckily, I was not stopped my security. ",0,0,True,"step 1: the premise describes a situation where you were stopped by two security guards. there is no explicit information given about why you were stopped or if it was the 'right' security. however, the premise does not provide any contradiction to the hypothesis. step 2: the hypothesis suggests a fortunate situation where you were not stopped by 'my' security. since the premise does not specify 'my' security was involved in stopping you, the hypothesis does not contradict the given information. step 3: the hypothesis cannot be logically inferred from the premise as the premise does not provide enough information to deduce the identity of the security guards or why they stopped you."
3553,"With the advent of the Mughals in 1526, Delhi alternated with Agra as the capital, and each ruler asserted his particular taste in architectural caprice.",Each subsequent ruler picked one of the cities based on what his advisers told him.,1,1,True,"step 1: in the premise, it is mentioned that with the advent of the mughals in 1526, delhi and agra alternated as the capital cities, and each ruler asserted his particular taste in architectural caprice. this implies that the choice of capital city between delhi and agra depended on each ruler's preference. step 2: the hypothesis suggests that each subsequent ruler picked one of the cities based on what his advisers told him. this hypothesis does not contradict the premise, as it is possible that the advisers influenced the rulers' decisions regarding the choice of capital city. step 3: the hypothesis can be reasonably inferred from the premise because the premise does not provide explicit information on why each ruler chose delhi or agra as the capital, leaving room for the possibility that advisers played a role in the decision-making process.step 4: the hypothesis does not contradict the known facts stated in the premise, and it offers a plausible explanation for the observed phenomenon, making it a valid inference.therefore, the hypothesis is a valid inference from the premise."
3554,"In its most marked deviation from real life, Man on the Moon provides Kaufman with a kind of feel-good comeback.",Man on the Moon has a happy ending. ,1,1,True,"step 1: in the premise, it is mentioned that man on the moon provides kaufman with a 'kind of feel-good comeback' in its most marked deviation from real life. this implies that the movie has an ending that is more positive or uplifting than the reality it is based on. the term 'feel-good comeback' is commonly used to describe a movie or story with a happy or satisfying conclusion.step 2: the hypothesis, 'man on the moon has a happy ending', directly aligns with the information provided in the premise. a happy ending is exactly the kind of 'feel-good comeback' mentioned in the premise.step 3: based on the logical connection between the premise and hypothesis, and the lack of contradictory information, the hypothesis can be inferred from the premise."
3555,I felt like I was betraying something.,"It felt fine, I had no qualms.",0,0,True,"step 1: the premise expresses a feeling or emotion of betrayal. this emotion often arises when there is a conflict between personal values or loyalties. it suggests a sense of guilt or disloyalty. step 2: the hypothesis contradicts the premise by stating that there were no feelings of guilt or qualms. contradictory hypotheses cannot be logically inferred from premises that express opposing statements. step 3: based on logical principles, the hypothesis 'it felt fine, i had no qualms' cannot be inferred from the premise 'i felt like i was betraying something'."
3556,and uh you know once you start up at the top and try to get those dollars on down to the hands that need them you know there's a lot of places the money stops and disappears along the way,All the money always gets into the hands of those who need it.,0,0,True,"step 1. in the premise, the speaker describes a scenario where money moves from a starting point towards those who need it, but acknowledges that some of the money gets 'lost' or 'disappears' along the way. this implies a lack of complete transfer of funds to those in need. the premise does not provide information about the reason or extent of the money disappearing.step 2. the hypothesis asserts that all the money always gets into the hands of those who need it, which is a direct contradiction to the premise. the hypothesis assumes a complete transfer of funds to those in need, whereas the premise acknowledges that some of the money is lost or disappears before reaching them.step 3. based on the logical contradiction between the premise and hypothesis, the hypothesis cannot be inferred from the premise."
3557,and went up there one day and the plant was nothing but a stem they devoured it that quickly,That is one of the plants that they are most likely to bother.,1,1,True,"step 1: in the premise, it is stated that 'they' (presumably some animals) came across a plant and consumed it so quickly that there was nothing left but a stem. this implies that the plants in question are edible and desirable to the animals.step 2: in the hypothesis, it is stated that 'that is one of the plants that they are most likely to bother'. given the information from the premise, it can be inferred that the plants the animals are most likely to bother are the edible ones, as they have shown a preference for them. the hypothesis is consistent with the premise.step 3: based on the logical relationship between the premise and hypothesis, and the common-sense understanding that animals are more likely to consume and disturb plants that they find edible and desirable, the hypothesis can be inferred from the premise."
3558,"I had a client come in off the street one day and she said, `I'm really afraid he's going to kill me this time, I need a protection from abuse order.",One of my clients is in an abusive relationship.,1,1,True,"step 1: in the premise, a client (identified as a woman) expresses her fear for her safety, stating that she believes her partner is a threat to her life. this fear indicates the presence of an abusive relationship. the woman's statement is consistent with common experiences and knowledge about abusive relationships. no contradictory information is provided in the premise.step 2: the hypothesis is directly related to the premise as it also refers to the presence of an abusive relationship. the woman's statement in the premise provides evidence for the hypothesis.step 3: based on the logical connection between the premise and hypothesis, the hypothesis is entailed by the premise."
3559,uh Tom Jones our environmental corporate environmental guy's handling the project,No one is handling that project.,0,0,True,"step 1: in the premise, tom jones is identified as the person handling the project. this indicates that there is an individual responsible for managing the project.step 2: the hypothesis suggests that no one is handling the project, which is the opposite of the premise. if the hypothesis is true, then tom jones cannot be handling the project as stated in the premise.step 3: based on the information provided, the hypothesis is not logically entailed by the premise because the premise and hypothesis are in direct contradiction.step 4: common sense suggests that if someone is handling a project, then it is not the case that no one is handling it. therefore, the hypothesis cannot be reasonably inferred from the premise."
3560,A key distinguishing factor in such individuals is that they are theoretical gurus of all trades but average or below average implementers of that knowledge.,A key distinguishing factor in such individuals is that they are theoretical gurus of some trades but average or below average implementers of that knowledge.,0,1,False,"step 1: in the premise, it is stated that a key distinguishing factor in certain individuals is that they are theoretical gurus of all trades but average or below average implementers of that knowledge. this means that these individuals have extensive knowledge and understanding of various fields, but they lack the practical skills to effectively apply this knowledge. step 2: the hypothesis suggests that a key distinguishing factor in certain individuals is that they are theoretical gurus of some trades but average or below average implementers of that knowledge. this is similar to the premise, as it also acknowledges the existence of individuals who have deep theoretical knowledge in some areas but lack practical skills. the hypothesis does not contradict the premise, as it is a more specific version of the premise. step 3: based on the similarity between the premise and hypothesis, and the lack of contradictory information, the hypothesis can be inferred from the premise.step 4: an alternative way to consider this is to think about how the hypothesis could be derived from the premise using logical reasoning. the premise states that individuals are theoretical gurus of all trades and average or below average implementers. this can be broken down into two separate statements: (1) individuals are theoretical gurus of some trades, and (2) individuals are average or below average implementers of that knowledge. the hypothesis combines these two statements, stating that individuals are theoretical gurus of some trades but average or below average implementers of that knowledge. this shows that the hypothesis can be logically derived from the premise.therefore, the hypothesis is logically entailed by the premise."
3562,"I'm so pleased that I was recognized for my efforts, I just can't take all of the credit.",I think it'd be appropriate to take all the credit.,0,0,True,"step 1: the premise indicates that the speaker is pleased about being recognized for their efforts, but they don't want to take all the credit. this implies that there were other contributors to the accomplishment. step 2: the hypothesis suggests that the speaker should take all the credit, which contradicts the information in the premise. taking all the credit is the opposite of acknowledging the contributions of others. step 3: based on the logical inconsistency between the premise and hypothesis, the hypothesis cannot be inferred from the premise."
3563,no neither are tapes i i i buy we buy cassette tapes and machines will eat them you did so you're best bet any day anymore these days is a compact disk those things are practically indestructible,Compact disks are more durable than cassette tapes because there are fewer moving parts.,1,1,True,"step 1: in the premise, the speaker mentions that cassette tapes and machines will eat them, implying that cassette tapes are less durable compared to compact disks. the speaker also states that compact disks are practically indestructible, indicating their durability. the speaker's statement that 'these days, any day' is best bet for compact disks further implies that they are currently preferred over cassette tapes due to their durability. step 2: the hypothesis 'compact disks are more durable than cassette tapes because there are fewer moving parts' is a valid statement based on common knowledge and technical facts. fewer moving parts generally mean less chance of wear, malfunction, or damage. step 3: the hypothesis can be logically inferred from the premise as it explains why compact disks are more durable than cassette tapes based on the fewer moving parts. the premise does not directly state the reason for the difference in durability between compact disks and cassette tapes, but the hypothesis provides a logical and reasonable explanation. step 4: therefore, the hypothesis is entailed by the premise."
3564,"Generalizability We often are asked questions where the customer wants in-depth information that is nationally generalizable, but frequently the issue may not yet be ripe for a national study or we do not have the resources to collect in-depth data from nationally representative samples.",There are always resources available to collect in-depth data from nationally representative samples.,0,0,True,"step 1: in the premise, the speaker acknowledges that there are situations where they cannot provide nationally generalizable information due to the lack of resources or the unripeness of the issue for a national study. this implies that there are indeed instances where resources are insufficient or unavailable for nationally representative data collection.step 2: the hypothesis contradicts the premise by stating that there are always resources available for such data collection. this is a logical contradiction since the premise states that there are instances where resources are not available.step 3: based on the logical analysis, the hypothesis is not entailed by the premise as it contradicts the stated facts."
3565,"At 12 months, outcomes for both groups were still not different, but the percentage of patients who had improved had decreased and was no longer significantly different from baseline.",Assessments were done for both groups' improvements on a monthly basis.,1,0,False,"step 1: in the premise, it is mentioned that assessments were done for both groups at 12 months, but no information is provided about the frequency of assessments before or after this point. the hypothesis states that assessments were done monthly. step 2: the premise does not entail nor contradict the hypothesis regarding the frequency of assessments. the hypothesis is silent about the 12-month point and focuses on the method of assessment. step 3: there is not enough information in the premise to infer the hypothesis, as it introduces new information about the frequency of assessments. thus, the hypothesis is not entailed by the premise."
3566,"This draft is being sent to financial management and audit officials at all levels of government, the public accounting profession, academia, professional organizations, and public interest groups.",The draft contains information that is of interest to many different groups of people.,1,1,True,"step 1: in the premise, various groups of people are identified as the intended recipients of the draft. these groups include financial management and audit officials at all levels of government, the public accounting profession, academia, professional organizations, and public interest groups. this indicates that the draft contains information that is relevant to a wide audience. step 2: the hypothesis, 'the draft contains information that is of interest to many different groups of people', is a logical consequence of the premise because the premise states that these diverse groups have been targeted to receive the draft. the hypothesis is a generalization of the information provided in the premise. step 3: based on the logical relationship between the premise and hypothesis, and the lack of contradictory information, the hypothesis can be inferred from the premise."
3567,Muzzled greyhounds are racing along a dog track.,The dogs are in a shelter after being used.,0,0,True,"step 1: in the premise, greyhounds are racing on a dog track with muzzles. muzzles are used to restrict a dog's ability to bite, often seen in situations where the dog might be aggressive or uncontrollable. however, the presence of muzzles alone does not provide enough context to infer definitively whether the dogs are in a racing environment or have been used for racing and then placed in a shelter.step 2: the hypothesis suggests that the dogs are in a shelter after being used. this statement contradicts the premise, as the dogs are currently racing and not at a shelter.step 3: based on the logical analysis and the contradictory nature of the hypothesis to the premise, the hypothesis is not logically entailed by the premise."
3569,"for nearly 60 years after his death, there seemed to be a conspiracy of silence over his fate.","He died aged 70 in 1924, but for nearly 60 years after his death, there seemed to be a conspiracy of silence over his fate.",1,0,False,"step 1: the premise describes a long-lasting silence concerning the fate of a deceased person. the length of this silence is nearly 60 years. step 2: the hypothesis also mentions the silence lasting for nearly 60 years after the person's death. additionally, it provides extra information about the person's age at death (70 in 1924). step 3: the hypothesis does not contradict the premise. it may, in fact, be a more specific or detailed version of the premise. however, the hypothesis being more specific does not automatically make it a logical entailment of the premise. in some cases, additional details can make a hypothesis less likely or impossible given the premise. step 4: to determine if the hypothesis is logically entailed by the premise, we need to consider if the hypothesis follows logically from the information in the premise. in this case, the hypothesis does not add anything new that can be logically deduced from the premise alone. the age at death and the length of the silence are both mentioned in the hypothesis but were not explicitly stated or implied in the premise. therefore, the hypothesis is not logically entailed by the premise. step 5: the hypothesis and premise share some similarities, but they are not identical. the hypothesis is a more detailed version of the premise, but it does not follow logically from the premise alone. step 6: given the information provided, the hypothesis is not logically entailed by the premise, and there is no entailment relationship between them."
3570,"8 After 2010, we assumed discretionary spending would grow at the same rate as GDP.",GDP and discretionary spending were expected to grow by 20 percent after 2010.,1,1,True,"step 1: in the premise, it is stated that after 2010, discretionary spending was assumed to grow at the same rate as gdp. this implies that the rate of growth for discretionary spending and gdp are equal. step 2: the hypothesis suggests that gdp and discretionary spending were both expected to grow by 20 percent after 2010. this aligns with the premise, as both gdp and discretionary spending growing at the same rate implies that they both have a specific growth rate. step 3: based on the logical connection between the premise and hypothesis, and the absence of contradictory information, the hypothesis can be inferred from the premise."
3571,yeah okay yeah those games are fun to watch you you you watch those games,Those games are a lot of fun so I watch all of them.,1,1,True,"step 1: in the premise, the speaker is expressing that they enjoy watching those games. step 2: the hypothesis states that the speaker watches all of those games due to their enjoyment. this inference can be made based on the information provided in the premise, as the enjoyment of the games is a clear reason for why someone would watch all of them. step 3: the hypothesis is logically entailed by the premise, as the premise implies the existence of enjoyment for the games, which directly leads to the conclusion that the speaker watches all of them."
3572,well i think the writers had the same problem,I think the writers were having problems with the printer as well. ,1,1,True,"step 1: in the premise, the expression 'the writers had the same problem' indicates that there is a shared issue or challenge between the writers. the hypothesis suggests a specific issue, 'problems with the printer'. step 2: the hypothesis 'i think the writers were having problems with the printer' can be considered a reasonable inference from the premise, given that having problems with a printer is a common challenge for writers. the hypothesis does not contradict the premise but rather specifies the nature of the problem. step 3: based on the logical connection between the premise and hypothesis, and the commonality of printer problems among writers, the hypothesis can be inferred from the premise."
3574,She was alone at last with the president!,"At last, she has been alone with the president! I envy her.",1,0,False,"step 1: in the premise, 'she was alone at last with the president' indicates that she spent some time alone with the president. the phrase 'at last' suggests that this was a significant or long-awaited event for her. the hypothesis 'at last, she has been alone with the president' conveys the same meaning with a slightly different emphasis. both sentences describe a situation where she was alone with the president.step 2: the hypothesis 'i envy her' does not logically follow from the premise. the premise only describes the situation, it does not provide any information about the speaker's emotions or thoughts. the hypothesis adds an extra statement that is not in the premise.step 3: based on the logical analysis, the hypothesis 'i envy her' is not entailed by the premise."
3575,The views from the summit of Arthur's Seat nobody is quite sure which Arthur gave his name to the hill offer wonderful views of the city and across the Firth of Forth to the north.,No one is sure if it was Arther I or Arthur II who named the hill.,1,1,True,"step 1. in the premise, it is stated that the origin of the name 'arthur's seat' is uncertain. this leaves room for the possibility that there could be more than one arthur who could have named the hill. the hypothesis suggests an alternative possibility, that it could have been arthur i or arthur ii. step 2. the hypothesis does not contradict the premise, as both suggest an uncertainty about which arthur named the hill. in fact, the hypothesis expands on the uncertainty stated in the premise. step 3. based on the logical consistency between the premise and hypothesis, and the lack of contradictory information, the hypothesis can be considered a valid inference from the premise."
3576,"The village of La Roque-Gageac, glued to an overhanging cliff, is known as one of the most beautiful (and most visited) in the country ' especially well-deserved when the late-afternoon sun catches the houses' stone-tiled roofs.",La Roque-Gageac ranks last in tourism of any city in the nation.,0,0,True,"step 1: the premise describes la roque-gageac as a beautiful and well-visited village, appreciated more during late afternoon when the sun catches its stone-tiled roofs. this information implies that la roque-gageac is popular among tourists. step 2: the hypothesis states that la roque-gageac ranks last in tourism of any city in the nation. this is a direct contradiction to the information in the premise that implies la roque-gageac is well-visited and beautiful, which is a desirable trait for tourist destinations. step 3: based on the logical reasoning, common sense, and factual inconsistency with the premise, the hypothesis is not entailed by the premise."
3577,do you have to buy metal copper is a very good one to collect even aluminum yeah so,"Copper as a metal is almost worthless, so you shouldn't collect it.",0,0,True,"step 1: the premise discusses the speaker's personal opinion that buying copper is a good thing for collecting, even if aluminum is also involved. it does not provide any factual information or logical connections to the hypothesis. step 2: the hypothesis states that copper as a metal is worthless and therefore should not be collected. this directly contradicts the premise, as the premise suggests that copper has value. step 3: based on the logical reasoning, common sense, and the contradictory nature of the hypothesis to the premise, the hypothesis is not entailed by the premise."
3579,yeah it's hard to get a job you know,I can't walk down the street without being offered a job.,0,0,True,"step 1: in the premise, it is stated that getting a job is hard. this implies that there is a significant number of job seekers for each available position. in contrast, the hypothesis states that the speaker cannot walk down the street without being offered a job. this is a much stronger claim and suggests a surplus of job opportunities or an unusually high demand for the speaker's skills.step 2: the hypothesis contradicts the premise because it assumes that job offers are abundant, which is not indicated in the premise. if getting a job is hard, as stated in the premise, then it is unlikely that the speaker would be offered a job every time they go down the street.step 3: based on the logical analysis, the hypothesis cannot be inferred from the premise as it contradicts the information provided."
3580,Michael Huffington in California in 1994,Huffington in Texas in 1997.,0,0,True,"step 1. in the premise, we have specific information about michael huffington being in california in 1994. the hypothesis states that michael huffington was in texas in 1997. step 2. the hypothesis contradicts the premise as the locations and years do not match. there is no logical or factual connection between being in california in 1994 and being in texas in 1997. step 3. the hypothesis cannot be logically inferred from the premise as they describe different places and times."
3581,"USE OF STATE PLANNING to integrate, coordinate, and increase resources available in every state and territory.",State planning leads to decreased resources available.,0,0,True,"step 1: analyzing the premise, it states that state planning is used to integrate, coordinate, and increase resources available in every state and territory. this implies that resources are being pooled together and managed collectively.step 2: the hypothesis suggests that state planning leads to decreased resources. this contradicts the premise, as the premise states that state planning results in increased resources. the hypothesis can't be logically inferred from the premise and may be factually incorrect.step 3: based on the given information, the hypothesis is not entailed by the premise."
3582,Pony-tailed policewomen frantically gesticulate and whistle in a doomed effort to stir the immovable traffic; drivers at their wit's end lean on their horns in sympathy and add to the cacophony.,It is common for policewomen to wear ponytails in their hair.,1,1,True,"step 1: in the premise, it is stated that 'pony-tailed policewomen' are present. this indicates that it is a common sight to see policewomen with ponytails. step 2: the hypothesis 'it is common for policewomen to wear ponytails in their hair' is exactly what is stated in the premise. therefore, the hypothesis can be directly inferred from the premise. step 3: based on the straightforward match between the premise and hypothesis, the hypothesis is entailed by the premise."
3583,"Steele contributed to the band 's 2014 album "" "".","Steele contributed to the band's 2014 album """", but was later replaced full-time by Alessandro Venturella.",1,0,False,"step 1: in the premise, steele is stated to have contributed to the band's 2014 album. this contribution could be in various forms such as writing, recording, or producing. there are no explicit details about the nature or extent of steele's contribution or his relationship with the band after this album. step 2: the hypothesis suggests that steele was replaced full-time by alessandro venturella after contributing to the 2014 album. this implies that steele no longer remained a permanent member of the band after this contribution. step 3: while the premise itself does not entail the hypothesis directly, the two statements are consistent with each other. it is possible for a person to contribute to a project and then leave the project or be replaced later. common sense and logical principles do not dictate that a contribution must be accompanied by a lifelong commitment. therefore, the hypothesis cannot be logically inferred from the premise, but it is not contradictory either."
3584,"Funchal is the single town of any size on the island, indeed in the whole of the archipelago.",There are many towns of the same size of Funchal on the islands.,0,0,True,"step 1: in the premise, funchal is described as the 'single town of any size' on the island and in the whole archipelago. this suggests that funchal is the only significant urban area in the region. step 2: the hypothesis contradicts the premise as it claims that there are 'many towns of the same size' as funchal. logically, these statements cannot both be true. step 3: based on the given information and logical principles, the hypothesis is not entailed by the premise."
3585,What do you expect?,You're not expecting anything?,0,0,True,"step 1: in the premise, 'what do you expect?' is an open-ended question, often asking about anticipations or assumptions. it does not provide specific information about the speaker's expectations. in the hypothesis, 'you're not expecting anything?' is a statement suggesting a lack of expectation. step 2: the hypothesis can neither be logically inferred nor contradicted by the premise, since the premise does not provide sufficient information to determine if the speaker does or does not have an expectation. step 3: based on the given information, the hypothesis is not entailed by the premise and cannot be determined to be true or false."
3586,But I'd wager he's telling Beatty about how the disaffected voters who turned out to elect Ventura might be mobilized in a national campaign.,Voters did not turn out to elect Ventura.,0,0,True,"step 1: the premise describes a situation where someone (presumably the speaker) is making an assumption about why beatty is being informed about something related to ventura. the assumption is that the disaffected voters who turned out to elect ventra could be mobilized in a national campaign. this suggests that ventura was indeed elected with the support of a significant number of voters. step 2: the hypothesis states that the voters did not turn out to elect ventura, contradicting the information in the premise. step 3: based on the logical negation of the information in the premise, the hypothesis cannot be inferred from it as it directly contradicts the premise's key assumption.step 4: it's important to note that even if the hypothesis were grammatically correct (as in 'ventura was not elected by the voters'), it would still not be logically entailed by the premise since the premise implies, through the use of the word 'turned out', that the voters did in fact participate in ventura's election.therefore,"
3587,Severn dug trenches and holes near the support.,The trenches filled with water. ,1,0,False,"step 1: the premise describes an action where severn dug trenches and holes near the support. this does not provide any direct information about the current state of the trenches or whether they contain water or not. it's important to note that the presence of water in the trenches is not mentioned or implied by the premise.step 2: the hypothesis suggests that the trenches are filled with water. however, there is no logical connection between the premise and the hypothesis based on the given information. the premise does not provide any evidence that the trenches are filled with water, and the hypothesis cannot be directly inferred from the premise.step 3: based on the logical reasoning, the hypothesis cannot be inferred from the premise."
3588,It was produced by Goldfrapp and describes laboratory rats in neuroscience experiments.,It was produced by Brandon Camp and describes laboratory rats in neuroscience experiments.,0,0,True,"step 1. the premise specifies that the production of the item in question was done by goldfrapp. this information provides context about who created the described entity. the hypothesis similarly states that the production was done by brandon camp. step 2. the key difference between the premise and hypothesis lies in the author's names. however, the descriptions of the subject matter are identical in both sentences: laboratory rats in neuroscience experiments. step 3. the hypothesis does not follow logically from the premise because the author's name is not a determining factor for the described content. there is no logical connection or common-sense reasoning that would allow us to infer the hypothesis from the premise based on the given information. step 4. the hypothesis contradicts the premise to some extent, as it assigns a different author to the creation. however, the contradiction does not necessarily prevent the hypothesis from being true. in this case, the contradiction is significant enough to classify the hypothesis as not being logically entailed by the premise.step 5. in conclusion, the hypothesis is not logically entailed by the premise, as it introduces new information that contradicts the author's name stated in the premise."
3589,well good luck in your house hunting,Hope you enjoy the house you just got.,0,1,False,"step 1: in the premise, the speaker is wishing the person (presumably a friend or family member) good luck in their house hunting. house hunting is the process of looking for and purchasing a house. step 2: the hypothesis expresses the hope that the person will enjoy the house they have recently acquired or purchased. these sentences describe two related events in sequence: house hunting and enjoying the newly-purchased house. step 3: the hypothesis can be reasonably inferred from the premise because the successful completion of house hunting results in the acquisition of a house, which is the subject of enjoyment in the hypothesis."
3590,Each subclass must generate sufficient revenue to cover its costs.,"It is impossible to generate enough revenue, isn't it?",0,0,True,"step 1: in the premise, it is stated that each subclass must generate sufficient revenue to cover its costs. this implies a requirement or expectation that the revenue generated by each subclass should be equal to or greater than its costs. step 2: the hypothesis, 'it is impossible to generate enough revenue', contradicts the premise in that it suggests an absolute inability to meet the revenue requirement. however, the hypothesis does not provide any specific information about the reasons for this impossible scenario or whether it applies to all subclasses. step 3: without further context or information, it is not possible to logically infer the hypothesis from the premise. the premise only sets a condition (generate sufficient revenue) without stating that it is unattainable. therefore, the hypothesis is not entailed by the premise."
3591,"But many of the clients served by the Women's Haven outreach programs are the working poor, who don't qualify for free legal services.",Working poor mostly need free legal services to represent them in contract disputes.,1,1,True,"step 1: in the premise, it is mentioned that the women's haven outreach programs serve clients who are the working poor and do not qualify for free legal services. this implies that these clients have limited financial resources. step 2: the hypothesis suggests that working poor mostly need free legal services for contract disputes. although the premise does not directly provide information about the reasons why these clients cannot afford legal services, it is common sense and well-documented that the working poor are more likely to encounter contract disputes due to their financial situation. additionally, the need for legal representation in contract disputes can lead to significant financial consequences if not resolved, further exacerbating their financial hardships. step 3: based on the information provided, it can be inferred that the need for free legal services for contract disputes is a logical consequence of the clients' financial situation described in the premise. therefore, the hypothesis is a reasonable inference from the premise."
3593,"Reportedly the biggest payment made in such a case, it is hardly a nick in Texaco's annual revenue of more than $30 billion.",The biggest payment was a few million dollars.,1,0,False,"step 1: in the premise, it is stated that the biggest payment reportedly made in a case is barely a fraction of texaco's annual revenue, which is more than $30 billion. this implies that the biggest payment is significantly smaller than texaco's annual revenue.step 2: the hypothesis suggests that the biggest payment was only a few million dollars. this is in direct contradiction to the information in the premise, as a few million dollars represents a much smaller amount than the reportedly biggest payment.step 3: based on the logical analysis and the contradiction between the premise and hypothesis, the hypothesis cannot be logically inferred from the premise."
3594,well that's that's true yeah the uh the the biggest difference i got to agree was the idea that we were allowed to go and get it done rather than than set up a a line and say we're not going to let you cross this this point anymore and that really hurt the uh the people uh the Vietnam experience uh i got to admit that one,The soldiers were treated better this time than in Vietnam.,1,0,False,"step 1: in the premise, the speaker acknowledges that during the vietnam experience, the soldiers were not allowed to go and get something done, and this policy hurt the morale of the soldiers. step 2: the hypothesis suggests that the soldiers were treated better this time than in vietnam. this can be interpreted as an improvement in the way soldiers were treated or handled in the current situation compared to vietnam. step 3: the premise does not directly contradict the hypothesis. while the premise discusses a specific negative aspect of the vietnam experience, it does not necessarily mean that all aspects of the soldiers' treatment were worse. the hypothesis, therefore, is not logically inconsistent with the premise. however, the premise alone does not provide enough information to definitively infer the hypothesis. step 4: in order to determine if the hypothesis is entailed by the premise, additional context or information would be required to understand the specific ways in which the soldiers were treated better this time compared to vietnam."
3595,Blond tennis player pauses to view the crowd.,A tennis player is looking at the crowd.,1,1,True,"step 1: in the premise, a blond tennis player is identified as pausing to view the crowd. viewing the crowd is an action commonly associated with tennis players, often done between points or during breaks. no logical inconsistencies or contradictions are present in the premise or hypothesis.step 2: the hypothesis 'a tennis player is looking at the crowd' can be logically inferred from the premise 'blond tennis player pauses to view the crowd.' the hypothesis is a more general version of the premise, as it does not specify the color of the tennis player's hair but maintains the essential information about the tennis player's action.step 3: given the logical relationship between the premise and hypothesis, and the lack of contradictory information, the hypothesis can be inferred from the premise."
3596,But Hubbell won't break easily.,Hubbell works in rough conditions.,1,1,True,"step 1: in the premise, 'but hubbell won't break easily' indicates that hubbell has the ability to withstand rough conditions without being damaged. this suggests that hubbell is durable and robust.step 2: the hypothesis, 'hubbell works in rough conditions', suggests that hubbell functions adequately under harsh or difficult conditions. this is consistent with the premise, as a durable item is expected to function properly even in challenging environments.step 3: the hypothesis can be inferred from the premise because the ability to withstand rough conditions implies that hubbell is capable of operating effectively in such conditions. the premise suggests hubbell's durability, and the hypothesis extends this understanding to hubbell's functionality in rough conditions.step 4: there are no contradictory facts or logical inconsistencies between the premise and hypothesis.therefore, based on the logical reasoning, the hypothesis is a valid inference from the premise."
3597,yeah because when you're touristing you probably don't want to take the time to,Tourists don't take the time to see all the sites off the beaten path.,1,1,True,"step 1: in the premise, 'you're touristing' refers to being a tourist. the sentence implies that tourists have limited time and may focus on popular or well-known attractions instead of exploring lesser-known sites. this is a common observation about tourist behavior. in the hypothesis, 'tourists don't take the time to see all the sites off the beaten path,' the statement is describing a general trend or characteristic of tourists.step 2: the hypothesis can be inferred from the premise because the premise suggests that tourists prioritize popular sites over less-known ones due to time constraints. the hypothesis extends this idea to all sites off the beaten path, which is a logical consequence of the premise.step 3: based on the logical connection between the premise and hypothesis, and the common observation about tourist behavior, the hypothesis is a logical entailment of the premise."
3598,"Just a game of hide-and-seek, that's all.",Just a game of marco polo.,0,1,False,"step 1: both the premise and hypothesis describe scenarios where people are playing games. hide-and-seek and marco polo are both common games that involve hiding and seeking. the key difference between the two games lies in how the 'seeking' part is carried out. in hide-and-seek, one player hides, and the other players seek to find them. in marco polo, all players are in the water and call out 'marco' to be found by others who respond with 'polo'. step 2: although the games are different, they share similarities as they are both games where participants hide and seek. the hypothesis 'just a game of marco polo' can be seen as a more specific or alternative description of the premise 'just a game of hide-and-seek'. step 3: given the logical connection between the two games and the fact that the hypothesis provides a more detailed description of the premise, the hypothesis can be inferred from the premise. step 4: in summary, the hypothesis can be logically inferred from the premise as they refer to the same situation but describe it differently."
3599,"While it's true that expansion temporarily diluted the talent pool, the DH artificially increased offense, and players have gained the economic upper hand, there is a widespread consensus that the quality of the game itself is as good as or better than ever . Improvements in hitting have been matched by craftier pitching (by such hurlers as Atlanta's Greg Maddux and Baltimore's Mike Mussina).",The pool of talent broadened with the expansion.,0,0,True,"step 1: in the premise, there are several statements about major league baseball (mlb) and the expansion. the expansion is said to have temporarily diluted the talent pool, artificially increased offense through the designated hitter (dh), and given players an economic upper hand. a consensus exists that the game's quality is as good as or better than ever, with improvements in hitting and pitching.step 2: the hypothesis suggests that the pool of talent has broadened with the expansion. the premise does not explicitly state that the talent pool has broadened, but it does not contradict the hypothesis either. the presence of skilled hitters and pitchers, such as greg maddux and mike mussina, could indicate a larger talent pool due to increased opportunities for players, but it does not definitively prove it.step 3: based on the information provided, the hypothesis cannot be logically inferred from the premise. the premise describes various effects of the expansion, and while the broadening of the talent pool is a plausible outcome, it is not a necessary or logically deductible one. thus, the hypothesis is not entailed by the premise.step 4: it is worth noting that the hypothesis might be true, but it requires additional evidence beyond what is presented in the premise to be confirmed."
3600,He'd had a course of semantics in college and could see no relationship.,He had learned in first grade enough to see the relationship as it was. ,0,0,True,"step 1: in the premise, it is stated that the person had taken a college course in semantics but could not see a relationship. this implies that there is currently no relationship perceived by the person. the hypothesis suggests that the person had learned enough in first grade to see the relationship. step 2: the hypothesis directly contradicts the information in the premise, as the person's current inability to see the relationship cannot be logically inferred from having learned something in first grade. step 3: based on the logical inconsistency between the premise and hypothesis, it cannot be inferred that the hypothesis is entailed by the premise.label: 0"
3601,"Lordy, what bottle did he suck out a dream like that?",He had no dreams.,0,0,True,"step 1: in the premise, 'lordy, what bottle did he suck out a dream like that?' is an idiomatic expression used to express surprise or wonder about the origin of someone's dream or inspiration. it does not provide any factual information about the presence or absence of dreams in the subject. common sense tells us that the presence or absence of dreams is an internal state that cannot be determined from an external observation or statement.step 2: the hypothesis, 'he had no dreams,' is a contradictory statement to the premise, as the premise implies that lordy had a dream or a source of inspiration. the hypothesis cannot be logically inferred from the premise as it contradicts the information provided.step 3: based on the logical reasoning, lack of factual information in the premise, and the contradictory nature of the hypothesis, the hypothesis is not entailed by the premise."
3602,"Even in cases where constitutional or statutory challenges became apparent after representation was well under way, LSC advised that its attorneys must withdraw.",The LSC said their lawyers must never withdraw from there.,0,0,True,"step 1: in the premise, the legal services corporation (lsc) is stated to have advised their attorneys to withdraw when constitutional or statutory challenges arose during representation. this indicates a clear policy of lsc to withdraw in such situations. step 2: the hypothesis, 'the lsc said their lawyers must never withdraw', contradicts the premise as it suggests an opposite policy or action. the hypothesis does not logically follow from the premise. step 3: based on the given information, the hypothesis is not entailed by the premise."
3603,A lady with a purse on his shoulder reaching upward and putting a crown in a statue's hand.,There is a lady in her bikini swimming.,0,0,True,"step 1. the premise describes a scene of a lady performing an action of reaching upward and placing something in a statue's hand, while carrying a purse. no information is given about what the lady is wearing or if there is a swimming pool or body of water nearby.step 2. the hypothesis describes an entirely different scenario involving a lady in a bikini swimming. there is no logical or factual connection between the premise and hypothesis.step 3. based on the given information, the hypothesis cannot be logically inferred from the premise."
3604,"The city is a fascinating and congested labyrinth of churches, synagogues, mosques, noble houses and humble residences.",The city is nearly bare.,0,0,True,"step 1: in the premise, the city is described as having numerous religious structures and varied types of residences, suggesting a densely populated and culturally rich area. this is a common characteristic of a congested urban environment. step 2: the hypothesis, 'the city is nearly bare', contradicts the information given in the premise. a 'nearly bare' city would not have numerous religious structures, noble houses, or humble residences. the idea of a 'bare' city implies an absence of structures and inhabitants. step 3: based on the logical reasoning and the contradiction between the premise and hypothesis, the hypothesis is not entailed by the premise."
3605,"During the offseason, the Jazz signed free agents Matt Harpring, Calbert Cheaney and Mark Jackson.","During the offseason, the Jazz signed free agents Matt Harpring, Calbert Cheaney and Park Si.",0,0,True,"step 1: in the premise, the jazz are identified as a team that signed three specific free agents - matt harpring, calbert cheaney, and mark jackson - during the offseason. the hypothesis presents the same three names but includes an incorrect fourth name - park si.step 2: the hypothesis does not follow logically from the premise. the presence of an incorrect name in the hypothesis (park si) makes it inconsistent with the premise as stated.step 3: based on the logical analysis, the hypothesis is not entailed by the premise."
3606,They do not understand.,They were too stupid to understand even the simplest things.,0,0,True,"step 1: in the premise, 'they' refers to a group of people or beings, but the premise does not provide any information about their intelligence or reasons for not understanding. step 2: the hypothesis introduces the assumption that 'they' were 'too stupid' to understand, which goes beyond the information given in the premise. step 3: the hypothesis is not logically entailed by the premise, as the premise does not provide enough information to justify such a conclusion. therefore, the hypothesis cannot be inferred from the premise."
3607,Such a knowledgebased process enables decision makers to be reasonably certain about critical facets of the product under development when they need this knowledge.,They wanted to share what they have already researched.,1,0,False,"step 1: in the premise, it is stated that a knowledge-based process enables decision makers to be reasonably certain about critical facets of a product. this implies that the process provides reliable and accurate information. no specific mention is made about sharing this information with others.step 2: the hypothesis suggests that the individuals involved wanted to share what they have already researched. this action of sharing information does not contradict the premise, as both the premise and hypothesis describe different aspects of the situation.step 3: although the hypothesis does not logically follow from the premise, it does not contradict it either. the premise describes the function and reliability of the knowledge-based process, while the hypothesis describes an action taken by the individuals. neither statement negates the other.step 4: based on the given information, it is not possible to infer a definitive relationship between the premise and hypothesis.your final conclusion:the hypothesis 'they wanted to share what they have already researched' is not entailed by the premise 'such a knowledgebased process enables decision makers to be reasonably certain about critical facets of the product under development when they need this knowledge'."
3608,In the late afternoon they began again until nightfall.,They are in the middle of building a shelter.,1,1,True,"step 1: in the premise, 'they began again until nightfall' implies a continuous activity or process, but the nature of this activity is not explicitly stated. however, the context suggests that they could be doing a labor-intensive task, such as building a shelter. step 2: the hypothesis, 'they are in the middle of building a shelter', is consistent with the premise, as building a shelter would require a significant amount of time and effort, and continuing such a task until nightfall is reasonable. step 3: based on the information provided, the hypothesis can be reasonably inferred from the premise."
3609,"And now, on the evening of the 30th, in a private room at the Savoy, Mr. Julius P.",Mr. Julius P. was found dead in a private room at the Savoy.,0,1,False,"step 1: in the premise, it is stated that 'on the evening of the 30th, in a private room at the savoy, mr. julius p. was found'. this means that mr. julius p. was discovered in a specific location and time. step 2: the hypothesis also states that 'mr. julius p. was found dead in a private room at the savoy'. this is identical to the information in the premise, which describes the same person and location, but adds the detail of 'dead'. step 3: since the hypothesis is logically equivalent to the premise, but includes an additional detail, it is considered to be logically entailed by the premise. step 4: in other words, the hypothesis can be inferred from the premise because the premise sets the stage for the hypothesis to occur. step 5: it is important to note that the entailment here is due to the identical descriptions and the additional detail in the hypothesis, not due to any logical implication or inference from the meaning of the words in the premise or hypothesis."
3610,"Come fall and winter, surges and stumbles will really mean something.",Electrical failures will happen more in the fall and winter.,1,1,True,"step 1: the premise 'come fall and winter, surges and stumbles will really mean something' is an idiomatic expression often used to describe a situation where conditions become more severe or challenging. in this context, 'surges and stumbles' can be interpreted as power outages or electrical malfunctions. the seasons of fall and winter are known to bring about harsher weather conditions that can impact infrastructure and electrical systems.step 2: the hypothesis 'electrical failures will happen more in the fall and winter' is a direct consequence of the conditions described in the premise. the severity of conditions during fall and winter increases the likelihood of electrical failures. this relationship is logical and consistent with common sense, as extreme weather conditions can put additional stress on electrical systems.step 3: based on the logical reasoning and common sense understanding of the given information, the hypothesis 'electrical failures will happen more in the fall and winter' can be reasonably inferred from the premise 'come fall and winter, surges and stumbles will really mean something'."
3611,"Though Seti commissioned the temple between 1291 and 1279 b.c. , the colonnaded courtyards and ramps on its facade were added by his son Ramses II who usurped his father, trying every way possible to excise his name from the temple walls.",The temple is the largest in the land.,1,0,False,"step 1: the premise describes the construction of the temple by seti between 1291 and 1279 b.c., with the additions made by his son ramses ii. it does not provide any information about the size of the temple. step 2: the hypothesis claims that the temple is the largest in the land, which is not directly related to the information provided in the premise. the premise neither states nor implies that the temple is the largest in the land. step 3: based on the given information, the hypothesis cannot be logically inferred from the premise."
3612,"Acre's finest lodgings, with a beach and the country club's excellent facilities.",It's the worst lodging in Acre.,0,0,True,"step 1: in the premise, 'acre's finest lodgings' refers to accommodations known for their high quality, including a beach and country club facilities. this information implies a standard of excellence and comfort. step 2: the hypothesis, 'it's the worst lodging in acre', is a direct contradiction of the premise. it suggests that the lodgings described are of poor quality, the opposite of what the premise states. since a direct contradiction is not a logical implication, the hypothesis cannot be logically inferred from the premise. step 3: based on the logical reasoning, the hypothesis 'it's the worst lodging in acre' is not entailed by the premise 'acre's finest lodgings, with a beach and the country club's excellent facilities'."
3613,charity that's put it together but i know that that helps a lot with training and um,I know that helps with job skills training.,1,1,True,"step 1: in the premise, a charity is described as being involved in putting things together. while the specifics of what is being put together are not mentioned, it's reasonable to infer that this could refer to various activities, including job skills training. the use of the phrase 'but i know that that helps a lot' implies that the speaker has personal experience or knowledge of the charity's impact.step 2: the hypothesis states that 'i know that' helps with job skills training. given the context of the premise, it's a logical inference that 'i know that' refers to the charity. the hypothesis is consistent with the premise, as the premise suggests that the charity has a positive impact, and job skills training is a common type of support provided by charities.step 3: based on the logical connection between the premise and hypothesis, and the lack of contradictory information, the hypothesis can be inferred from the premise."
3614,"Her death was a shock and a distress, but she would not be passionately regretted. ",Everyone was ashamed for not being sadder. ,1,0,False,"step 1. the premise describes the speaker's emotional response to someone's death, stating that it was a shock and a distress but that they would not be passionately regretted. this implies that the speaker had a detached or muted emotional response to the deceased.step 2. the hypothesis suggests that 'everyone' felt shame for not being sadder. this implies that there was an expected emotional response (sadness) that was not met by everyone present.step 3. it is not logically entailed that everyone feeling ashamed for not being sadder can be inferred from the premise. the premise only establishes the speaker's emotional response and does not provide sufficient information about the emotions or actions of others. therefore, the hypothesis goes beyond the given information.step 4. the hypothesis contradicts the premise in the sense that it implies a stronger emotional response (shame) than the premise suggests for at least some people.thus, the hypothesis cannot be logically inferred from the premise."
3615,Graduates of the Academy are also given the option of entering the United States Army.,Graduates of the Academy are also given the option of entering the United States Army or United States Air Force.,1,1,True,"step 1: in the premise, it is stated that graduates of the academy have the option of entering the united states army. this implies that the academy provides military training or affiliation, but it does not exclude the possibility of other military branches. step 2: the hypothesis suggests an additional military branch (the united states air force) for graduates to join. this expansion does not contradict the premise because the option of joining the army is already given, and there's no information suggesting that academy graduates are limited to only one military branch. step 3: based on the given information and logical reasoning, the hypothesis can be inferred from the premise since the premise only sets a lower bound on the available military branches for graduates, and the hypothesis extends that bound while staying consistent with the facts."
3617,right yeah it's and it's uh it it's uh uh a hassle trying to to uh uh put your money all in the right in the savings you know in the right pockets i guess it would be a way to say it,Deciding where to invest your savings is easy.,0,0,True,"step 1: in the premise, the speaker is expressing difficulty in managing their savings by putting money in the right pockets. this implies that deciding where to invest savings is a non-trivial task. common sense and the information provided in the premise suggest that the hypothesis is not entailed. step 2: the hypothesis 'deciding where to invest your savings is easy' directly contradicts the premise's sentiment of it being a hassle. step 3: given that the hypothesis contradicts the premise and there is no logical connection or justification for the hypothesis based on the information in the premise, it cannot be logically inferred."
3620,"When it was victorious at the ballot box, among the new government's first tasks was to organize a referendum on Scottish devolution.","When it achieved victory at the ballot box, the governments first and only task was to organize a referendum on the devolution of Scotts.",1,0,False,"step 1: in the premise, we have a new government being victorious at the ballot box, which then goes on to organize a referendum on scottish devolution. this sequence of events implies that the organization of the referendum was one of the government's initial tasks. step 2: the hypothesis proposes that organizing a referendum on scottish devolution was the first and only task of the new government. while both sentences involve a referendum on scottish devolution, the hypothesis adds the condition that it was the government's sole task. step 3: to determine if the hypothesis can be logically inferred from the premise, we need to assess if it is a necessary consequence. the premise does not provide enough information to definitively conclude that it was the government's only task, as it mentions another task (organizing a referendum) but does not exclude the possibility of other tasks. therefore, the hypothesis cannot be logically inferred from the premise."
3621,Wolff writes that he jotted down bits of dialogue on his legal pads during meetings while others composed to-do lists.,Wolff write down dialogue on legal pads while other people made lists on their iPads.,1,0,False,"step 1: in the premise, wolff's action of jotting down dialogue on legal pads during meetings is described. this action implies that he was taking notes or recording information. there is no information given about the objects or tools used by others in the meetings.step 2: in the hypothesis, it is proposed that wolff used legal pads while others used ipads. there is a difference in the tools being used by wolff and the alleged 'others'. however, the premise does not provide enough information to infer the tools used by others.step 3: based on the given information, the hypothesis cannot be logically inferred from the premise, as the premise does not provide sufficient details about the tools or objects used by others in the meetings. the hypothesis introduces new information that is not directly implied or entailed by the premise."
3622,"In addition, we supported the creation of a 250-page Poverty Law Manual that introduces advocates to the fundamentals of poverty law.",The Poverty Law Manual was created to document poverty law opposition.,0,0,True,"step 1: in the premise, it is stated that a 250-page poverty law manual was created and introduced to advocates, providing them with an understanding of the fundamentals of poverty law. this information does not imply any opposition to poverty law. step 2: the hypothesis, which suggests that the poverty law manual was created to document poverty law opposition, contradicts the information in the premise. there is no logical connection or justification in the given context for this statement. step 3: based on the information provided in the premise, the hypothesis is not logically entailed and appears to be a contradictory and incorrect statement."
3623,Palma overshadows all other towns on Mallorca in the scale and sophistication of its shops.,Palma has dumpy shops.,0,0,True,"step 1: in the premise, it is stated that palma overshadows all other towns on mallorca in terms of scale and sophistication of its shops. this implies that palma has larger and more refined shops compared to other towns. step 2: the hypothesis, 'palma has dumpy shops', contradicts the information provided in the premise. dumpy shops are typically smaller, shabby, and less sophisticated than regular shops. the hypothesis is in clear contradiction with the premise's statement about the scale and sophistication of palma's shops. step 3: based on the logical reasoning and the contradiction between the hypothesis and the premise, the hypothesis is not entailed by the premise."
3624,"Russky Newsweek or ""Newsweek Russia"" was a Russian language news magazine published in Russia between 2004 and 2010 as the Russian edition of ""Newsweek"".","Ramkinkar Baij or ""Newsweek Russia"" was a Russian language news magazine published in Russia between 2004 and 2010 as the Russian edition of ""Newsweek"".",1,0,False,"step 1: both the premise and hypothesis describe a russian language news magazine called 'newsweek russia' that was published in russia between 2004 and 2010. the key difference is the name of the publisher mentioned in each sentence: russky newsweek in the premise, and ramkinkar baij in the hypothesis. however, the premise provides factual information about the existence and timeframe of 'newsweek russia', and it does not suggest or imply that ramkinkar baij was the publisher. step 2: the hypothesis does not logically follow from the premise because there is no information in the premise that allows the conclusion that ramkinkar baij was the publisher of 'newsweek russia'. the hypothesis introduces a new element (ramkinkar baij) that is not mentioned in the premise. step 3: based on the given information, the hypothesis is not entailed by the premise."
3625,They performed a very vital function for me.,I could not get by without them.,1,1,True,"step 1: a 'very vital function' refers to an essential role or service that is crucial for the proper functioning or survival of something. in this context, 'they' are the entities performing this function for 'me'. step 2: the hypothesis 'i could not get by without them' states that 'they' are indispensable to 'me'. this is a logical implication of the premise since a vital function implies that the absence of the function or the entities providing it would result in negative consequences for 'me'. step 3: based on the logical connection between the two statements and the common sense understanding of 'vital function' and 'indispensable', the hypothesis can be inferred from the premise."
3626,* EPA cost modeling for wet scrubber installations estimate 29 tons of limestone required to achieve 95 percent SO2 removal while burning a 4 percent sulfur coal.,Sulfur emissions from burning coal cannot be reduced by any known method.,0,0,True,"step 1: in the premise, we have the information that a certain amount of limestone is required to remove 95 percent of so2 emissions from coal combustion. this implies that sulfur emissions can be reduced, as the epa cost modeling is focused on finding methods to reduce these emissions. step 2: the hypothesis 'sulfur emissions from burning coal cannot be reduced by any known method' contradicts the information in the premise. the premise explicitly states a method (wet scrubber installations with limestone) that can reduce sulfur emissions. step 3: based on the logical reasoning that the hypothesis contradicts the premise, and the common-sense understanding that various methods are known to reduce sulfur emissions from coal combustion, the hypothesis is not entailed by the premise."
3627," VI  Red and Slim had trailed their elders with the experience of youth, aided by the absorption and anxiety of their fathers.",The elders were anxious of their fathers.,0,1,False,"step 1: the premise describes red and slim following their elders, with their actions influenced by the elders' anxiety towards their fathers. this implies that the elders have a fear or concern regarding their fathers. step 2: the hypothesis suggests that the elders are anxious about their fathers. this hypothesis is a rephrased version of the information in the premise. step 3: the hypothesis can be logically inferred from the premise because it is a restatement of the information provided in the premise, but presented from a different perspective."
3628,A man is standing in the aisle of a grocery store and staring at the cereal selection.,A man slips a box of cereal in his shirt.,0,0,True,"step 1: the premise describes a man standing and staring at cereal in a grocery store. there is no information given about him taking or hiding anything. common sense and factual consistency suggest that the man's actions could include selecting a box of cereal, reading the label, or making a decision about which cereal to buy. no information contradicts the hypothesis.step 2: the hypothesis involves the man slipping a box of cereal into his shirt, an action that is not explicitly mentioned or implied in the premise. however, the premise does not contradict the hypothesis, as the man's actions while in the aisle are not strictly limited to what is mentioned in the premise.step 3: based on the logical reasoning, common sense, and lack of contradictory facts, the hypothesis cannot be logically inferred from the premise, but it is not necessarily contradictory either. the premise provides insufficient information to confirm or deny the hypothesis."
3629,"In the early 1980s he worked for the Braves as an announcer along with Ernie Johnson, Skip Caray.","In the early 1980s he worked for the Braves as an announcer along with Ernie Johnson, Skip Caray and Pete Van Wieren.",1,1,True,"step 1. both the premise and hypothesis describe the same individual working for the braves as an announcer during the early 1980s. the premise mentions ernie johnson and skip caray as his colleagues, while the hypothesis adds pete van wieren. step 2. the hypothesis is consistent with the premise and does not contradict it. the additional information in the hypothesis (pete van wieren being an announcer colleague) can be inferred to be a logical extension of the premise, as it does not alter the original meaning. step 3. based on the logical consistency and extension of the premise, the hypothesis can be inferred from the premise."
3630,"We might as well try to eat something while I think about what to do with you.""  Malok and most of the others were gone when they reached the cave again.",They climbed to the top of the cliff and sat watching the ocean.,0,0,True,"step 1. in the premise, 'we might as well try to eat something while i think about what to do with you' is a statement made by malok to the group, possibly indicating a pause or delay in their actions. 'they were gone when they reached the cave again' implies that some time has passed since the initial statement was made. the context does not provide any clear information about the location or activity of 'they' during this time.step 2. the hypothesis suggests that 'they' climbed to the top of a cliff and sat watching the ocean. while this scenario is not directly inferred from the premise, it is not contradictory to it either. climbing a cliff and sitting to watch the ocean is a reasonable activity that could occur during a pause or delay, and there is no information in the premise that would make this impossible.step 3. based on the given information, the hypothesis is not logically entailed by the premise as there is no direct relationship between the actions described in the premise and the hypothesis. however, the hypothesis is not contradictory to the premise and is a possible explanation for what 'they' might have been doing during the time gap mentioned in the premise."
3631,Lucky Macau fit the specifications exactly.,Lucky Macau fell short of the specifications.,0,0,True,"step 1: in the premise, 'lucky macau fit the specifications exactly' implies that all the requirements and conditions of the specifications were met by lucky macau. this statement indicates a perfect match between lucky macau and the specifications.step 2: the hypothesis, 'lucky macau fell short of the specifications', suggests the opposite situation, where lucky macau does not meet all the requirements of the specifications.step 3: a direct logical inference from the premise to the hypothesis is not possible because the hypothesis contradicts the premise. in other words, if lucky macau fit the specifications exactly, then it is not possible for it to have fallen short of the specifications.step 4: it is important to note that the premise and hypothesis may refer to different specifications or that the hypothesis may be based on a subset of the specifications mentioned in the premise. however, the provided information does not include such context.step 5: based on the given information, the hypothesis cannot be logically inferred from the premise."
3632,It begins with a series of lighted panels illustrating the manuscript.,The manuscript would be hard to read without the lighted panels.,1,1,True,"step 1: in the premise, the manuscript is being illustrated through a series of lighted panels. this information does not directly state that the manuscript is hard to read without the lighted panels, but it does suggest that the panels are necessary for viewing the manuscript. common sense and logical reasoning suggest that illumination would make the manuscript easier to read, as lack of light can make written material difficult to decipher. step 2: the hypothesis 'the manuscript would be hard to read without the lighted panels' is consistent with the premise, as the necessity of the lighted panels implies a difficulty in reading the manuscript without them. step 3: based on the logical relationship between the premise and hypothesis, common sense reasoning, and lack of contradictory information, the hypothesis can be inferred from the premise."
3633,"Still, he added, ""I'm blest if I can see what his motive could have been."" I trembled. ",The motive for the crime was disturbing.,1,1,True,"step 1: in the premise, the speaker expresses his difficulty in understanding the motive behind a crime, suggesting that it was unclear or unusual. the use of the word 'blest' implies a sense of disbelief or shock. step 2: the hypothesis states that the motive was disturbing, which is a more specific description of something being unclear or unusual. it can be logically inferred that if the speaker found the motive difficult to understand or unusual, then it would be reasonable to consider it disturbing. step 3: based on the logical connection between the premise and hypothesis, the hypothesis can be inferred from the premise."
3634,"If the state planning body disagrees with the Vice President's decision, they may then request a face-to-face meeting with the LSC President to seek reconsideration of the Vice President's recommendation.",The state planning body cannot meet with the VP to discuss the decision. ,0,0,True,"step 1: in the premise, it is stated that if the state planning body disagrees with the vice president's decision, they have the option to request a face-to-face meeting with the lsc president to discuss the decision. this implies that under normal circumstances, such a meeting is a possibility. step 2: in the hypothesis, it is stated that the state planning body cannot meet with the vice president regarding the decision. however, the hypothesis does not mention any possible constraints on meeting with the lsc president. step 3: the hypothesis contradicts the premise, as the premise indicates that a face-to-face meeting with the vice president is not an option for the state planning body when they disagree with the decision, while the hypothesis states that they cannot meet with the vice president at all. step 4: based on the logical reasoning, the hypothesis cannot be inferred from the premise as it contradicts it."
3635,i had stuff for like Sanger Harris and you know it got up like to couple of hundred dollars and i thought well that's okay cause all they wanted was ten dollars a month right  i wasn't thinking a thing about it,It was not okay by any means that they wanted to charge me ten dollars a month.,0,0,True,"step 1: in the premise, the speaker mentions having spent a significant amount of money, approximately $200, on purchases from sanger harris. the speaker's initial thought is that the ten dollars a month charge is acceptable. step 2: the hypothesis expresses a contrasting perspective, asserting that the ten dollars a month charge was not okay. step 3: the speaker's initial thought or perception in the premise does not necessarily imply that ten dollars a month is a reasonable or acceptable charge for everyone, especially when considering a larger financial context. the hypothesis introduces a different perspective, which may be valid based on personal financial circumstances or other factors not mentioned in the premise. however, the hypothesis cannot be logically inferred from the premise as it goes beyond the information provided. step 4: the hypothesis is not entailed by the premise as it introduces new information that contradicts or alters the original context."
3636,"Every so often one of our whipmasters would end up murdered, strangled, or throat cut, and we would suspect Stark's hand in it but we worried about revolt if we punished or executed him.",Ten of the whipmasters got killed in the first year.,1,0,False,"step 1: the premise describes a series of incidents where whipmasters are murdered, and there is a suspicion that stark is involved. no specific number of murders is mentioned, but it is stated that 'every so often' one occurs. step 2: the hypothesis specifies that ten whipmasters were killed in the first year. this number is not mentioned in the premise, but it is reasonable to infer that the number of murders described in the premise could be ten or more, given the use of the phrase 'every so often'. step 3: the hypothesis can be inferred from the premise because the premise sets up a scenario where multiple whipmasters are murdered, and the hypothesis provides a specific number for this event. however, the hypothesis is not logically entailed by the premise, as the premise does not limit the number of murders to ten. step 4: it is important to note that while the hypothesis can be inferred from the premise, it may not be factually accurate if the actual number of murders was different from ten. the hypothesis is only a possible conclusion based on the given information."
3637,"Finally, all entity determinations of the applicability of stewardship standards should be thoroughly documented.",No documentation is necessary for any entity determination.,0,0,True,"step 1: in the premise, it is stated that all entity determinations of the applicability of stewardship standards must be thoroughly documented. this implies that documentation is a necessary part of the process. step 2: the hypothesis contradicts the premise as it states that no documentation is necessary. step 3: given that the premise and hypothesis are contradictory, the hypothesis cannot be logically inferred from the premise.step 4: furthermore, logical principles dictate that a conclusion cannot contradict the premises from which it is drawn. common sense also supports this conclusion, as thorough documentation is a standard practice in many fields, including financial reporting and regulatory compliance, to ensure transparency, accountability, and accuracy.step 5: in summary, the hypothesis 'no documentation is necessary for any entity determination' is not logically entailed by the premise 'finally, all entity determinations of the applicability of stewardship standards should be thoroughly documented' and contradicts it."
3638,They are in the Reform Party.,They are in the Republican Party.,0,0,True,"step 1: the reform party and the republican party are political parties in the united states. historically, there have been significant ideological overlaps and mergers between the two parties. while they are not the same, members of one party can also be members of the other. step 2: the hypothesis suggesting that 'they' are in the republican party is not directly entailed by the premise that 'they' are in the reform party. however, given the historical ties between the two parties, it is not impossible for the premise to be true and the hypothesis to also be true. step 3: based on the available information, the hypothesis is not logically entailed by the premise, but it is not a contradiction either. the lack of explicit contradiction, along with the historical context of political party affiliations, makes it possible, although not guaranteed, that the hypothesis could be true."
3639,Exhibit A-5 in Appendix A depicts the timeline expected for completing a single unit installation of ACI.,Exhibit A-5 in Appendix A depicts a picture of a dog.,0,0,True,"step 1. the premise describes exhibit a-5 as a depiction of a timeline for completing a single unit installation of aci. it provides no information about the nature or content of exhibit a-5 itself. step 2. the hypothesis suggests that exhibit a-5 is a picture of a dog. however, there is no logical or factual connection between the premise and the hypothesis. step 3. based on the information provided, the hypothesis cannot be reasonably inferred from the premise."
3640,In August 1994 Castro suddenly lifted restrictions on those wishing to leave (coastal patrols usually force potential emigres to return).,Castro lifted restrictions in 1994 and allowed the Cubans more freedom.,1,1,True,"step 1. in the premise, castro's sudden lifting of restrictions in august 1994 is mentioned, which allowed people to leave cuba without being forced back. this indicates a significant change in policy, likely leading to more freedom for the people. step 2. the hypothesis also mentions that castro lifted restrictions in 1994 and that it led to more freedom. this hypothesis aligns with the information in the premise. step 3. from this logical and factual perspective, the hypothesis can be inferred from the premise. the premise does not explicitly state that castro granted more freedom, but the implication is clear. thus, the hypothesis is an accurate and reasonable inference from the premise."
3641,oh thank God i've never been to Midland,I go to Midland every other weekend. ,0,0,True,"step 1: in the premise, the speaker expresses relief that they have never been to midland. this statement provides no specific information about the speaker's habits or routines. in the hypothesis, the subject goes to midland every other weekend. these two sentences describe different situations.step 2: the hypothesis contradicts the premise because the speaker in the premise has never been to midland, whereas the hypothesis states that the subject goes there regularly.step 3: based on the logical negation of the premise and the contradictory nature of the hypothesis, it cannot be inferred from the premise."
3642,Anubis (God of Mummification) has a small temple here and you will clearly see his jackal-headed form on the walls.,The God of Mummification had a head of a horse.,0,0,True,"step 1: the premise describes anubis, the god of mummification, and mentions that his jackal-headed form can be seen on the temple walls. this information establishes anubis' identity and appearance. anubis is known as the god of mummification in ancient egyptian mythology. step 2: the hypothesis, however, states that anubis had a head of a horse. this is not consistent with the information provided in the premise. anubis is widely recognized for having the head of a jackal. step 3: based on the logical analysis, the hypothesis that 'the god of mummification had a head of a horse' is not entailed by the premise, as the premise does not provide any evidence to support this claim."
3643,uh-huh oh yeah that's right you would yeah,Definitely. ,1,1,True,"step 1: in this example, both the premise and hypothesis are affirmative statements expressing agreement or confirmation. they share similar meaning and do not contain any contradictory information.step 2: the hypothesis 'definitely' can be logically inferred from the premise 'uh-hah oh yeah that's right you would' because the premise implies agreement or confirmation, and 'definitely' is a stronger affirmation of agreement.step 3: based on the logical relationship between the two statements, the hypothesis can be inferred from the premise."
3645,The quadrangle covers an approximate area of a little over 3 % of Mars ’ surface area.,"The quadrangle covers an approximate area of 4.9 million square km, or a little over 3% of Mars’ surface area.",1,1,True,"step 1: in the premise, it is mentioned that the quadrangle covers an approximate area of a little over 3 % of mars’ surface area. this means that the quadrangle occupies 3.x% of mars’ total surface area, where x is a number greater than 0 and less than 1. step 2: in the hypothesis, it is stated that the quadrangle covers an approximate area of 4.9 million square km, or a little over 3% of mars’ surface area. this statement implies that 3.03% (a little over 3%) of mars’ total surface area is covered by the quadrangle, which is equivalent to 4.9 million square km. step 3: the hypothesis is logically equivalent to the premise since both statements convey the same information, i.e., the approximate area covered by the quadrangle and its percentage of mars’ surface area."
3646,Possibly the finest criminal brain of the age.,One of the worst criminal brains in history.,0,0,True,"step 1: in the premise, the phrase 'possibly the finest criminal brain of the age' implies a high level of intelligence or cunning in the criminal being referred to. however, it does not necessarily mean that the criminal is morally good or ethical. step 2: the hypothesis 'one of the worst criminal brains in history' contradicts the premise, as it suggests a very low level of criminal intelligence or cunning. step 3: based on the information in the premise and hypothesis, it cannot be logically inferred that the hypothesis is entailed by the premise. in fact, the hypothesis directly contradicts the premise."
3647,Adrin smiled.,Adrin frowned.,0,0,True,"step 1: the premise only provides information about adrin smiling. it does not provide any context or information about adrin's facial expression before or after the smiling event, or any reason for the smiling. step 2: the hypothesis, on the other hand, states that adrin frowned. this directly contradicts the information provided in the premise. step 3: based on the logical reasoning, common sense, and the contradictory nature of the hypothesis to the premise, the hypothesis cannot be inferred from the premise."
3648,she's happy as as heck uh and they serve meals of course,She's really upset about the death of her friend.,0,0,True,"step 1: in the premise, 'she's happy as as heck' implies a state of great joy or happiness. there's no explicit mention of any misfortune or sadness. the second part of the premise, 'they serve meals of course', is unrelated to the emotional state of 'she'. step 2: the hypothesis, 'she's really upset about the death of her friend', suggests a state of sadness or distress. there is no information in the premise that supports this hypothesis. step 3: based on the given information, the hypothesis 'she's really upset about the death of her friend' cannot be logically inferred from the premise 'she's happy as as heck uh and they serve meals of course'."
3649,Small red airplane flies over mountaintop dropping red substance over fire.,the plane is crashing,0,0,True,"step 1: in the premise, a small red airplane flies over a mountaintop and drops a red substance over a fire. this scenario implies that the plane is performing an aerial operation, possibly related to forest management or firefighting. the use of the word 'substance' rather than 'bombs' or 'bombshells' suggests that the red material being dropped is not destructive in nature. common sense and factual knowledge do not support the hypothesis that the plane is crashing.step 2: the hypothesis 'the plane is crashing' contradicts the premise in several ways. first, the premise states that the plane is flying, not crashing. second, the scenario described in the premise does not suggest any trouble or danger for the plane.step 3: based on the logical reasoning, common sense, and lack of evidence supporting the hypothesis, the hypothesis 'the plane is crashing' is not entailed by the premise."
3650,"Sample before buying, especially the cheaper wines.",Only some of the wines are any good.,1,1,True,"step 1: in the premise, it is advised to sample before buying, especially for cheaper wines. this implies that the quality of these wines is uncertain, and the sampling process is used to assess their worth. step 2: the hypothesis suggests that only some of the wines are good, meaning not all wines are of satisfactory quality. this is consistent with the information in the premise, which also indicates uncertainty in the quality of the cheaper wines. step 3: based on the logical connection between the premise and hypothesis, and the common sense understanding that not all wines in a given category may be of the same quality, the hypothesis can be inferred from the premise."
3651,yeah rotationary thing,It's set up to be on a rotation because we've found it's easiest that way.,1,1,True,"step 1: in the premise, the term 'rotationary thing' is used to describe an object. there is no explicit information provided about why this object is set up to rotate. however, the hypothesis suggests that the rotation is the easiest way to set it up.step 2: the hypothesis does not contradict the premise, as the hypothesis is a possible explanation for why the object in the premise is a 'rotationary thing'. the hypothesis is not directly implied by the premise, but it is a reasonable inference based on the given context.step 3: based on the lack of contradiction between the premise and hypothesis, and the possibility that the hypothesis could be a valid explanation for the 'rotationary thing' described in the premise, the hypothesis can be considered as a logical inference from the premise, although not a strictly entailed one.step 4: the label is set to 1, indicating that the hypothesis is a possible inference from the premise."
3652,Such risks are of particular concern at the federal level.,"The risks are only concerning at the local level, not the federal level.",0,0,True,"step 1: the premise states that risks are of concern at the federal level. this indicates that there is an acknowledgement of risks existing and being a matter of importance at the federal level.step 2: the hypothesis suggests that the risks are only concerning at the local level, implying that they are not a matter of importance or concern at the federal level.step 3: the hypothesis directly contradicts the premise by stating that the risks are not of concern at the federal level, whereas the premise states that they are. there is no logical connection or justification for the hypothesis based on the given information in the premise.step 4: common sense reasoning tells us that if risks are of concern at one level (federal), they can potentially be of concern at other levels (local), as risks can have far-reaching implications. however, the hypothesis asserts that the risks are only of concern at the local level, which contradicts the information in the premise.step 5: the hypothesis cannot be logically inferred from the premise, as it contradicts the given information and there is no justification for the hypothesis based on the premise or logical principles.step 6: based on the contradictory nature of the hypothesis and the premise, the hypothesis is not entailed by the premise."
3653,Jon drew his rapier and ran forward.,Jon was unarmed and stationary.,0,0,True,"step 1: the premise states that jon drew his rapier and ran forward. this indicates that jon was carrying a sword and moving. step 2: the hypothesis suggests that jon was unarmed and stationary. this directly contradicts the information in the premise, as jon is described as having a rapier and moving forward. step 3: based on the logical inconsistency between the premise and hypothesis, and the fact that the hypothesis contradicts the key information in the premise, it cannot be logically inferred from the premise."
3654,Critical acclaim ensues.,"When critics denounce the work, critical acclaim ensues.",0,0,True,"step 1: the premise 'critical acclaim ensues' implies that a work has received positive reviews and recognition from critics. it does not specify any particular conditions under which this critical acclaim occurs. step 2: the hypothesis 'when critics denounce the work, critical acclaim ensues' suggests a contradictory situation where critical denouncement leads to critical acclaim. this is a logical contradiction, as critical denouncement is generally considered to be the opposite of critical acclaim. step 3: based on the logical inconsistency between the premise and hypothesis, it is not possible for the hypothesis to be logically inferred from the premise."
3655,"They say that the police mishandled the crime scene , allowing John Ramsey to search the house, and point out that the police let the couple leave town for several weeks prior to questioning them.",The crime scene was handled perfectly and the Ramsey's fully cooperated with the police.,0,0,True,"step 1. in the premise, it is stated that the police mishandled the crime scene, which allows john ramsey to search the house, and they also let the ramsey's leave town for several weeks before questioning them. this implies that the police actions may have potentially compromised the investigation, as they might have given john ramsey an opportunity to tamper with evidence or destroy potential clues. these actions would not be consistent with handling the crime scene perfectly. moreover, allowing the ramsey's to leave town before questioning them could have resulted in the loss of crucial information or witness interviews. cooperating fully with the police would typically involve providing access to the crime scene and being questioned promptly.step 2. the hypothesis states that the crime scene was handled perfectly and the ramsey's fully cooperated with the police. this directly contradicts the premise, as the premise implies that the police did not handle the crime scene perfectly and the ramsey's did not fully cooperate with the police. the hypothesis cannot be logically inferred from the premise.step 3: based on the logical reasoning and contradiction between the premise and hypothesis, the hypothesis is not entailed by the premise."
3656,"The north tower, the Tour Saint-Romain, has the sober simplicity of the cathedral's early Gothic beginnings in the 12th century, while the taller, more elaborate south tower, the Tour de Beurre, is Flamboyant Gothic of the 15th century.","The north tower is very simple, with just limestone blocks and one cross.",1,1,True,"step 1: in the premise, the tour saint-romain (north tower) is described as having the sober simplicity of the early gothic period (12th century) and being made of limestone blocks. this implies a simple design, consistent with having just limestone blocks and one cross as described in the hypothesis. there are no contradictory facts or logical inconsistencies in the premise or hypothesis.step 2: the hypothesis 'the north tower is very simple, with just limestone blocks and one cross' can be logically inferred from the premise 'the north tower is of the early gothic period (12th century) and is made of limestone blocks'. the simplicity and the material described in the hypothesis are consistent with the premise's description of the north tower's early gothic origin and limestone construction.step 3: based on the logical reasoning and the consistency of the information between the premise and hypothesis, the hypothesis can be inferred from the premise."
3657,I was a Superior Court judge in Thurston County in 1980.,I enjoyed my time as a judge.,1,0,False,"step 1: in the premise, the person is identified as a superior court judge in thurston county during the year 1980. this information does not inherently convey any emotions or attitudes towards their judicial role. however, it is a common assumption that individuals generally have a sense of satisfaction or enjoyment when they are successful in their careers, especially in positions of authority and responsibility such as a judge. step 2: the hypothesis 'i enjoyed my time as a judge' is not directly stated in the premise. however, it can be inferred from the common sense assumption that individuals typically enjoy their successful careers. step 3: based on the common sense assumption that individuals generally enjoy their successful careers and the lack of contradictory information in the premise, the hypothesis 'i enjoyed my time as a judge' can be reasonably inferred from the premise.step 4: it is essential to note that while the hypothesis can be inferred from the premise, the premise itself does not make the enjoyment a necessary or entailed condition of being a superior court judge in thurston county during 1980. there could be cases where individuals hold such positions but do not enjoy them. however, the hypothesis being inferred from the premise does not contradict the premise or introduce any factually incorrect information."
3658,but uh but they don't require a lot if the only the problem that i've seen in the past is like when you've got uh if you've got natural gas and heat of course you don't in the east i suppose you don't have a lot of natural gas heat but if you don't have your y our heat adjusted your gas adjusted right then you can get some stains you know on the ceilings and you know ceiling ceiling,Natural gas and heat is the best way to keep ceilings from becoming stained. ,0,1,False,"step 1: in the premise, the speaker is discussing issues they have encountered with stains on ceilings, specifically mentioning natural gas and heat as a problem when not adjusted properly. they also suggest that proper adjustment prevents stains. step 2: the hypothesis makes a broader claim that natural gas and heat is the best way to keep ceilings from becoming stained. this can be inferred from the premise as the speaker's experience indicates that when natural gas and heat are properly adjusted, ceilings do not get stained. step 3: based on the logical connection between the premise and hypothesis, the hypothesis can be inferred from the premise."
3659,"By then Gore will be campaigning seriously, distancing himself from Clinton, and running macho ads; Bradley will have defined his big ideas and endured the inevitable media backlash to his current rave notices; and the voters will actually be paying attention.",Gore is going to try to stay far away from Clinton's bad reputation.,1,1,True,"step 1: in the premise, it is suggested that as the presidential campaign progresses, gore will be taking steps to distance himself from clinton. this could be inferred to mean that gore will be trying to differentiate himself from her and her controversies. it is a common political strategy for a candidate to distance themselves from a less popular or controversial figure in their party. step 2: the hypothesis states that gore is going to 'try to stay far away from clinton's bad reputation.' this is logically consistent with the premise, as the premise indicates that gore will be taking steps to distance himself from clinton. step 3: based on the logical consistency between the premise and hypothesis, and the common sense understanding of political strategies, the hypothesis can be inferred from the premise."
3660,I don't suppose that everyone is like that.,I doubt everyone is a lying liar who lies. ,1,1,True,"step 1: the premise expresses a doubt or skepticism about the general behavior or character of a group of people. it does not specify the nature of the behavior in question, leaving room for various interpretations. the hypothesis also expresses a doubt, but it specifically refers to the act of lying.  step 2: the hypothesis can be logically inferred from the premise because lying is a particular type of behavior. if one doubts that everyone is 'like that', that is, exhibiting a certain behavior, then doubting that everyone is a 'lying liar who lies' is a reasonable extension of that doubt.  step 3: based on the logical relationship between the premise and hypothesis, and the lack of contradictory information, the hypothesis can be inferred from the premise."
3661,"In 1982, Wallace won his last race for governor with a quarter of the black votes cast in the Democratic primary, a fact alluded to in a written epilogue at the end of the film.",Wallace was reelected as governor.,1,1,True,"step 1: in the premise, it is mentioned that wallace won the last race for governor in 1982 with a quarter of the black votes cast in the democratic primary. this implies that wallace was successful in securing a significant portion of the black vote, which was crucial for his victory in the race.step 2: the hypothesis states that wallace was reelected as governor. winning the last race for governor implies that wallace was reelected, assuming no interruptions or changes in the political landscape between elections. the hypothesis can be considered a logical consequence of the premise.step 3: based on the logical reasoning and the absence of contradictory information in the premise, the hypothesis is entailed by the premise."
3662,but you can just snack on it,It is not good for snacking.,0,0,True,"step 1: the premise describes a situation where something can be used for snacking. step 2: the hypothesis asserts that it is not good for snacking. the negation in the hypothesis contradicts the information in the premise. step 3: based on the logical negation of the premise, the hypothesis cannot be logically inferred from the premise.step 4: common sense also suggests that the hypothesis is not entailed by the premise, as the premise does not provide any information about the quality or healthiness of the item being snacked on.therefore, the hypothesis is not entailed by the premise."
3663,"It yielded, and he slipped inside.",He couldn't get in the door,0,0,True,"step 1: in the premise, 'it yielded' is an ambiguous term. it could mean 'gave way' or 'surrendered' in the context of an object, such as a door. 'he slipped inside' implies that the person was able to enter a space. the lack of clear information about the nature of 'it' makes it difficult to directly infer the hypothesis.step 2: the hypothesis 'he couldn't get in the door' contradicts the information in the premise that 'he slipped inside'. this contradiction indicates that the hypothesis cannot be logically inferred from the premise.step 3: based on the available information and logical reasoning, the hypothesis 'he couldn't get in the door' is not entailed by the premise."
3665,um so it's just different terminology for the same thing,It is like saying it the same way.,0,1,False,"step 1: in the premise, 'different terminology for the same thing' indicates that two expressions convey the same meaning. in the hypothesis, 'it is like saying it the same way' also suggests that the two statements express the same idea.step 2: the hypothesis can be logically inferred from the premise because if two things are the same, saying them in different ways will result in expressions that convey the same meaning.step 3: given the logical connection between the premise and hypothesis, and the lack of contradictory information, the hypothesis is entailed by the premise."
3666,"It's possible that this train's been programmed not to stop,' I said.",The train might be programmed to stop before it got to the end of the bridge. ,1,0,False,"step 1: the premise expresses a possibility, 'it's possible that this train's been programmed not to stop.' this means that there is a non-zero probability that the condition mentioned (the train being programmed not to stop) is true. however, it does not provide definitive proof or contradict any facts that would make the hypothesis impossible.step 2: the hypothesis introduces an alternative possibility, 'might be programmed to stop,' before it gets to the end of the bridge. this possibility is not contradictory to the premise as both 'stop' and 'not stop' are possibilities.step 3: based on the given information, there is no logical entailment or contradiction between the premise and the hypothesis. the hypothesis is not entailed by the premise, but it's also not contradictory. the premise leaves open the possibility for the train to be programmed to stop as stated in the hypothesis. thus, the hypothesis is not logical entailed by the premise, but it is not a contradiction either."
3667,"Since 1909 this building has marked the confluence of the Gombak and Klang Rivers, where tin miners loaded supplies to be sent upriver and unloaded their tin for shipment west to Port Klang, and where the city's roots were set down.",This building is no where near the rivers.,0,0,True,"step 1: the premise describes a building that has historical significance as the site of the confluence of the gombak and klang rivers. it mentions that tin miners used this location to load supplies for transport upriver and unload their tin for shipment. the city's origins are tied to this spot. step 2: the hypothesis directly contradicts the premise by stating that the building is nowhere near the rivers. step 3: given the detailed descriptions of the building's historical context and its location at the riverside in the premise, it is unlikely that the hypothesis can be inferred from the premise. in fact, the hypothesis goes against the central information presented in the premise. step 4: based on the logical contradiction between the premise and hypothesis, and the lack of any information in the premise that could reasonably lead to the hypothesis, the hypothesis is not entailed by the premise."
3668,"A job dealing with employee training might have as themes decisions about training needs, how employees are selected for training, how course quality is monitored, or how employees and supervisors view the purpose of training.","A job dealing with management training might have as themes, decisions about who to hire.",1,0,False,"step 1: in the premise, we have a description of various themes that could be present in a job dealing with employee training. these themes include decisions about training needs, employee selection, course quality, and employee and supervisor perspectives. step 2: the hypothesis suggests that a job dealing with management training may have themes related to hiring decisions. while the premise does mention employee selection as a possible theme, it does not explicitly state that hiring decisions are the only or even the main themes for management training. step 3: based on the given information, it is not clear that the hypothesis can be logically inferred from the premise. the premise leaves open the possibility that there are other themes in management training beyond hiring decisions. thus, the hypothesis is not entailed by the premise.step 4: it is important to note that while the hypothesis is not logically inferred from the premise, it is still possible that the hypothesis could be true. the premise only describes possible themes for employee training jobs; it does not exclude the possibility that hiring decisions are a theme in management training. the hypothesis simply suggests a narrower focus within the broader category of employee training.therefore, based on the given information, the hypothesis is not logically entailed by the premise, but it could still be true."
3669,"The craziest poor sucker in a group of 20,000 bidders on the Internet is likely to be crazier than the craziest one among 200 in a Burbank hotel ballroom.","20,000 people bid for it on ebay.",1,0,False,"step 1. in the premise, the comparison is made between the craziest poor sucker in a group of 20,000 bidders and the craziest one among 200 in a burbank hotel ballroom. the comparison implies that the situation in the ballroom involves fewer people. however, no specific information is given about where or how the bidding occurred for the 20,000 people.step 2. the hypothesis describes a specific context for the bidding, stating that it took place on ebay. while the hypothesis does not directly state that there were 20,000 bidders on ebay, it is possible that the hypothesis could be true if the bidding on ebay involved a large number of participants. however, the premise does not entail or logically imply that the bidding took place on ebay.step 3. based on the given information, the hypothesis '20,000 people bid for it on ebay' cannot be logically inferred from the premise. the premise only establishes that the craziest poor sucker in a larger group is likely to be crazier than the craziest one in a smaller group, and it does not specify the location or method of the bidding. therefore, the hypothesis is not entailed by the premise."
3670,I have met a woman whom I am attracted to.,I am attracted to a woman I met yesterday.,1,0,False,"step 1: the premise states that you have met a woman whom you are attracted to, indicating a current state of attraction towards a specific woman. no specific information is given about when you met this woman. step 2: the hypothesis suggests that you are attracted to a woman you met yesterday. this does not logically follow the premise since the woman in the premise has not been identified as the woman you met yesterday. step 3: based on the given information, there is not enough logical connection or common sense reasoning to infer that the hypothesis is entailed by the premise.step 4: it's important to note that while the hypothesis cannot be logically inferred from the premise, it doesn't contradict it either. the hypothesis is a separate statement and can potentially be true, depending on whether you met the woman you are attracted to yesterday or not."
3672,A follow-up survey of the 415 participants in the year 199W showed that 80% were earning at least as much as they were earning in their Navy contractor positions., A follow-up survey of the 415 participants was taken twice as the results got lost initially.,1,0,False,"step 1: in the premise, it is stated that a follow-up survey of the 415 participants was conducted and the results showed that 80% of them were earning at least as much as in their navy contractor positions. no information is provided about any previous surveys or reasons for conducting multiple surveys.step 2: the hypothesis suggests that the survey was taken twice, but it does not mention any reasons for this or any implications for the results. we cannot logically infer the hypothesis from the premise based on the given information alone.step 3: the hypothesis is not entailed by the premise as there is no logical connection or implication of multiple surveys from the provided information."
3673,The Balearics' fine sandy beaches and sunny weather make them an ideal family destination.,Sunny beaches attract senior citizens to the Balearics.,1,1,True,"step 1: in the premise, it is stated that the balearics have fine sandy beaches and sunny weather, which makes them an ideal family destination. the information provided does not directly mention senior citizens. however, the context implies that the balearics are a popular destination for families due to the appealing weather and beaches. step 2: the hypothesis suggests that sunny beaches attract senior citizens to the balearics. this statement is not directly contradictory to the premise but rather an additional implication. it is a common sense assumption that senior citizens often prefer sunny and warm destinations for relaxation and leisure. step 3: although the premise and hypothesis deal with different demographic groups (families and senior citizens), the hypothesis can be logically inferred from the premise because the sunny weather and sandy beaches that attract families can also be attractive to senior citizens. both the logical principles and common-sense reasoning support this inference. step 4: based on the premise and hypothesis, the hypothesis is an extension or implication of the premise, as it focuses on another demographic group that is likely to be attracted to the same appealing conditions. therefore, the hypothesis is entailed by the premise."
3674,"The artist painted himself with palette in hand at the left side of his own masterpiece, in a sense part of the family, as he became in real life.",The artist refused to use himself as a subject for his paintings.,0,0,True,"step 1: in the premise, the artist is described as painting himself as a subject for his masterpiece, which contradicts the hypothesis that he refused to use himself as a subject. step 2: the hypothesis is not logically entailed by the premise, as the premise directly states that the artist did paint himself as a subject. step 3: based on the given information, the hypothesis is not entailed by the premise."
3676,Two women in bathing suits are together in a two-seat kayak in water with trees in the background.,People enjoying a day with nature in their kayak.,1,1,True,"step 1: in the premise, we have the information that there are two women in bathing suits in a two-seat kayak, and they are in a body of water with trees in the background. this implies that they are engaging in a recreational activity, likely enjoying a day out in nature. common sense and experiences tell us that people often engage in such activities in nature for relaxation and enjoyment.step 2: the hypothesis 'people enjoying a day with nature in their kayak' can be logically inferred from the premise because it captures the essence of the scene described in the premise. the hypothesis expands on the information provided by the premise, making it a reasonable and logical conclusion.step 3: based on the logical reasoning, common sense, and the lack of contradictory information, the hypothesis is a logical entailment of the premise."
3677,it probably changed my political views it changed my understanding of the world around me,I still have the same political views.,0,0,True,"step 1: in the premise, the speaker mentions that 'it' (presumably an idea or experience) changed their political views and their understanding of the world. this implies that the speaker had political views before the change and now holds different views. step 2: the hypothesis states that the speaker still has the same political views. this directly contradicts the premise, as the premise states that the speaker's political views have changed. step 3: based on the logical contradiction between the premise and hypothesis, the hypothesis cannot be logically inferred from the premise.step 4: it is important to note that the premise and hypothesis might be true or false in reality, but the task at hand is to determine if the hypothesis can be logically inferred from the premise, not to evaluate their factual truth."
3678,"Formerly waterspouts, these now stay dry.",It is unknown why the waterspouts have become dry.,1,0,False,"step 1: in the premise, the sentence describes how 'these' (implying a specific set of waterspouts) have changed from being 'waterspouts' to 'those that stay dry'. the term 'waterspouts' refers to a meteorological phenomenon where jets of water are forcefully ejected from the surface of a body of water, typically caused by a strong wind. the new description 'those that stay dry' means that the waterspouts no longer function as such, i.e., they no longer eject water.step 2: the hypothesis does not provide any information about why the waterspouts have become dry. it simply states that the reason is 'unknown'.step 3: from the premise, it can be inferred that the waterspouts have stopped functioning as waterspouts. however, the premise does not provide any information about the cause of this change. the hypothesis is not directly inferred from the premise.step 4: although the hypothesis is not logically inferred from the premise, it is consistent with the premise as both describe the same phenomenon but focus on different aspects.step 5: based on the given information, the hypothesis 'it is unknown why the waterspouts have become dry' cannot be logically inferred from the premise 'formerly waterspouts, these now stay dry'."
3679,Why not say so?,Why not tell them they can't fly then?,1,0,False,"step 1: in the premise, 'why not say so?' is a rhetorical question likely implying a reason for not speaking directly. it does not provide any explicit information about a specific situation or context. the hypothesis, 'why not tell them they can't fly then?' is a suggestion to change the subject of the conversation, but it does not logically follow from the premise. step 2: there is no clear connection between the premise and hypothesis as both questions are different and refer to distinct situations. the hypothesis is not a logical inference from the premise. step 3: based on the analysis, the hypothesis is not entailed by the premise."
3680,Make it an hour.,It will take no more than a few seconds.,0,0,True,"step 1: in the premise, the phrase 'make it an hour' is an instruction or command to extend the duration of a given situation or event by one hour. this does not provide any information about the nature of the situation or event itself. in the hypothesis, 'it will take no more than a few seconds' indicates a very short duration of time.step 2: the hypothesis contradicts the premise because the short duration stated in the hypothesis is incompatible with the hour-long duration instructed in the premise.step 3: based on the logical inconsistency between the premise and hypothesis, the hypothesis cannot be logically inferred from the premise.step 4: it's important to note that the premise does not provide any information about the duration of the situation or event itself, so making the assumption that the hypothesis is about the same situation or event as the premise is not valid."
3681,"At some point, however, it is possible that private industry would rise to the occasion and collect virtually all of the mail, process it, and give it to the postal service for delivery.",It is not possible for private industry to rise up to help out.,0,0,True,"step 1: the premise describes a scenario where private industry could potentially take over mail collection, processing, and delivery for the postal service. this implies that private industry has the capability to perform these tasks. step 2: the hypothesis states that it is not possible for private industry to help out. this contradicts the premise, as the premise suggests that it is indeed possible. step 3: based on the given information, the hypothesis is not entailed by the premise and is a contradictory statement."
3682,"Conversely, the Congress might separate out some of these functions.",Congress might combine some of those functions.,0,0,True,"step 1: the premise suggests that the congress has the ability to separate out certain functions, indicating a potential division of duties. however, it does not imply that the congress cannot also combine functions. the hypothesis proposes the opposite action - combining functions.step 2: the hypothesis does not directly contradict the premise, but rather offers an alternative possibility. it is possible for the congress to both separate and combine functions, depending on their decision.step 3: entailment is a strong logical relationship where the hypothesis follows necessarily from the premise. in this case, the hypothesis is not entailed by the premise, as the premise does not preclude the hypothesis but instead leaves it as a possibility.step 4: based on the given information and logical principles, the hypothesis cannot be logically inferred from the premise as it presents an alternative scenario."
3683,yeah it's pretty funny,I found it very dull and too serious.,0,0,True,"step 1: the premise is a subjective statement expressing amusement or humor. it does not provide any factual or logical information that can be directly linked to the hypothesis. step 2: the hypothesis is also a subjective statement expressing a lack of amusement and a perception of seriousness. since subjective experiences and perceptions cannot be logically inferred from one another, the hypothesis cannot be logically inferred from the premise. step 3: the fact that two statements express opposing subjective opinions does not allow for logical entailment."
3684,"Ticket offices (billeteries) at FNAC or Virgin Megastore, both on the Champs-Elysees, will show what groups are in town.","After visiting the Virgin Megastore, head next door for some of the best croissants in Paris.",1,0,False,"step 1. in the premise, it is stated that ticket offices at fnac and virgin megastore on the champs-elysees can provide information about groups in town. this implies that these ticket offices serve as sources of local information. step 2. the hypothesis suggests visiting the virgin megastore and then going next door for some of the best croissants in paris. while there is no logical connection between the premise and hypothesis, it is a valid recommendation based on common knowledge that the champs-elysees area, including the vicinity of virgin megastore, is known for excellent croissants. step 3. the hypothesis cannot be logically inferred from the premise as they address different aspects of the situation. however, the hypothesis is a reasonable suggestion based on common knowledge."
3685,comprehensively improve grantees' delivery of services to clients.,Services always have to be delivered in exactly the same way.,0,0,True,"step 1: in the premise, 'comprehensively improve grantees' delivery of services to clients' suggests an initiative to enhance the quality, efficiency, or effectiveness of how grantees deliver services to their clients. this improvement could involve various changes, but it does not necessarily imply a one-size-fits-all approach. step 2: the hypothesis, 'services always have to be delivered in exactly the same way,' is a strict requirement that contradicts the concept of improvement. the premise does not suggest or imply that services must be delivered in an identical manner at all times. step 3: based on the logical analysis, the hypothesis cannot be inferred from the premise, as it contradicts the flexibility and adaptability inherent in the idea of improving services."
3686,"expected to be a normal profit level, with the understanding that unusually efficient firms might achieve supra-normal profits for a time.","Nobody ever expects that any firms will be at a normal profit level, as they always assume above and beyond what is possible.",0,0,True,"step 1: in the premise, it is stated that profit levels are generally expected to be normal, but acknowledges the possibility of firms achieving supra-normal profits temporarily. this implies an understanding that firms can, and sometimes do, exceed normal profit levels. step 2: the hypothesis suggests a belief that no firms will ever be at a normal profit level, and that above-normal profits are always assumed. this contradicts the premise, as the premise acknowledges that firms can and do achieve normal profit levels. step 3: based on the information provided, the hypothesis cannot be logically inferred from the premise, as they are in contradiction."
3687,girl with helmet riding a brown horse,The girl is riding in the go kart,0,0,True,"step 1: analyzing the premise, it describes a girl riding a brown horse. this involves a human riding an animal, typically associated with horseback riding. there's no information about a go kart in the premise.step 2: analyzing the hypothesis, it suggests an entirely different situation where a girl is riding a go kart. go karts are small, wheeled vehicles often used for recreational activities. they are not described or indicated in the premise.step 3: based on the given information, the hypothesis cannot be logically inferred from the premise as they describe different situations involving different objects."
3688,Case studies can determine the effects of programs and reasons for success (or failures).,Case studies can show what happens when a program succeeds.,1,1,True,"step 1: in the premise, case studies are identified as a means to determine the effects of programs and reasons for their success or failures. this implies that case studies provide insight into the outcomes and underlying causes of program implementation. step 2: the hypothesis suggests that case studies can 'show what happens when a program succeeds.' this is an accurate and logical implication of the premise, as case studies can certainly reveal the specifics of successful program implementations. step 3: therefore, based on the logical connection between the premise and hypothesis, and the common-sense understanding that case studies can indeed provide detailed information about successful programs, the hypothesis is a logical entailment of the premise."
3689,I think I almost hypnotized myself.,I am certain I had hypnotized myself.,0,0,True,"step 1: the premise indicates that the speaker has a belief or suspicion about having hypnotized themselves. they use the term 'almost' to qualify their statement, suggesting that they are not entirely sure. step 2: the hypothesis expresses a stronger degree of certainty than the premise, stating 'i am certain'. however, it is important to note that the hypothesis does not contradict the premise, as the speaker's level of certainty can increase over time, especially if they perceive additional evidence or signs supporting their initial belief. step 3: while the hypothesis is not logically entailed by the premise, it is a reasonable inference given the context, as an increase in certainty is a natural progression from a suspicion or belief."
3690,The Initial Regulatory Flexibility Analysis did not discuss any significant alternatives minimizing the impact on small entities., The Initial Regulatory Flexibility Analysis provided several significant alternatives. ,0,0,True,"step 1: the premise states that the initial regulatory flexibility analysis did not discuss any significant alternatives minimizing the impact on small entities. this implies that the analysis did not explore potential ways to lessen the regulatory burden on small entities. step 2: the hypothesis suggests that the initial regulatory flexibility analysis provided several significant alternatives. this directly contradicts the premise, as the presence of alternatives would mean that the analysis did discuss ways to minimize the impact. however, it is important to note that the absence of alternatives in the analysis does not necessarily mean that no alternatives exist in reality. step 3: based on the given information, the hypothesis cannot be logically inferred from the premise. the premise and hypothesis present conflicting statements, and the hypothesis cannot be reasonably derived from the premise."
3691,Bill Gates wrote in The Road Ahead about the need for a dialogue on the information highway.,Bill Gates never wrote The Road Ahead.,0,0,True,"step 1: in the premise, bill gates is identified as the author of the book 'the road ahead'. this is a factual statement. step 2: the hypothesis contradicts the premise by stating that bill gates did not write the road ahead. contradictory hypotheses cannot be logically inferred from their contradictory premises. step 3: based on the logical inconsistency between the premise and hypothesis, the hypothesis cannot be inferred from the premise."
3692,Indicators are grouped by topic and summarized by theme.,Indicators are divided into 12 separate groups.,1,0,False,"step 1: in the premise, indicators are described as being grouped by topic. this means that there is a categorization or organization of indicators based on a shared characteristic or theme. however, the number of groups is not explicitly stated. step 2: the hypothesis suggests that there are 12 separate groups of indicators. this is a specific number and a different way of describing the grouping compared to the premise. step 3: while the hypothesis can imply some form of grouping, it does not directly follow from the premise. the premise only establishes that indicators are grouped and summarized, but it does not specify an exact number of groups. based on the information provided, the hypothesis is not logically entailed by the premise."
3693,"In reporting on deficiencies in internal control, auditors should identify those that are individually or in the aggregate considered to be material weaknesses.",Auditors do not need to report on material weaknesses.,0,0,True,"step 1: in the premise, it is stated that auditors should identify material weaknesses in internal control for reporting. this implies that material weaknesses are significant enough to require reporting. step 2: the hypothesis, however, suggests that auditors do not need to report on material weaknesses. this directly contradicts the information in the premise. step 3: based on the logical contradiction between the premise and hypothesis, the hypothesis is not entailed by the premise and cannot be logically inferred from it."
3694,The lot upon which it is being built had been vacant.,"The lot had been vacant, said the manager.",1,1,True,"step 1: in the premise, it is stated that 'the lot upon which it is being built had been vacant'. this means that at some point in the past, the lot was not being used for any construction or occupancy. the manager's statement in the hypothesis is identical to the premise in terms of content.step 2: the hypothesis 'the lot had been vacant, said the manager' is logically equivalent to the premise. the relationship between the two is that of identity. the hypothesis is not inferred from the premise but is the premise itself.step 3: since the hypothesis is identical to the premise, it can be considered an entailed consequence of the premise. the hypothesis is a restatement of the premise, and as such, it follows logically from the premise.step 4: given the logical equivalence of the hypothesis and the premise, the hypothesis is entailed by the premise with a label of 1."
3695,"Yes, and from the enormous risk he ran we can see how fully he realized its importance. ",He was willing to accept the potential consequences of the risk he took. ,1,1,True,"step 1: in the premise, it is stated that the person took an enormous risk, and that the risk's importance was fully realized by him. this implies that he was aware of the potential consequences of his actions and understood the significance of what he was doing.step 2: the hypothesis, 'he was willing to accept the potential consequences of the risk he took,' is a reasonable inference from the premise. realizing the importance of a risk implies an acknowledgement of the potential consequences, and being willing to accept those consequences is a logical next step.step 3: based on the given information and logical reasoning, the hypothesis can be inferred from the premise."
3696,and they don't allow uh any sweat any sweat shirts or t shirts that might have vulgar or you know anything like that on it but,"There are children around, so vulgarness shouldn't be on clothes. ",1,1,True,"step 1: in the premise, it is stated that a specific dress code is enforced in a certain environment, disallowing sweatshirts and t-shirts with vulgar content. step 2: the hypothesis suggests a reason for this dress code - the presence of children. the hypothesis implies that having children around warrants keeping clothes free of vulgar content. step 3: the hypothesis can be logically inferred from the premise because the premise and hypothesis describe the same situation and share the common element of the need to avoid vulgarity in clothing due to the presence of children. both the premise and hypothesis are based on the idea that children should not be exposed to vulgar content. therefore, the hypothesis is a logical consequence of the premise."
3697,The best introduction to the Tuscan hill country is a tour of the famous vineyards that grace its southern-oriented slopes.,There is no way of visiting the Tucson hill.,0,0,True,"step 1: in the premise, it states that the best way to introduce oneself to the tuscan hill country is by touring the famous vineyards located on its southern slopes. this implies that the tuscan hill country is known for its vineyards and that visiting these vineyards is a recommended way to learn about and experience the area.step 2: the hypothesis is a negation, stating that 'there is no way of visiting the tucson hill'. however, the premise does not mention anything about the tucson hill, and it specifically refers to the tuscan hill country. the hypothesis is not logically related to the premise.step 3: based on the given information, the hypothesis cannot be inferred from the premise, as they address different subjects."
3698,yes that i think that's true so that makes them feel definitely like outsiders but like getting back to the their government benefits they they do have a lot of uh tax benefits,"They definitely feel included, but they don't have any tax benefits. ",0,0,True,"step 1. the premise describes a situation where 'they' (the identity of 'they' is not explicitly stated) feel like outsiders due to certain circumstances, but they still have government benefits and tax benefits. step 2. the hypothesis suggests a contradictory situation where 'they' feel included, but they don't have tax benefits. step 3. the hypothesis cannot be logically inferred from the premise, as the premise states that 'they' indeed do have tax benefits. therefore, the hypothesis contradicts the premise."
3699,"The heat from those fragments cut through the chill in the air, and the glow furnished light for most of the camp.",The night was quite warm in contrast to the fragments.,0,0,True,"step 1: in the premise, the heat from the fragments warms up the night, making it less chilly. however, the phrase 'in contrast to the fragments' in the hypothesis suggests a contrasting condition or situation. step 2: the hypothesis 'the night was quite warm in contrast to the fragments' does not logically follow from the premise. while the premise states that the night is not as chilly due to the heat from the fragments, it does not assert that the night is warm in an absolute sense or that it is warmer than the fragments. step 3: based on the information provided in the premise and hypothesis, the hypothesis is not entailed by the premise."
3700,How it is formulated has understandably been a longstanding interest of the Congress.,Congress was only interested in its application.,0,1,False,"step 1: in the premise, the interest of the congress is described as 'how it is formulated,' which suggests a focus on the process or structure of a particular matter. this could encompass a broad range of motivations, including practical concerns, policy goals, or ideological beliefs.step 2: in the hypothesis, the interest of the congress is described as 'its application.' this is a more narrow focus, suggesting an interest in the practical use or implementation of the matter in question.step 3: while the premise and hypothesis describe different aspects of congress's interest, they are not mutually exclusive. a focus on 'how it is formulated' could naturally lead to an interest in 'its application.' for example, understanding the formulation of a law may be necessary to effectively apply it. therefore, the hypothesis can be seen as a logical consequence of the premise.step 4: it is also worth noting that the premise and hypothesis do not contradict each other, and no known facts suggest otherwise.step 5: based on the logical reasoning and lack of contradictory facts, the hypothesis can be inferred from the premise."
3701,The man smiled.,The person was happy they had won. ,1,0,False,"step 1: a man smiling is a common sign of happiness or contentment. however, there are other reasons for smiling such as telling a joke or seeing a friend. the premise does not provide any additional context to rule out these possibilities. step 2: the hypothesis suggests that the man was happy 'they had won'. there is no explicit connection between the man in the premise and a win or competition. step 3: based on the information provided, the hypothesis cannot be logically inferred from the premise as there is no direct evidence of a win or competition in the premise."
3702,"Following the CEOas lead, members of the senior executive team learn to value the advice of the CIO in setting business directions and developing strategies for improving organizational capabilities and competitiveness.",Most of the CIOs ideas are bad and will harm the company.,1,0,False,"step 1: in the premise, it is stated that the ceo and the senior executive team value the advice of the cio in setting business directions and developing strategies for improving organizational capabilities and competitiveness. this indicates a positive relationship between the cio and the executive team.step 2: contradictorily, the hypothesis suggests that most of the cio's ideas are bad and will harm the company. this is a direct contradiction to the information given in the premise.step 3: based on the given information, the hypothesis cannot be logically inferred from the premise as it contradicts the premise's content.step 4: a hypothesis that contradicts the premise is not a valid logical inference."
3704,We are free to fall in love with the entire country and invariably  it's a glorious lifelong love affair.,Lifelong love affairs are always with the entire country.,1,1,True,"step 1: in the premise, the expression 'invariably it's a glorious lifelong love affair' implies that when someone falls in love with a country, it is a lifelong commitment. the phrase 'the entire country' in the premise indicates that the person's love and commitment extend to every aspect or part of the country.step 2: the hypothesis states that 'lifelong love affairs are always with the entire country'. it has the same meaning as the premise, as both express the idea that when someone falls in love with a country, their love is not limited to a particular aspect or part of it, but encompasses the entire country.step 3: the hypothesis is a generalization of the premise. since the premise is descriptive of a specific case, the hypothesis, which is a statement about all cases, can be logically inferred from the premise.step 4: common sense also supports this inference, as a lifelong love affair implies a deep connection and commitment to the object of one's love, which extends to all aspects of that object in most cases.step 5: in conclusion, the hypothesis is entailed by the premise because it is a logical consequence of the premise's meaning."
3705,"To my surprise, the hat didn't seem to be following me... ...The hat was in front of me.",The hat was teleported from behind me to be ahead of me.,1,0,False,"step 1: the premise describes a situation where the speaker was expecting the hat to be following them but instead found it in front of them. this implies that the hat's location changed unexpectedly for the speaker. the hypothesis suggests that the hat was teleported from behind the speaker to be in front of them. step 2: the hypothesis contradicts the premise as the premise states that the hat was not following the speaker and was in front of them, while the hypothesis asserts that the hat was teleported to be in front of the speaker from a different location. teleportation is an action that is not mentioned or implied in the premise. step 3: based on the information provided in the premise and the logical principle that the hypothesis contradicts the premise, the hypothesis cannot be inferred from the premise."
3706,"Not just beautiful, it is a good place for those who enjoy a gentle stroll, popular with families and visitors with disabilities.",It has no access for disabled people and few disabled visitors.,0,0,True,"step 1: in the premise, the place is described as 'popular with families and visitors with disabilities.' this implies that the place is accessible and welcoming to disabled people. step 2: the hypothesis, however, states that 'it has no access for disabled people and few disabled visitors.' this contradicts the premise. if a place is popular with disabled visitors, it is unlikely that there is no access or few disabled visitors. step 3: based on the given information and logical reasoning, the hypothesis is not entailed by the premise as it contradicts it."
3707,Dr. Sloper (Finney) and Catherine Sloper (Leigh) in Washington Square (63 seconds) :,Dr Sloper is not in Washington Square.,0,0,True,"step 1. the premise describes a specific location (washington square) and the presence of two individuals, dr. sloper and catherine sloper. there are no indications of dr. sloper leaving or being absent from the scene. step 2. the hypothesis states that dr. sloper is not in washington square, which directly contradicts the information provided in the premise. step 3. based on the logical negation of the presence of dr. sloper in washington square as stated in the hypothesis, it is not logically entailed by the premise. in fact, it contradicts the premise."
3708,In 1826 Richard Barrett won a800 in a competition when the house's entryway was selected as the best mile of macadam road in Jamaica.,Entryway to Richard Barrett's house was nothing special.,0,0,True,"step 1: in the premise, it is stated that richard barrett won 800 pounds in a competition because the entryway of his house was selected as the best mile of macadam road in jamaica. this indicates that the entryway was considered exceptional and won an award.step 2: the hypothesis, 'entryway to richard barrett's house was nothing special', contradicts the premise. if the entryway was nothing special, it would not have won the competition.step 3: based on the logical negation of the premise and the given information, the hypothesis cannot be inferred from the premise."
3709,"The effect of the restriction, however, is to prohibit advice or argumentation that existing welfare laws are unconstitutional or unlawful.",The restriction forces a fine on those who state welfare is unlawful.,1,1,True,"step 1: in the premise, it is stated that the effect of the restriction is to prohibit advice or argumentation that welfare laws are unconstitutional or unlawful. this implies that expressing such views is not allowed.step 2: the hypothesis suggests that a fine is imposed on individuals who state that welfare is unlawful. this is a logical extension of the premise, as one possible means of enforcing the prohibition could be through fines or penalties. common sense and logical reasoning suggest that if expressing the view that welfare laws are unlawful is prohibited, then it stands to reason that there would be some form of consequence for violating this restriction.step 3: based on the logical connection between the premise and hypothesis, and the lack of contradictory information, the hypothesis can be inferred from the premise."
3710,"The Vagina Monologues (Hammerstein Ballroom, New York City).",The Vagina Monologues are very popular.,1,1,True,"step 1. the premise identifies a specific instance of a performance art piece called 'the vagina monologues' taking place at hammerstein ballroom in new york city. popularity is not explicitly stated in the premise, but it is a common association with 'the vagina monologues'. step 2. the hypothesis asserts that 'the vagina monologues' are very popular. this can be inferred from the premise as the selection of hammerstein ballroom as the venue suggests a large and well-attended event. the 'vagina monologues' is known to be a popular and controversial piece, which often attracts large audiences. step 3. based on the logical reasoning, common sense, and known associations with the 'vagina monologues', the hypothesis can be inferred from the premise."
3711,"It is signed, in Greek letters, Domenikos Theotokopoulos, the artist's real name.",It was signed in hieroglyphics.,0,0,True,"step 1: analyzing the premise, the artist domenikos theotokopoulos signed the work using greek letters. this is a factual detail, and there is no logical connection or implication of any other signing methods. step 2: the hypothesis suggests that the signing was done using hieroglyphics, but there is no information in the premise to support this claim. in fact, greek letters and hieroglyphics are distinct writing systems, unrelated to each other. step 3: based on the information provided, there is no logical connection or implication from the premise to the hypothesis. therefore, the hypothesis cannot be inferred from the premise. "
3712,Toddler walking along path.,toddler is asleep,0,0,True,"step 1: in the premise, 'toddler walking along path' describes a scene where a toddler is moving along a path. this information does not provide any details about the toddler's current state, such as being awake or asleep. common sense and factual knowledge do not contradict the hypothesis since a toddler can be walking while asleep in certain situations, like being carried in a stroller or being carried by an adult. however, the premise alone does not provide sufficient evidence to logically infer the hypothesis.step 2: the hypothesis 'toddler is asleep' contradicts the information in the premise because the premise states that the toddler is walking. these two statements cannot both be true at the same time.step 3: based on the logical analysis, the hypothesis 'toddler is asleep' is not entailed by the premise 'toddler walking along path'. the premise does not contain enough information to logically infer the hypothesis."
3713,She wore a simple canvas shift and she was desperately thin.,She wore an elaborate gown but was thin.,0,0,True,"step 1: the premise describes the woman's clothing as 'simple canvas shift' and her body condition as 'desperately thin'. there is no logical connection or inconsistency between these pieces of information. common sense suggests that wearing a simple shift does not prevent someone from being thin. step 2: the hypothesis introduces a contrast between the woman's clothing being 'elaborate' and her body condition being 'thin'. however, the premise does not mention anything about the woman's clothing being 'elaborate' or 'simple' in relation to her thinness. therefore, the hypothesis cannot be logically inferred from the premise as given. step 3: based on the logical analysis, the hypothesis is not entailed by the premise."
3714,"He, Thorn, and the Kal went to the smithy.","Thorn, the Kal and himself were cousins. ",1,0,False,"step 1: in the premise, 'he', 'thorn', and 'the kal' are mentioned as going to the smithy. this information does not provide any logical connection or relationship between 'he', 'thorn', and 'the kal'. common sense or factual knowledge does not directly provide enough information to determine if 'thorn' and 'the kal' are related to 'he' or to each other.step 2: the hypothesis 'thorn, the kal and himself were cousins' is not logically inferred from the premise. the premise does not provide any information about family relationships between 'he', 'thorn', and 'the kal'.step 3: based on the given information, the hypothesis 'thorn, the kal and himself were cousins' cannot be logically inferred from the premise."
3715,A man wearing large snowshoes runs inside of a seemingly crowded ski resort.,A man is running.,1,1,True,"step 1: in the premise, the man is identified as running inside a ski resort while wearing large snowshoes. the action 'running' is a clear and distinct behavior. the setting, a ski resort, does not contradict this information. step 2: the hypothesis 'a man is running' directly matches the identified behavior in the premise. step 3: based on the logical reasoning, the man's behavior in the premise is sufficient to logically infer 'a man is running', as stated in the hypothesis."
3716,"Cultural transitions of major organizations are never easy to accomplish, and I would certainly not claim that it will be easy for GAO.",It's always easy for major organizations to complete cultural transitions.,0,0,True,"step 1: in the premise, it is stated that cultural transitions for major organizations are challenging and that gao's transition will not be an exception. this implies that cultural transitions require significant effort and resources. step 2: the hypothesis directly contradicts the premise by claiming that cultural transitions are 'always easy' for major organizations. based on the information provided, this is not a logical inference from the premise. step 3: given the clear contradiction between the two statements, the hypothesis cannot be inferred from the premise."
3717,Bad idea!,The worst idea anyone has come up with yet.,1,0,False,"step 1: in the premise, the speaker expresses their disapproval of an idea using the term 'bad idea'. this indicates that the idea in question is not good or suitable for some reason. the hypothesis goes further by labeling this idea as 'the worst idea anyone has come up with yet'. while the premise does not specify which idea among all ideas is being referred to, it does not contradict the hypothesis.step 2: the hypothesis is a more specific and stronger version of the premise. it implies that the idea mentioned in the premise is not just bad, but the absolute worst anyone has ever had. however, the premise does not provide enough information to determine this definitively.step 3: based on the lack of contradiction and the possibility that the idea mentioned in the premise could indeed be the worst one ever, the hypothesis could be inferred from the premise with a degree of uncertainty. however, the hypothesis is a more definitive statement, making it less likely to be logically inferred from the premise alone."
3718,"Copper and bronze were worked and re-exported, along with high quality foodstuffs such as olive oil, honey and wine.","High quality foodstuffs like honey, oil, and wine had to be imported. ",0,0,True,"step 1: in the premise, high quality foodstuffs such as olive oil, honey, and wine are mentioned as being worked and re-exported. this implies that these items were produced in one location and then traded or transported to another. step 2: the hypothesis suggests that these same foodstuffs had to be imported, which contradicts the information in the premise. however, it is essential to understand the nuance of the words 'worked and re-exported'. it can mean that these items were produced locally and then traded or exported, or it could mean that they were obtained through trade or import and then re-exported. step 3: the premise does not explicitly state where these foodstuffs were originally sourced. it is possible, though not explicitly stated, that they were imported initially and then re-exported. therefore, based on the available information, the hypothesis cannot be definitively ruled out as being entailed by the premise."
3719,"Named after the city gentleman and infamous burglar, it is one of the best-known pubs in the city.",The pub was named after a British Prime Minister.,0,0,True,"step 1: in the premise, the pub is named after two individuals - a city gentleman and an infamous burglar. this information does not directly relate to any british prime minister. step 2: the hypothesis suggests a different origin for the name of the pub, which contradicts the information in the premise. the hypothesis cannot be logically inferred from the premise. step 3: based on the information provided, the hypothesis is not entailed by the premise."
3720,uh why is it so sacred to have it on Tuesday and uh why couldn't it be Friday and Saturday i don't know what the ideal day is if you're trying to catch a weekend or maybe just Tuesday and Wednesday i'll bet you'd get a lot more people i think the news media has really they jump in there and they uh tell you the the that who won before seven thirty and before the elections before the polls are closed,Why is it so sacred to have it on Friday?,0,0,True,"step 1. in the premise, the speaker expresses confusion about the ideal day for elections, suggesting tuesday and wednesday as alternatives. they also mention the influence of news media reporting election results before polls are closed on those days. no reason is given for why friday is being questioned in the hypothesis.step 2. the hypothesis asks for the significance of fridays for elections, but it does not follow logically from the premise. the premise does not provide enough context to imply that fridays are being considered as an alternative day for elections or that there is any particular reason why fridays might be 'sacred'.step 3. based on the given information, the hypothesis cannot be logically inferred from the premise. the hypothesis introduces a new topic and requires additional context or information to be evaluated in relation to the premise."
3721,uh-huh oh is that true now now we're we're in Texas now and you're in Texas right,What a coincidence that you are in Texas.,1,1,True,"step 1: in the premise, the speaker (you) and the listener (i) are established to be in texas. the hypothesis expresses a sense of surprise or coincidence about this shared location. step 2: the hypothesis can be logically inferred from the premise because the premise sets the context that we are both in texas, and the hypothesis acknowledges and reacts to this shared context. step 3: based on the logical connection between the premise and hypothesis, and the lack of contradictory information, the hypothesis is a logical entailment of the premise.step 4: it is important to note that this logical analysis assumes that the context and dialogue presented in the premise are accurate and complete. in real-world conversations, additional information or clarification may be necessary to determine the validity of an inference."
3722,and and and uh one day they'll pick up uh the the cleaning people come through and they'll pick up recycled paper and then the next day they'll pick up the other so,One day the janitors will come and pick up the paper.,1,1,True,"step 1: in the premise, it is stated that 'one day they'll pick up recycled paper' and 'the next day they'll pick up the other'. this implies that the cleaning people perform this task on different days. the hypothesis, 'one day the janitors will come and pick up the paper', is a logical consequence of the information provided in the premise. it follows that the cleaning people, referred to as 'janitors' in the hypothesis, can logically pick up the paper as described in the premise.step 2: the hypothesis can be inferred from the premise, as the premise establishes that the cleaning people pick up the recycled paper and the hypothesis states that they will come and pick up the paper.step 3: based on the logical connection between the premise and hypothesis, and the lack of contradictory information, the hypothesis can be inferred from the premise."
3723,"However, for anyone who has a few days to spare for a first glimpse, we suggest some highlights representative of its many the capital Palermo, the ancient Greek settlements, and the pretty coastal resort of Taormina.","One should steer clear from Palermo, Taormina, and the Greek settlements during their vacation. ",0,0,True,"step 1: in the premise, the suggestion is made to visit palermo, taormina, and the greek settlements during a vacation in sicily. no negative information about these places is mentioned. step 2: the hypothesis suggests avoiding these very same places during a vacation. this directly contradicts the recommendation in the premise. step 3: based on the logical negation of the information in the premise, the hypothesis cannot be inferred from it. step 1: the hypothesis presents a negative statement about visiting palermo, taormina, and the greek settlements during a vacation. the premise, on the other hand, positively suggests visiting these places as highlights. step 2: the hypothesis contradicts the premise, as it suggests not doing something (avoiding these places) that the premise suggests doing (visiting them). step 3: given the contradiction between the premise and hypothesis, the hypothesis cannot be logically inferred from the premise. negating a positive statement does not lead to the same negative statement without additional context or justification."
3724,"Colonnaded public buildings, iron balconies, winding streets, flagstoned squares and the many churches all speak of the Portuguese inheritance as well as the Chinese, a fusion of East and West that has produced the unique Macanese culture.",The Macanese culture had mainly been influenced by the Portuguese history.,1,1,True,"step 1: the premise describes various elements that make up the macanese culture, specifically mentioning portuguese influence through architectural structures and religious institutions. this suggests a significant historical connection between the macanese culture and portugal. step 2: the hypothesis directly states that the macanese culture has mainly been influenced by portuguese history. given that the premise already establishes this connection, the hypothesis is a logical consequence and a more specific statement about the influence mentioned in the premise. step 3: based on the logical connection between the premise and hypothesis, and the lack of contradictory information, the hypothesis can be inferred from the premise."
3725,I blinked.,I had something in my eyes that caused them to close. ,1,1,True,"step 1: blinking is a reflexive action that closes the eyes momentarily to protect them from potential harm or irritants. the premise 'i blinked' simply indicates this action. step 2: the hypothesis 'i had something in my eyes that caused them to close' is a common explanation for why someone might blink. in fact, the reflexive blinking action is often a response to having something in the eyes that needs to be removed. step 3: therefore, the hypothesis 'i had something in my eyes that caused them to close' can be logically inferred from the premise 'i blinked'. this inference is based on the logical connection between blinking as a response to an irritant and the common-sense understanding of why someone might blink.step 3: based on the logical reasoning and common-sense understanding, the hypothesis 'i had something in my eyes that caused them to close' is entailed by the premise 'i blinked'."
3726,uh well i was i was in a uh private consulting firm so um and uh and uh anyway um right now i'm i'm not i'm not there but  but anyway,I was fired from a private consulting firm. ,1,0,False,"step 1: the premise describes that the speaker was once employed in a private consulting firm but is no longer working there. this information does not necessarily imply that the speaker was fired, as there could be various reasons for leaving a job, such as retirement, resignation, or relocation. however, it is commonsense understanding that one possibility for no longer working at a place is being fired. step 2: the hypothesis suggests that the speaker was fired from the private consulting firm, which is a specific instance of no longer working there. if the premise is true, then the hypothesis could be a possible explanation for the speaker's current employment status. step 3: based on the premise's ambiguous nature and the possibility that the speaker was indeed fired, the hypothesis cannot be definitively ruled out or proven to be entailed by the premise, as there is insufficient information to make a definitive conclusion. step 4: however, since the premise does not necessarily entail the hypothesis but the hypothesis is a possibility given the information in the premise, we label it as 0 for no entailment."
3727,Kids are reintroducing prayer to public schools.,Kids may be taught by their parents to pray in school.,1,1,True,"step 1: in the premise, 'kids are reintroducing prayer to public schools', the action 'reintroducing prayer' implies that kids are actively advocating or engaging in prayer in a public school setting. this does not necessarily mean that the schools are officially endorsing or instructing prayer, but rather that kids are bringing prayer into the school environment.step 2: the hypothesis 'kids may be taught by their parents to pray in school' proposes a possible reason for why kids might be praying in school. this is a reasonable inference from the premise, as it is a common occurrence for parents to teach their children about prayer and religious practices, including encouraging them to pray in various settings. this does not contradict the premise, as the premise only indicates that kids are praying in schools, it does not specify the source of their prayer.step 3: based on the logical reasoning, common sense, and the lack of contradictory information, the hypothesis is a possible and reasonable inference from the premise."
3728,"In addition, LSC has begun conducting a thorough review of LSC's regulations.",The current regulations were determined to be fine and no review was necessary.,0,0,True,"step 1: in the premise, it is stated that lsc has begun conducting a thorough review of lsc's regulations. this implies that there is a current set of regulations in place and that lsc has identified a need for review. no information is provided in the premise that would suggest the regulations were already found to be 'fine' and no review was necessary. step 2: the hypothesis, 'the current regulations were determined to be fine and no review was necessary', contradicts the information in the premise. the premise indicates that a review is taking place, which is inconsistent with the hypothesis that no review was necessary. step 3: based on the logical contradiction between the premise and hypothesis, the hypothesis cannot be inferred from the premise."
3729,But Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat told U.S. officials that negotiation was impossible as long as the construction continued.,"Arafat told US officials that as long as construction continued, he would negotiate",0,0,True,"step 1: the premise indicates that palestinian leader yasser arafat communicated to u.s. officials that negotiation was impossible under the condition of continued construction. this statement implies that arafat believed the construction was an obstacle to negotiations. step 2: the hypothesis suggests that arafat would have negotiated had the construction not continued. this contradicts the premise as it implies an opposite outcome. step 3: based on the logical analysis, there is no entailment between the premise and hypothesis. the hypothesis cannot be logically inferred from the premise as it suggests a different outcome."
3730,Its main campus features some of the earliest examples of collegiate gothic architecture in North America.,Its main campus is a historic district and features some of the earliest examples of collegiate gothic architecture in North America.,1,1,True,"step 1: the premise states that the main campus of an institution features some of the earliest examples of collegiate gothic architecture in north america. collegiate gothic architecture is a distinctive style of architecture with specific historical and architectural characteristics. step 2: the hypothesis states that the main campus is a historic district and features some of the earliest examples of collegiate gothic architecture in north america. the second part of the hypothesis is identical to the premise, ensuring it is logically entailed. step 3: the hypothesis is a more detailed and expansive version of the premise, as it includes the additional information that the main campus is a historic district. however, since this extra detail does not contradict the premise and is a reasonable extension of it, the hypothesis can still be inferred from the premise. step 4: based on the logical consistency of the hypothesis with the premise and the fact that the hypothesis is a more detailed version of the premise, the hypothesis is entailed by the premise."
3731,then with uh uh the defense with Bruce Smith Bruce Smith there at linebacker there they've got a very well rounded team and it seems that they've gotten over their bickering and their fighting as they problems they had in the past and now they're uh really playing as a good good together as a team,The team used to have too many problems to perform competently. ,1,1,True,"step 1: in the premise, it is mentioned that the team, specifically the defense, had 'bickering and their fighting as problems they had in the past'. this implies that the team was not functioning effectively due to internal conflicts. step 2: the hypothesis states that 'the team used to have too many problems to perform competently'. this is a logical implication of the premise as the problems mentioned in the premise would indeed hinder the team's performance. the hypothesis can be seen as a description of the state of the team before they resolved their issues. step 3: based on the logical relationship between the premise and hypothesis, the hypothesis can be inferred from the premise."
3732,well budgeting is a sore subject in this family,"We've tried budgeting, and it's only caused a lot of drama.",1,1,True,"step 1: in the premise, 'well budgeting is a sore subject in this family' suggests that discussing or implementing a budget is a sensitive issue that causes distress or disagreement. this could be due to various reasons such as past experiences, differing financial priorities, or lack of financial literacy. step 2: in the hypothesis, 'we've tried budgeting, and it's only caused a lot of drama' explicitly states that an attempt to budget has resulted in disputes or negative emotions. this is consistent with the premise as it also implies that budgeting is a challenging issue for this family. step 3: the hypothesis can be logically inferred from the premise since the hypothesis describes a specific instance of the broader issue mentioned in the premise. in other words, the hypothesis provides additional information about the 'sore subject' of budgeting in this family, and it does not contradict the premise. step 4: based on the logical relationship between the premise and hypothesis, and the lack of contradictory information, the hypothesis can be inferred from the premise."
3733,"Soaring above it all is a 73-m (239-ft) high minaret, with a graceful balcony from which the muezzin calls the faithful to prayer.",There is a large minaret precariously perched above it.,1,0,False,"step 1: in the premise, we have a description of a minaret that is 73-m (239-ft) high and has a balcony from which the muezzin calls to prayer. this minaret is depicted as being 'soaring above it all' and 'gracefully' positioned. no contradictory information is provided. step 2: the hypothesis suggests a minaret that is 'precarly perched' above something, implying instability or uncertainty in its position. while the words 'soaring' and 'gracefully' in the premise do not directly contradict 'precarly perched', they do not logically imply it. however, neither do they contradict it. step 3: the hypothesis 'there is a large minaret precariously perched above it' is not logically entailed by the premise 'soaring above it all is a 73-m (239-ft) high minaret, with a graceful balcony from which the muezzin calls the faithful to prayer'. the hypothesis provides additional information not implied in the premise."
3734,"Since these are acute mortalities, it is assumed that there is no lag between reduced exposure and reduced risk of mortality.",Whether or not there is a lag between reduced exposure and reduced risk of mortality is beyond the scope of this report.,1,0,False,"step 1: in the premise, it is stated that these are acute mortalities and there is no lag between reduced exposure and reduced risk of mortality. this means that the risk of mortality directly correlates with the exposure level, and there is no delay between the decrease in exposure and the decrease in risk. common sense and facts support this, as acute mortalities refer to deaths that occur suddenly and without a long-term illness or condition. step 2: in contrast, the hypothesis states that the existence or non-existence of a lag between reduced exposure and reduced risk of mortality is not within the scope of the report. this does not directly relate to or contradict the premise, as the premise is making a statement about the given situation, while the hypothesis is about the focus of the report. step 3: based on the logical analysis, the hypothesis is not entailed by the premise as they address different aspects. the premise describes the given situation and the fact that there is no lag in acute mortalities, while the hypothesis talks about the focus of the report. therefore, the hypothesis cannot be logically inferred from the premise."
3735,"These bizarre establishments are the true home of the $20 glass of beer, with prices aimed squarely at lonely executives with expense accounts looking for a home away from home. )",The high prices are directed towards CEO's who can easily afford the expensive beers.,1,1,True,"step 1. in the premise, it is stated that these establishments have high prices, aimed at lonely executives with expense accounts. the context suggests that these prices are unusually high. step 2. the hypothesis states that the high prices are directed towards ceos. this is a specific type of executive. step 3. the information in the premise implies that the target customers are executives with expense accounts, suggesting they have a higher income level than the average person. given the context, it is reasonable to infer that ceos, as a subset of executives, would be among the customers who can afford the high prices. therefore, the hypothesis can be logically inferred from the premise. step 4. it is common sense that high-end establishments often target customers with significant disposable income. in this case, the hypothesis fits with the information in the premise and the common-sense understanding of such business practices."
3736,"a large house with three stories and 3 matching balconies, with one person standing on each balcony overlooking onlookers.",The house is single storied.,0,0,True,"step 1: in the premise, a large house with three stories and three balconies is described, with one person standing on each balcony overlooking onlookers. the information provided indicates a multi-story house, which is inconsistent with a single-storied house.step 2: the hypothesis contradicts the information given in the premise, as a single-storied house cannot have multiple stories and balconies as described.step 3: based on the given information, the hypothesis is not logically entailed by the premise."
3737,there's there's a few few things that you just can't do with it it will also do a rolled edge um,It will not build a spaceship,1,0,False,"step 1. in the premise, 'there's a few things that you just can't do with it,' the speaker is expressing limitations to what 'it' can accomplish. the term 'it' is ambiguous and could refer to various objects or systems. however, the mention of 'rolled edge' suggests a physical object that might be a material or a structure. it's essential to note that the given premise does not provide enough context or specifications for concluding whether or not 'it' can build a spaceship.step 2. the hypothesis, 'it will not build a spaceship,' states a negative ability of 'it.' since the premise does not explicitly state or deny 'it's ability to build a spaceship,' the hypothesis is not logically entailed.step 3. based on the information provided, the hypothesis 'it will not build a spaceship' cannot be logically inferred from the premise 'there's a few things that you just can't do with it it will also do a rolled edge.'"
3738,"At ten o'clock, the two young men were at the appointed spot.",The two young men never made it to the meeting spot.,0,0,True,"step 1: in the premise, it is stated that the two young men were at the appointed spot at ten o'clock. this implies that they attended the meeting or event they were supposed to. step 2: the hypothesis suggests that they did not make it to the meeting spot. this contradicts the premise, as the presence of the young men at the spot directly contradicts the idea that they never arrived. step 3: based on the logical contradiction between the premise and hypothesis, it is clear that the hypothesis cannot be inferred from the premise."
3739,A rather tall man and a woman wearing a red top and blue jeans waiting at on the sidewalk.,The man and woman are standing in the shower.,0,0,True,"step 1: in the premise, we have the description of two individuals - a man and a woman - waiting on the sidewalk. there is no information about their actions or surroundings suggesting they are in a shower. in contrast, the hypothesis describes them being in a shower. step 2: the hypothesis directly contradicts the premise as the descriptions of their locations are incompatible. a shower is not a location that can be identified on a sidewalk. step 3: based on the information and logical principles provided, the hypothesis cannot be inferred from the premise."
3740,Auditors should perform such follow-up to determine whether officials of the audited entity have taken appropriate corrective actions.,"Audited entities aren't obligated to take appropriate corrective actions, and auditors don't need to check that.",0,0,True,"step 1: in the premise, it is stated that auditors should perform follow-up to determine if appropriate corrective actions have been taken by officials of the audited entity. this implies that such actions are expected and necessary.step 2: the hypothesis contradicts the premise by suggesting that audited entities aren't obligated to take appropriate corrective actions and auditors don't need to check it. the hypothesis states that there is no requirement for auditees to take corrective actions, which goes against the logical implication from the premise.step 3: based on the logical reasoning and the contradiction between the premise and hypothesis, the hypothesis is not entailed by the premise."
3741,But he knew that this was no delirium.,He was aware that it was all delirium.,0,0,True,"step 1: the premise states that 'he knew that this was no delirium,' which implies that the speaker is conscious and has a clear understanding of his surroundings. 'no delirium' means that there is no confusion or hallucination.step 2: the hypothesis suggests the opposite - 'he was aware that it was all delirium.' this means that the speaker was aware that his perceptions were false or illusory.step 3: the hypothesis contradicts the premise. 'knew that it was no delirium' implies a clear and rational state of mind, whereas 'was aware that it was all delirium' implies a state of confusion or hallucination. therefore, the hypothesis cannot be logically inferred from the premise.step 4: the hypothesis is not entailed by the premise, as they convey contradictory meanings."
3742,A man is looking affected by results from his poker game.,The man swimming,0,0,True,"step 1. the premise describes a man who is affected by results from his poker game. this suggests that something related to the poker game has caused an emotional response in the man. there are no explicit statements or implications about the man being near or in a swimming pool. common sense and factual consistency support the idea that the man's condition after a poker game does not inherently imply that he is swimming. step 2. the hypothesis 'the man swimming' cannot be logically inferred from the premise as there is no connection between the man's emotional state and swimming. step 3. based on the logical analysis, there is no entailment between the premise and the hypothesis."
3743,"Dijon is the capital of Burgundy and a center of art and architecture, of culture and learning.",Dijon boasts the greatest architecture in all of Burgundy. ,1,1,True,"step 1: in the premise, dijon is identified as the capital city of burgundy and known for its art, architecture, culture, and learning. this suggests that dijon is an important and significant city in burgundy. step 2: the hypothesis asserts that dijon 'boasts the greatest architecture' in burgundy. given that dijon is already known to be a significant center of culture and learning, and architecture is a part of this cultural significance, it is a reasonable inference that dijon would indeed have the greatest architecture in burgundy. step 3: based on the logical connection between the premise and hypothesis, and the common sense understanding that a city known for its cultural and architectural significance would likely have the greatest architecture within that region, the hypothesis can be inferred from the premise."
3745,and sometimes that's if you get a little soreness you feel like well i've done a good job because i got worked myself to that point but i guess you don't want to overdue but well have we reached our limit i'm not sure how long we've been talking but,"If you overdo it, you'll be laid up for a couple of days. ",1,1,True,"step 1: in the premise, the speaker mentions that they sometimes feel soreness after working hard, questioning if they've overdone it. this implies a connection between overexertion and the need for recovery. step 2: the hypothesis states that if one overdoes it, they'll be laid up for a couple of days. this is a logical consequence of the premise's content since the premise implies that overdoing it results in a need for rest and recovery. step 3: based on the logical connection between the premise and hypothesis, and the common-sense understanding of the consequences of overexertion, the hypothesis can be inferred from the premise."
3746,"The risk of improper payments increases in programs with (1) complex criteria for computing payments, (2) a significant volume of transactions, or (3) emphasis on expediting payments.",It's preferred to limit the number of transactions to make the risk reduced. ,1,0,False,"step 1: in the premise, three conditions are mentioned that contribute to an increased risk of improper payments - complex criteria for computing payments, a significant volume of transactions, and emphasis on expediting payments. step 2: the hypothesis suggests limiting the number of transactions as a way to reduce the risk of improper payments. based on common sense and logical reasoning, reducing the number of transactions can help mitigate the risk, as fewer transactions mean fewer opportunities for errors or fraudulent activities to occur. however, it's important to note that the hypothesis does not logically follow directly from the premise, as the premise does not state that the number of transactions is the only or primary factor affecting the risk of improper payments. instead, it's one of several factors. step 3: although the hypothesis cannot be logically inferred from the premise, it is consistent with the information provided in the premise and is a reasonable recommendation based on common sense and logical reasoning.step 4: an important distinction should be made between logical entailment and practical implication. while the hypothesis is not logically entailed by the premise, it is a practically implied consequence. this means that the hypothesis can be considered a reasonable conclusion based on the given information, even though it is not logically necessary.step 5: given that the hypothesis is a practically implied consequence of the premise and is consistent with common sense and logical reasoning, it can be considered a reasonable and valid conclusion.step 6: based on the logical reasoning, common sense, and consistency with the given information, the hypothesis is a reasonable conclusion, even though it is not logically entailed by the premise."
3747,i'm just uh it irritates me the way people mistreat animals and and they don't do it intentionally they just they're just doing it they go out and they think oh wouldn't it be cute to get a kitty,All people mistreat animals.,1,0,False,"step 1: in the premise, the speaker expresses their irritation towards people who mistreat animals, and mentions that this behavior is often unintentional. the speaker also acknowledges that these people may not realize the harm they are causing. step 2: the hypothesis, 'all people mistreat animals', is a significant overgeneralization from the premise. the premise describes a subset of people, those who mistreat animals unintentionally, not the entire population. step 3: based on the information provided, the hypothesis cannot be logically inferred from the premise as it is a stronger statement. the premise does not entail that all people mistreat animals."
3748,"However, regardless of how far the acquisition has advanced, at a minimum the auditor should always ascertain whether senior managers and users were involved in the project's initiation.",Auditors should only focus on current performance without regard to project launches.,0,0,True,"step 1: in the premise, the text suggests that auditors should be involved in investigating the involvement of senior managers and users in the initiation of a project, regardless of the current stage of the acquisition. this implies that the auditor's role extends beyond just evaluating current performance. step 2: the hypothesis, on the other hand, suggests that auditors should focus solely on current performance without any regard to project launches or the past. this is a contradictory statement to the information provided in the premise. step 3: based on the logical analysis, the hypothesis is not entailed by the premise, as the hypothesis proposes a different scope for the auditor's role compared to the premise."
3749,you know it's worthwhile to itemize and and last year i was the first year we reached that mark,We haven't reached that mark yet.,0,0,True,"step 1: in the premise, it is mentioned that 'we' reached 'that mark' for the first time last year. this implies that there was a specific financial or achievement goal that was met. the hypothesis suggests that 'we' have not reached that mark yet.step 2: the premise and hypothesis seem to contradict each other, as the premise indicates that the goal was reached in the past, while the hypothesis states that it has not been reached yet. however, the premise does not provide enough information to definitively conclude that the goal was not reached again after being reached last year.step 3: based on the given information, it is impossible to logically infer that the hypothesis is entailed by the premise. the premise and hypothesis are incompatible, but the premise does not logically entail the hypothesis."
3750,"Furthermore, the nature of this reallocation is such that the transferring entity does not receive anything of value and the recipient entity does not sacrifice anything of value.",The transferring entity can get or send anything.,0,0,True,"step 1: in the premise, it is stated that the 'transferring entity' does not receive anything of value in the reallocation process. this implies that the entity is giving or transferring something without gaining anything in return. the recipient entity is also not sacrificing anything of value.step 2: the hypothesis, however, suggests that the 'transferring entity' can 'get or send' something. this is not logically entailed by the premise because getting or sending something would imply receiving a value or benefit, which contradicts the information given in the premise.step 3: therefore, based on the given information and logical reasoning, the hypothesis that 'the transferring entity can get or send anything' is not entailed by the premise."
3751,"The Joint Venture which has so amply justified itself by success!"" It was drunk with acclamation.",There was no justification for The Joint Venture as it was unsuccessful.,0,0,True,"step 1: in the premise, 'the joint venture which has so amply justified itself by success' implies that the joint venture has been successful and has been praised for it. 'drunk with acclamation' further emphasizes this success. step 2: the hypothesis contradicts the premise, stating 'there was no justification for the joint venture as it was unsuccessful'. since the hypothesis contradicts the premise, it cannot be logically inferred from the premise. step 3: based on the logical analysis, the hypothesis is not entailed by the premise."
3752,"The Mycenaeans were an acquisitive race who came to conquer, not to trade.",Everything the Mycenaeans have came from pillaging. ,1,1,True,"step 1: the premise describes the mycenaeans as an acquisitive race who came to conquer, implying a desire for resources and wealth. it does not necessarily mean they only resorted to pillaging and not trading. however, the absence of mention of trading in the premise allows for the hypothesis to be plausible. step 2: the hypothesis suggests that all the possessions of the mycenaeans came from pillaging, which is a reasonable and specific inference from the premise. the premise establishes the mycenaeans as an acquisitive people who came to conquer, and pillaging is a common way for conquerors to obtain resources. step 3: based on the logical connection between the premise and hypothesis, and the lack of contradictory information, the hypothesis can be inferred from the premise."
3753,"In the far north, Pulau Penang is both holiday destination and commercial center, while closer to the border with Thailand, Pulau Langkawi is the newest resort destination for those in search of white sands and gentle seas.","In the far east, Pulau Penang is a dangerous war zone not suitable for any human being.",0,0,True,"step 1: in the premise, pulau penang is described as a holiday destination and commercial center in the far north. this implies that it is a populated and developed area. the description of pulau langkawi as a newest resort destination closer to the border with thailand suggests it is also a popular, peaceful, and safe area known for its white sands and gentle seas. step 2: the hypothesis contradicts the premise as it states that pulau penang, specifically in the far east, is a dangerous war zone. there is no logical or factual basis in the premise to support this hypothesis. in fact, the premise implies the opposite, that pulau penang is a desirable location. step 3: based on the logical reasoning and the factual inconsistency with the premise, the hypothesis is not entailed by the premise."
3754,It was indeed until 1869.,It was until 1867.,0,0,True,"step 1: both the premise and hypothesis are statements about a specific year. the premise indicates the year was 1869, and the hypothesis suggests it was 1867. step 2: the hypothesis contradicts the premise because 1867 is an earlier year than 1869. logically, a later year cannot be inferred from an earlier year. step 3: based on the logical contradiction between the premise and hypothesis, the hypothesis cannot be inferred from the premise."
3755,yeah  and then it lies in a drawer for about five or six years at least,Then it sits in a drawer for two hours.,0,0,True,"step 1: in the premise, the object lies in a drawer for five or six years. this implies that the duration of the object being in the drawer is significant. common sense and factual understanding do not provide enough information to directly infer anything about the hypothesis. however, the premise does not contradict the hypothesis.step 2: the hypothesis suggests that the object sits in a drawer for two hours. this is a much shorter duration than stated in the premise, so it cannot be directly inferred from the premise.step 3: based on the given information, the hypothesis is not entailed by the premise as the durations do not match."
3756,"But if you take it seriously, the anti-abortion position is definitive by definition.",People usually don't take anti-abortion positions seriously.,1,0,False,"step 1: in the premise, the statement 'but if you take it seriously, the anti-abortion position is definitive by definition' suggests that some people may view the anti-abortion position as being inflexible or extreme, but the speaker also acknowledges that taking it seriously is part of what defines the position. it is important to note that this premise does not provide any information about how most people view the anti-abortion position.step 2: the hypothesis 'people usually don't take anti-abortion positions seriously' contradicts the premise by stating that most people do not take the position seriously, which is inconsistent with the premise's assertion that the position is definitive and serious when taken seriously.step 3: based on the information in the premise and the logical contradiction with the hypothesis, it can be concluded that the hypothesis is not entailed by the premise."
3757,"And far, far away- lying still on the tracks- was the back of the train.",The train was speeding along the track. ,0,0,True,"step 1: in the premise, the train is described as being far, far away and lying still on the tracks. this implies that the train is not currently moving. common sense and factual knowledge tell us that a train lying still on the tracks is not consistent with a train speeding along the tracks. the premise does not contradict the hypothesis outright, but their descriptions are incompatible.step 2: based on the given information, the hypothesis 'the train was speeding along the track' cannot be logically inferred from the premise 'and far, far away- lying still on the tracks- was the back of the train'. the hypothesis is not a logical consequence of the premise.step 3: the hypothesis 'the train was speeding along the track' is not entailed by the premise 'and far, far away- lying still on the tracks- was the back of the train'. the descriptions are contradictory, and one cannot be logically inferred from the other."
3758,"An SBA official has confirmed that some agencies follow this practice, and SBA has not objected to it.",This practice involves conducting all performance reviews over lunch.,1,0,False,"step 1: in the premise, an sba official confirms that some agencies follow a certain practice without specifying what that practice is. the sba has not objected to it, suggesting that the practice is not against the rules. step 2: the hypothesis proposes a specific practice involving performance reviews conducted over lunch. however, the premise does not provide enough information to logically infer that this specific practice is the one being followed. step 3: based on the provided information, the hypothesis cannot be logically inferred from the premise as it is not a necessary conclusion."
3759,A woman in a blue shirt and black workout pants practicing martial arts in front of a house.,A woman has a white shirt.,0,0,True,"step 1: in the premise, we have information about what a woman is wearing - a blue shirt and black workout pants. this description does not contradict the hypothesis, which only mentions a change in the color of the woman's shirt. step 2: the hypothesis does not follow logically from the premise since the hypothesis introduces new information that is not mentioned in the premise. the woman wearing a white shirt is not entailed by the woman wearing a blue shirt. step 3: based on the given information, the hypothesis is not entailed by the premise."
3760,The market will saturate.,The market does not actually exist.,0,0,True,"step 1: a market saturates when the supply of a product or service equals or exceeds the demand. this means that all potential buyers have been served. the hypothesis, however, states that the market does not exist at all. these statements are fundamentally different. step 2: the hypothesis that 'the market does not actually exist' cannot be logically inferred from the premise 'the market will saturate'. in fact, for a market to saturate implies that it does exist, as saturation is a characteristic of a market. step 3: based on the logical analysis, the hypothesis 'the market does not actually exist' is not entailed by the premise 'the market will saturate'."
3761,All I know is they kept us working five solid weeks for nothing.,In the end all our efforts were for nothing.,1,1,True,"step 1: in the premise, it is stated that they kept the speakers working for five solid weeks with no compensation. this implies that no payment was received for the labor or efforts put in during that period. step 2: the hypothesis suggests that 'all our efforts were for nothing.' this is a logical implication of the premise. if no payment was received for five weeks of labor, then the efforts made during that time were indeed 'for nothing.' step 3: given that the hypothesis is a logical consequence of the premise, it can be inferred from the premise."
3762,A young boy and girl playing Pokemon.,Two children are playing.,1,1,True,"step 1: in the premise, we have two named entities - a young boy and a young girl. the context is given as 'playing pokemon', which implies that they are engaging in an activity together. this scenario is consistent with the hypothesis, as 'two children' is a broader term than 'young boy and young girl'. there are no contradictory facts or logical inconsistencies.step 2: the hypothesis 'two children are playing' can be inferred from the premise 'a young boy and girl playing pokemon'. the hypothesis is a more general statement that includes the information given in the premise.step 3: based on the logical reasoning, lack of contradictory facts, and the relationship between the premise and hypothesis, the hypothesis can be inferred from the premise."
3763,Only then did he realize how one chair could complicate his life.,The chair was made of wood and sitting on it gave him splinters.,1,0,False,"step 1: in the premise, 'he' realizes that one chair can complicate his life. 'complicate' implies some sort of difficulty or problem. the context does not provide any specific information about the chair itself.step 2: the hypothesis introduces a new element, suggesting the chair is made of wood and results in splinters when sat on. this is not directly stated or logically implied in the premise.step 3: the premise does not entail the hypothesis. the hypothesis introduces an unrelated detail about the chair's material and the consequence of sitting on it. this information is not necessary for the logical consistency or completion of the premise."
3764,"When professionals with the necessary skills cannot be hired, these organizations supplement the existing workforce with external information resources.",Disbanding the organization is the only option when faced with the inability to hire professionals. ,0,0,True,"step 1: in the premise, it is stated that organizations supplement their workforce with external information resources when they cannot hire professionals. this implies that the organizations continue to operate with the help of these resources. step 2: the hypothesis suggests that disbanding the organization is the only option when they cannot hire professionals. this directly contradicts the information in the premise, as disbanding the organization would mean an end to its operations. step 3: based on the logical relationship between the premise and hypothesis, the hypothesis is not entailed by the premise."
3765,you think so i bought a stationary bike but i find that if i sit on that seat too long it hurts,I have never ridden a stationary bike.,0,0,True,"step 1: the premise states that you have purchased a stationary bike but find it uncomfortable to sit on it for long periods. this implies that you have used the bike, which is a necessary condition for experiencing discomfort. step 2: the hypothesis, 'i have never ridden a stationary bike', directly contradicts the premise as it suggests that you have not used the bike at all. step 3: given the information in the premise, it is clear that the hypothesis is not logically entailed. in fact, the hypothesis is in direct contradiction to the premise."
3766,he writes the uh  action series,He's currently writing the second installment in his action series.,1,1,True,"step 1: in the premise, it is stated that 'he writes the action series'. this information implies that the person mentioned is an author and that they have written at least one installment in an action series. there are no logical inconsistencies or contradictions in the premise.step 2: the hypothesis suggests that the person is currently working on the second installment of their action series. given the information from the premise, it is reasonable to infer that someone who has already written the first installment in an action series would be likely to continue writing the subsequent installments, including the second one. this hypothesis is consistent with the premise.step 3: based on the logical consistency between the premise and hypothesis, and the common sense assumption that an author who has started a series would be likely to continue it, the hypothesis can be inferred from the premise."
3767,A person surfs through a wave as it crashes down.,A person is lying on the beach.,0,0,True,"step 1: the premise describes a person engaging in the activity of surfing, which involves riding a wave. surfing requires being in the water near or on a wave. step 2: the hypothesis describes a situation where a person is lying on the beach, which is the opposite of surfing. being on the beach and surfing are incompatible activities. step 3: based on the logical inconsistency between the premise and hypothesis, the hypothesis cannot be logically inferred from the premise."
3768,yeah i much prefer ham than i do turkey on Thanksgiving,I like turkey better than ham on Thanksgiving.,0,0,True,step 1: the premise states that the person's preference for ham is less than their preference for turkey on thanksgiving. this implies that they like turkey more than ham. step 2: the hypothesis states that the person's preference for turkey is greater than their preference for ham. this is the opposite of what's stated in the premise. step 3: the hypothesis cannot be logically inferred from the premise as they contradict each other.
3769,bronze oh interesting,The bronze coin is interesting.,1,1,True,"step 1: both the premise and hypothesis refer to the 'bronze coin' being 'interesting'. the key relationship here is the common subject and the shared property - 'interesting'. step 2: the hypothesis can be logically inferred from the premise as the premise implies that the 'bronze coin' is interesting, and the hypothesis simply states that 'the bronze coin is interesting'. step 3: given the logical equivalence between the premise and hypothesis, the hypothesis is a logical entailment of the premise."
3770,so we wound up selling it and it's been about uh i'd say eleven years uh since we got back into boating now they are big enough to,"During the eleven years we did not boat, we spent time flying helicopters instead.",1,0,False,"step 1: in the premise, it is stated that the speaker and possibly others stopped boating for about eleven years and have since returned. the hypothesis suggests an alternative activity during this time period, specifically flying helicopters. there is no contradictory information in the premise that would prevent the hypothesis from holding true. step 2: the hypothesis is not logically inferred from the premise, as there is no mention or implication of helicopter flying in the given scenario. however, it's important to note that the absence of evidence is not evidence of absence. the premise does not rule out the possibility that the speaker and others engaged in helicopter flying during the eleven years they did not boat. step 3: based on the given information, the hypothesis cannot be definitively determined to be either entailed or contradictory to the premise."
3771,"For those who want a slightly more challenging walk, but without a lot of hills to walk up and down, there are a number of routes in the Lake District with little or no gradient.",The Lake District is best for the elderly or the unfit but it is also beautiful.,1,0,False,"step 1: the premise describes the lake district as having routes with little or no gradient, making it a suitable option for those who want a walk that is slightly challenging but not too hilly. it does not specify who these people are, but it implies that they might be elderly or unfit. however, there is no explicit statement that only elderly or unfit people visit or enjoy the lake district. step 2: the hypothesis does not contradict the premise. it states that the lake district is beautiful, which is not in conflict with the premise's description of the lake district. step 3: the hypothesis 'the lake district is beautiful' can be considered a separate statement that is true regardless of the premise. while the premise provides context about certain aspects of the lake district, it does not entail the hypothesis. therefore, the hypothesis cannot be logically inferred from the premise. step 4: it is important to note that just because the hypothesis cannot be logically inferred from the premise, it does not mean that it is false. the premise and hypothesis can both be true independently."
3772,"As it turns out, Big Tobacco was ambivalent about the safe-cigarette projects because they exposed the industry to an uncomfortable double  Making a safer cigarette is tantamount to confessing that regular cigarettes are dangerous when taken as directed, something the industry had spent billions denying.",Big Tobacco did nothing to stop safe-cigarette projects.,1,0,False,"step 1: in the premise, it is stated that big tobacco was ambivalent about safe-cigarette projects due to the potential implication that their regular cigarettes are dangerous. this implies that big tobacco had some involvement with these projects, but they were hesitant due to the possible negative implications for their image and business. step 2: the hypothesis suggests that big tobacco did nothing to stop these projects. this is not a direct contradiction of the premise but rather a lack of action. however, the premise does not provide enough information to definitively infer that big tobacco took any action to actively support or promote these projects. step 3: based on the given information, it cannot be logically inferred that big tobacco did nothing to stop safe-cigarette projects as there is no clear contradiction or logical inconsistency between the premise and hypothesis. the premise only implies that big tobacco was hesitant due to the potential implications for their business."
3773,"(1961), currently placed as a sort of triumphal entryway to the southeast corner of Central Park, demonstrates the unsettling possibilities of tetrahedral shapes, where the triangular faces have a dynamic lightness lacking in rectangularly based structures.",There is no entryway in the southeast corner of Central Park.,0,0,True,"step 1: in the premise, a sculpture named (1961) is described as being in the southeast corner of central park and having the property of making the possibilities of tetrahedral shapes 'unsettling' due to their triangular faces and dynamic lightness. step 2: the hypothesis states that there is no entryway in the southeast corner of central park. this statement contradicts the information in the premise, as the premise describes the presence of a sculpture in that location. step 3: based on the logical negation of the information in the premise, the hypothesis cannot be inferred from it. the premise and hypothesis are logically contradictory."
3774,He'd gone a long way on what he'd found in one elementary book.,He learned a lot from that elementary book.,1,1,True,"step 1: in the premise, 'he'd gone a long way on what he'd found' implies that he had gained significant knowledge or understanding from the 'one elementary book'. this statement suggests that the content of the book was valuable and informative to him. step 2: the hypothesis 'he learned a lot from that elementary book' is a logical consequence of the premise, as it directly conveys that 'he' gained extensive knowledge from the 'elementary book'. step 3: based on the logical connection between the premise and hypothesis, and the lack of contradictory information, the hypothesis can be inferred from the premise."
3775,An additional field work standard for attestation engagements performed in accordance with GAGAS ,Attestation engagements require no standards and don't need to be in accordance with GAGAS.,0,0,True,"step 1: in the premise, 'an additional field work standard for attestation engagements performed in accordance with gagas' refers to a specific requirement or guideline for conducting attestation engagements under the generally accepted auditing standards (gagas). the hypothesis, 'attestation engagements require no standards and don't need to be in accordance with gagas,' directly contradicts the premise by stating that there should be no standards or adherence to gagas for attestation engagements.step 2: the hypothesis cannot be logically inferred from the premise, as it asserts the absence of what the premise establishes as a necessary condition for attestation engagements. the hypothesis contradicts the key information and relationships identified in the premise, and it goes against both logical principles and factual consistency.step 3: based on the logical reasoning and the fact that the hypothesis directly contradicts the premise, the hypothesis is not entailed by the premise."
3776,"Republican consultants agree that conservative candidates in the South, Southwest, Midwest, and Rocky Mountains will beg for Reed's talents and connections.",Republicans do not thing anyone will want Reed's talents.,0,0,True,"step 1: in the premise, it is stated that republican consultants agree that conservative candidates in certain regions will beg for reed's talents and connections. this implies that reed has valuable skills and connections that are sought after by republican candidates. step 2: the hypothesis, 'republicans do not think anyone will want reed's talents,' contradicts the information in the premise. the hypothesis suggests that the opposite of what the premise states is true. step 3: based on the logical analysis, the hypothesis cannot be inferred from the premise as it contradicts the information provided in the premise."
3777,"The company produced - produced several of their own shows in addition to bringing in shows from Broadway to California, often with their original casts.","The company produced or co-produced several of their own shows in addition to bringing in shows from Broadway to California, often with their original casts.",1,1,True,"step 1: in the premise, it is stated that the company produced several of their own shows in addition to bringing in shows from broadway to california, with original casts. this implies that the company was involved in the production of both their own shows and shows from broadway.step 2: the hypothesis is identical in meaning to the premise, with the only difference being the use of 'or' instead of 'and' before 'produced'. this change does not affect the logical relationship between the two sentences.step 3: since the hypothesis is logically equivalent to the premise, it can be logically inferred from the premise. the hypothesis is entailed by the premise."
3778,"Also downtown is the Flower Market, on Wall and 8th streets; fresh-cut flowers and a variety of plants can be had for bargain prices, but the best selections are found before dawn.",There's no market on Wall and 8th streets.,0,0,True,"step 1: in the premise, it is stated that there is a flower market downtown, specifically on wall and 8th streets. the market is described as a place where fresh-cut flowers and a variety of plants can be bought at bargain prices. the best selections are said to be found before dawn.step 2: the hypothesis states that there is 'no market' on wall and 8th streets. this is a direct contradiction to the premise, which states that there is a market on those streets.step 3: based on the given information, the hypothesis cannot be inferred from the premise as it contradicts it.step 4: in natural language reasoning, if a hypothesis contradicts the premise, it cannot be logically inferred from it."
3779,What does it all mean?,"I know what it all means, don't worry.",0,0,True,"step 1: the premise is a question expressing uncertainty or confusion about the meaning of something. it does not provide any specific information about the context or the meaning itself. the hypothesis, on the other hand, asserts a statement of knowing or understanding the meaning.step 2: the hypothesis cannot be logically inferred from the premise because the premise does not provide enough information for the hypothesis to follow. the hypothesis goes beyond the given information and makes a new statement, which is not directly related to the premise.step 3: based on the logical analysis, the hypothesis is not entailed by the premise."
3780,"Meanwhile, critics on the left argue that because the United States failed to intervene in Rwanda, its intervention in Kosovo is morally suspect and probably racist.",The US intervention in Kosovo is racist based.,1,0,False,"step 1: in the premise, critics on the left argue that the us intervention in kosovo is morally suspect due to its previous inaction in rwanda. they do not explicitly state that the intervention is racist, but they imply a connection between the two. step 2: the hypothesis asserts that the us intervention in kosovo is racist based. this is a stronger claim than what is stated in the premise. step 3: the hypothesis cannot be logically inferred from the premise as the premise does not provide sufficient evidence to support the hypothesis. the premise only states that critics make a connection between the us intervention in kosovo and its past inaction in rwanda, it does not directly imply that the intervention is racist. therefore, the hypothesis goes beyond the information provided in the premise."
3781,He bent down to study the tiny little jeweled gears.,The were no jewels on the gears he examined.,0,0,True,"step 1: in the premise, 'he bent down to study the tiny little jeweled gears.' we have the information that someone is examining gears that are described as 'tiny' and 'jeweled.' there are no logical inconsistencies or contradictions in this statement.step 2: in the hypothesis, 'there were no jewels on the gears he examined.' this statement contradicts the premise by negating the presence of jewels, but it doesn't logically follow from the premise. the premise does not provide enough information to infer the absence of jewels.step 3: based on the logical analysis, the hypothesis 'there were no jewels on the gears he examined' is not entailed by the premise 'he bent down to study the tiny little jeweled gears'. the hypothesis contradicts the premise but does not logically follow from it."
3782,So the first choice should be read as being between the certainty of being rich and a possibility of being rich.,The starting choice should not be read at all.,0,0,True,"step 1: in the premise, the context is about making a choice between two options. the first option is described as 'the certainty of being rich' and the second as 'a possibility of being rich'. there is no information provided about the nature or context of the starting choice mentioned in the hypothesis. step 2: the hypothesis is not related to the premise as it does not make any logical connection to the options described in the premise. the hypothesis suggests that there is no starting choice to be made at all. step 3: based on the given information, the hypothesis cannot be logically inferred from the premise as they address different aspects of the situation."
3784,"Today, not only do law school graduates forego the opportunities of a large salary, but they have these enormous tuition debt burdens.",Law school graduates are second to only medical students in terms of student debt levels.,1,1,True,"step 1: in the premise, it is stated that law school graduates have enormous tuition debt burdens. this implies that their debt levels are significant. step 2: the hypothesis suggests that law school graduates have second-highest student debt levels, which is consistent with the premise since it indicates high debt levels. common sense and statistical data support the idea that medical students often have the highest student debt levels. step 3: based on the logical consistency and factual support from the premise and common knowledge, the hypothesis can be inferred from the premise."
3785,Sports pundits likened him to Michael Jordan and Jack Nicklaus.,He was more renown than Andre Agassi.,1,1,True,"step 1: in the premise, sports pundits have compared the individual to michael jordan and jack nicklaus. comparisons to these legendary figures suggest a high level of skill, success, and renown in their respective sports. step 2: the hypothesis states that he was more renown than andre agassi. being compared to michael jordan and jack nicklaus implies a high level of fame, which is a necessary condition for being more renown than andre agassi. however, it does not directly imply that he is more renown than michael jordan or jack nicklaus themselves. step 3: while the hypothesis cannot be logically inferred directly from the premise because it does not address the comparisons to michael jordan and jack nicklaus, it is a reasonable inference based on the information provided. the comparison to michael jordan and jack nicklaus strongly suggests a high level of renown, and it is common sense that being more renown than andre agassi implies a level of fame greater than him."
3786,Sometimes the junction name also refers to the surrounding community as well as just the highway junction itself.,Sometimes the junction name also refers to the surrounding community or area as well as just the highway junction itself.,1,1,True,"step 1: in the premise, it is stated that sometimes a junction name refers to both the highway junction itself and the surrounding community or area. this is a known fact or common practice in naming junctions. step 2: the hypothesis repeats the same information as the premise. it follows the same logical structure and semantic meaning. step 3: given that the hypothesis is identical in meaning to the premise, it is a logical entailment. this means that the hypothesis is a necessary consequence of the premise. step 4: the hypothesis is not adding any new information, but rather restating the information already present in the premise. therefore, the hypothesis is entailed by the premise."
3787,Best  Better Management of Technology Development Can Improve Weapon System Outcomes.,Best Better Management of Technology development can improve missle launch systems.,1,1,True,"step 1: in the premise, 'best management of technology development' is stated as having the ability to improve 'weapon system outcomes'. this implies that effective management of technology development is a critical factor in the success of weapon systems. no specific type of weapon system is mentioned, leaving the possibility open for various applications.  step 2: the hypothesis proposes that 'best management of technology development' can improve 'missile launch systems'. since the premise establishes a logical connection between effective technology management and successful weapon system outcomes, it follows that effective management of technology development can also contribute to the improvement of missile launch systems. step 3: based on the logical connection between technology management and weapon system success, and the specific application of this connection to missile launch systems in the hypothesis, the hypothesis can be inferred from the premise."
3788,uh that we projected that it that it actually cost companies by having people uh uh be involved with drugs,Having people involved in drugs does not affect companies in any way.,0,0,True,"step 1: in the premise, it is stated that 'we projected that it actually cost companies by having people involved with drugs'. this implies that there is a known cost associated with employees using drugs in the workplace. step 2: the hypothesis, 'having people involved in drugs does not affect companies in any way', directly contradicts the premise. it asserts that there is no impact on companies when their employees use drugs. step 3: based on the information in the premise, the hypothesis cannot be logically inferred. in fact, it contradicts the premise and goes against the known fact that there can be costs associated with employees using drugs in the workplace."
3789,"An artificial cliffside was created on higher ground, matching the old in height and alignment.",The new cliffside made does not match the measurements of the old one.,0,0,True,"step 1: in the premise, an artificial cliffside was created to match the old one in height and alignment. this implies that the new cliffside is a close replica of the old one in terms of its vertical dimensions and position.step 2: the hypothesis suggests that the new cliffside does not match the measurements of the old one. this means that there is a discrepancy between the vertical dimensions or alignment of the two cliffsides, as measured.step 3: the hypothesis contradicts the premise because the premise states that the new cliffside matches the old one in height and alignment, while the hypothesis claims that they do not match in terms of measurements. therefore, the hypothesis cannot be logically inferred from the premise."
3790,"Otherwise, it's more fun to explore the country along the good-quality secondary roads (routes nationales, with a number preceded by an N).",The country has good secondary roads to travel on.,1,1,True,"step 1: in the premise, the speaker expresses a preference for exploring the country on good-quality secondary roads (routes nationales). this implies that such roads exist in the country. step 2: the hypothesis simply states that the country has good secondary roads to travel on. this is a direct implication of the premise, as the premise assumes the existence and goodness of these roads for the speaker to prefer them. step 3: based on the logical connection between the two statements, the hypothesis is entailed by the premise."
3791,"For centuries, the Loire river was a vital highway between the Atlantic and the heart of France.",The Loire stopped being a vital highway shortly after the revolution.,1,0,False,"step 1. in the premise, it is mentioned that the loire river was a vital highway between the atlantic and the heart of france for centuries. this implies that the loire played a significant role in transportation and commerce in that region for a long time. step 2. the hypothesis states that the loire stopped being a vital highway shortly after the revolution. however, the premise does not provide any information about the loire's significance or role after the revolution. therefore, we cannot logically infer the hypothesis from the premise based on the given information. step 3. the hypothesis is not entailed by the premise."
3792,you go during the week,You can never go.,0,0,True,"step 1: in the premise, 'you go during the week', the subject 'you' is performing an action 'go' and the time frame is specified as 'during the week'. the term 'week' refers to a seven-day period. this information does not provide any contradiction or logical link to the hypothesis. step 2: the hypothesis 'you can never go' is a negation of the action 'go' for the subject 'you'. this statement directly contradicts the premise, as the premise states that 'you go' at least some of the time during the week. step 3: based on the logical negation of the premise, the hypothesis 'you can never go' cannot be logically inferred from the premise."
3793,"They fear that if border collies are bred for the color of their coats rather than the content of their character, eventually their herding instinct will fade away.",Border collies have been the most popular dogs this decade.,1,0,False,"step 1: in the premise, there is an expression of concern that focusing on the coat color of border collies for breeding may lead to the fading away of their herding instinct. this implies that the herding instinct is an essential and valued trait in border collies. step 2: the hypothesis, stating that border collies have been the most popular dogs this decade, does not directly relate to or contradict the information in the premise. popularity does not guarantee preservation of traits or instincts. step 3: based on the logical analysis, the hypothesis cannot be logically inferred from the premise as the premise does not provide sufficient information about the current state or condition of border collies regarding their herding instinct or popularity."
3794,actually i listened to one time i remember it's this is back when rap even uh i would say about ten or fifteen years ago i,I listen to wrap everyday and has been my favorite genre for 15 years. ,0,0,True,"step 1: in the premise, the speaker mentions that they listened to rap music 'one time' approximately ten to fifteen years ago. this implies that they have not been listening to rap music daily or as their favorite genre for the past 15 years.step 2: the hypothesis states that the speaker 'listen[s] to rap everyday' and that 'rap has been my favorite genre for 15 years'. this contradicts the information provided in the premise, as the speaker did not listen to rap daily or consider it their favorite genre for the past 15 years.step 3: based on the logical analysis and the contradiction between the premise and hypothesis, the hypothesis cannot be inferred from the premise."
3795,Chernow attributes this attitude to Rockefeller's uncommon respect for the dollar.,Rockefeller loved the dollar so much that he married it.,1,0,False,"step 1: in the premise, chernow indicates that rockefeller had an unusual respect for the dollar. this respect is described as an 'attitude'. step 2: the hypothesis proposes an extreme form of respect for the dollar, suggesting a romantic or marital love. while it is not inconceivable for someone to have such an intense emotional attachment to an abstract concept like money, there is no factual or logical basis in the premise to support this particular claim. step 3: based on the given information, the hypothesis cannot be logically inferred from the premise."
3796,"Walcott twins Clare--who was driven mad by social injustice and consoled by the smallest beings in nature--with mad Tom, Edgar's disguise in King Lear , who, like Clare, wanders the English countryside praising frogs and  I am moved like you, mad Tom, by a line of ants;/ I behold their industry and they are giants.",Clare hated nature.,0,0,True,"step 1: the premise describes clare's relationship with nature, mentioning that she was driven mad by social injustice and found solace in the smallest beings in nature. it does not explicitly state that clare hated nature, but it does indicate a complex relationship.step 2: the hypothesis, which states that 'clare hated nature,' is a direct contradiction of the information provided in the premise. the premise suggests that clare found comfort in nature during her madness, which is not consistent with the idea of hating nature.step 3: based on the information provided in the premise, the hypothesis 'clare hated nature' cannot be logically inferred. the premise indicates a complex relationship between clare and nature, but it does not support the idea that she hated nature."
3797,"Some of these agencies, such as VBA and IRS, used a balanced scorecard approach, which is intended to provide a balanced perspective regarding agency results, customer satisfaction, and employee feedback.",Agencies such as VBA are not interested in measurable feedback.,0,0,True,"step 1: in the premise, it is mentioned that some agencies, including vba, use a balanced scorecard approach. this approach is described as providing a balanced perspective regarding agency results, customer satisfaction, and employee feedback. this implies that agencies, including vba, are interested in collecting and considering various forms of feedback. step 2: the hypothesis contradicts the premise by stating that agencies, specifically vba, are not interested in measurable feedback. however, the premise already establishes that vba, among other agencies, is interested in feedback, which is a measurable aspect of the balanced scorecard approach. step 3: based on the logical contradiction between the premise and hypothesis, and the fact that the premise provides evidence that vba is interested in measurable feedback, the hypothesis cannot be logically inferred from the premise.step 4: it is important to note that this analysis is based on the given information and logical reasoning. it is possible that additional context or information could change the conclusion. for instance, if there was evidence suggesting that vba only collects feedback but does not use it to make decisions or improve performance, then the hypothesis could be more plausible. however, with the current information, the hypothesis is not logically entailed by the premise."
3798,I remember endless hallway discussions about how to balance the demand for lean and quick code against the bloat required to add new and nifty features.,The discussions resolved the disputes.,1,0,False,"step 1: in the premise, there is a description of ongoing discussions about balancing code demands. no clear resolution or outcome is mentioned. however, the use of the term 'endless' might imply that the discussions were lengthy and thorough. step 2: the hypothesis suggests that the disputes were resolved. however, the premise does not explicitly state that the disputes were resolved. the hypothesis is a possible implication, but it is not logically entailed. common sense and logical principles suggest that a resolution does not necessarily follow from ongoing discussions. step 3: based on the information provided, the hypothesis cannot be logically inferred from the premise. the premise only describes ongoing discussions, it does not indicate a resolution."
3799,"The still-life objects have escaped, leaving the bare table, the bare canvas.",The still-life objects have been erased by the painter.,1,1,True,"step 1: the premise describes the situation where the still-life objects have left the table and the canvas is now bare. this implies that the objects are no longer present. step 2: the hypothesis suggests that the still-life objects have been erased, which means they have been removed in a different sense - by being painted over, rather than physically moved. this interpretation is plausible since the context implies a studio setting where an artist might be painting. step 3: though the premise and hypothesis describe the still-life objects in different ways (physically absent vs. painted over), they both convey that the still-life objects are no longer present on the table and canvas. therefore, the hypothesis can be inferred from the premise, as it provides an alternative explanation for the same observable outcome.step 4: it is also worth noting that the common-sense understanding of the premise doesn't limit the removal of objects to physical movement, which allows for the logical connection between the premise and hypothesis.step 5: furthermore, the premise does not provide any information about how or why the objects have left the table. the hypothesis provides a reasonable explanation for their disappearance, as it is a common practice for painters to paint over their previous work.step 6: in conclusion, the hypothesis can be logically inferred from the premise as it offers a reasonable explanation for the observable outcome in the premise, which is the absence of the still-life objects from the table and canvas."
3800,"They broke up in 2004, leaving behind two studio albums and three EPs.","They broke up in 2004, leaving behind twelve studio albums and three EPs.",0,0,True,"step 1: in the premise, it is stated that they broke up in 2004 and left behind two studio albums and three eps. this information does not provide any logical connection to the number twelve studio albums. step 2: the hypothesis suggests a different number of studio albums (twelve), but it still maintains the same premise that they broke up in 2004 and left behind some studio albums and eps. the hypothesis does not contradict the premise, as the premise does not specify an exact number of studio albums. step 3: the hypothesis cannot be logically inferred from the premise, as the premise does not provide sufficient information to make that conclusion. the hypothesis introduces new information that is not supported by the premise."
3801,that's pathetic that's pathetic it's,That's great,0,0,True,"step 1: in this example, both the premise and hypothesis are instances of the same statement, 'that's (something)'. the meaning of this statement is subjective and does not convey any specific logical relationship or factual information. step 2: the hypothesis 'that's great' cannot be logically inferred from the premise 'that's pathetic' because they express opposing emotional assessments, not logical implications. step 3: based on the information given, the hypothesis does not follow logically from the premise."
3802,is uh it uh yeah it can add up quick,It never adds up quick. ,0,0,True,"step 1: in the premise, the speaker expresses that 'it can add up quick'. this statement indicates that the sum of certain quantities can be calculated relatively fast.step 2: the hypothesis, 'it never adds up quick', suggests the opposite, that the sum of certain quantities can't be calculated quickly. the hypothesis contradicts the information provided in the premise.step 3: based on the logical negation of the premise in the hypothesis and the contradictory nature of the statements, the hypothesis is not entailed by the premise.step 4: it is essential to note that the premise is a statement from a speaker and does not represent an objective fact. the hypothesis, on the other hand, is a universal claim, which is unlikely to be true in all cases. therefore, the lack of entailment between the premise and hypothesis does not necessarily imply that either statement is incorrect, but rather that they convey different information."
3803,"You, Shannon, what're you doin' here?",SHannon never showed up.,0,0,True,"step 1: in the premise, 'you, shannon, what're you doin' here?' is a question asking for an explanation of shannon's presence. this implies that shannon is indeed present at the scene. step 2. the hypothesis, 'shannon never showed up,' contradicts the information in the premise, suggesting that shannon was not present. step 3: given the clear contradiction between the premise and hypothesis, the hypothesis cannot be logically inferred from the premise.step 3: the hypothesis 'shannon never showed up' is not entailed by the premise 'you, shannon, what're you doin' here?'."
3804,It isn't anymore.,It stopped being about five minutes ago. ,1,1,True,"step 1: in the premise, 'it isn't anymore' implies that there was once a state, but that state no longer exists. the meaning of 'it isn't anymore' is not explicitly defined in the premise, but it can be inferred that 'it' refers to a situation, object, or condition that previously existed. the term 'anymore' suggests that this state, object, or condition has recently ceased to exist.step 2: the hypothesis suggests that 'it' stopped being 'about five minutes ago'. this implies that there was also a previous state of 'it', which has since ended. the hypothesis does not contradict the premise as both statements refer to the cessation of a state or condition.step 3: based on the information provided, the hypothesis can be inferred from the premise. if 'it' refers to the same thing mentioned in the premise, then the hypothesis states that this 'it' stopped being five minutes prior to the speaker's utterance of 'it isn't anymore'. this is a reasonable inference as the timing specified in the hypothesis does not contradict the premise.step 4: it is important to note that the premise and hypothesis contain vague and ambiguous language. the term 'it' in the premise is not explicitly defined, and the term 'about five minutes ago' in the hypothesis is also ambiguous. the interpretation of these statements relies on the context and common sense understanding of the situation.therefore, the hypothesis is a reasonable inference from the premise, given the available information and the logical interpretation of the ambiguous language."
3806,fortunately the Bills won,The Bills winning is the best thing that could have happened.,1,1,True,"step 1: in the premise, it is stated that 'fortunately' the bills won. the word 'fortunately' implies that a good or desirable outcome resulted. step 2: the hypothesis suggests that 'the bills winning is the best thing that could have happened'. this statement can be considered a stronger positive assessment of the outcome than what is stated in the premise. however, it is a logical extension of the premise since the premise implies that the bills winning was a desirable outcome. step 3: based on the logical reasoning, the hypothesis can be inferred from the premise."
3807,(Budget Director Frank Raines dismissed such details as boring.,Frank Raines was intrigued by the details he deemed important. ,0,0,True,"step 1: the premise indicates that frank raines dismissed certain details as boring. this suggests a lack of interest or excitement towards those details. step 2: the hypothesis states that frank raines was intrigued by the details he deemed important. this contradicts the premise, as intrigue implies a level of interest or fascination with the details. step 3: based on the logical inconsistency between the premise and hypothesis, it cannot be logically inferred that 'frank raines was intrigued by the details he deemed important' is entailed by 'frank raines dismissed such details as boring'. step 4: it is important to note that the common sense understanding of the words 'intrigued' and 'boring' can lead to different interpretations. however, the information provided in the premise and hypothesis does not allow for a reasonable assumption of a change in frank raines' feelings towards the details. therefore, the hypothesis cannot be inferred from the premise based on the given information."
3808,"It covers every angle a young media entrepreneur could dream  highbrow nonfiction (the first comprehensive collection of King's sermons); innovative nonfiction (a King autobiography cobbled together from his writings); audiotapes of King speeches; high-tech (a fancy civil-rights Web site); and even a little snack for Dexter's ego (the young man's memoirs, which are to include his thoughts on health and nutrition).",King has a lot of unusual opinions on diet and health.,1,1,True,"step 1: the premise describes a comprehensive collection of works by martin luther king jr., which includes various formats like highbrow nonfiction, innovative nonfiction, audiotapes, a high-tech civil-rights web site, and the young man's memoirs. the memoirs are a part of the collection and mentioned as including 'his thoughts on health and nutrition'. step 2: from the premise, it can be inferred that king's memoirs contain information about his opinions on health and nutrition. the hypothesis, stating 'king has a lot of unusual opinions on diet and health', is related to the information in the premise as it suggests that king's opinions on health and nutrition are not typical or common. step 3: based on the information provided in the premise and the logical connection between the premise and hypothesis, the hypothesis can be inferred from the premise."
3809,but how come we weren't doing this say twenty years ago you know,"but why didn't we do this before, when it would have done a lot more good",1,1,True,"step 1: in this context, both the premise and hypothesis express questions about why an action wasn't taken in the past. the premise mentions 'twenty years ago' and the hypothesis asks 'before'. the key information here is the lack of action taken in the past and the curiosity as to why.step 2: the hypothesis can be inferred from the premise as they express identical questions about the past. the hypothesis is a more specific version of the question posed in the premise. it does not contradict the premise but rather provides a more precise statement of the situation.step 3: based on the logical relationship between the premise and hypothesis, the hypothesis is entailed by the premise. both sentences are asking the same question in slightly different ways, so the hypothesis can be considered a logical consequence of the premise."

3811,"He ain't said much, 'cept Kitchell jumped him down Long Canyon way """,He talked their ear off about many things other than being jumped.,0,0,True,"step 1: in the premise, 'he ain't said much, 'cept kitchell jumped him' implies that the person being discussed spoke very little and mainly mentioned an incident where he was jumped by someone named kitchell. this information does not provide any details about what they might have talked about in other circumstances.step 2: the hypothesis, 'he talked their ear off about many things other than being jumped' contradicts the information given in the premise. while 'talked their ear off' implies that the person spoke extensively, the premise states that they spoke very little.step 3: based on the logical analysis, the hypothesis cannot be inferred from the premise as it contradicts the information provided."
3812,"Earlier in the column, however, he exposes the flaw in this idea.","In the first paragraph, he shows why this is a problem.",1,1,True,"step 1: in the premise, it is mentioned that 'earlier in the column' the author exposes a flaw in an idea. this implies that there is a previous discussion or argument regarding this idea. the hypothesis suggests that this exposing or showing of the flaw happens 'in the first paragraph'. these two pieces of information can coexist, as the first paragraph could be where the author introduces or initiates the discussion of the flaw. step 2: the hypothesis 'in the first paragraph, he shows why this is a problem' can be inferred from the premise 'earlier in the column, he exposes the flaw in this idea'. this is because the first paragraph is a part of the earlier column, and the hypothesis describes an action (showing why it's a problem) that is consistent with the premise. step 3: based on the logical connection between the premise and hypothesis and the fact that they do not contradict each other, the hypothesis can be inferred from the premise."
3813,"The fort, built by the Jesuits in the 17th century as a defense against the Dutch, was largely destroyed by the same fire that burned St. Paul's.","The Jesuit fort survived the wild blaze that consumed its neighbor, St. Paul's.",0,0,True,"step 1. in the premise, we have information about a jesuit fort built in the 17th century and its destruction by the same fire that burned st. paul's. st. paul's is identified as having been consumed by the fire. no specific information is given regarding the state or destruction of the jesuit fort after the mention of the fire.step 2. the hypothesis claims that the jesuit fort survived the fire. this directly contradicts the premise, as the premise states that the jesuit fort was largely destroyed by the same fire that consumed st. paul's.step 3. based on the given information and logical principles, the hypothesis is not entailed by the premise, as the hypothesis contradicts the premise."
3814,"King Felipe II ordered El Escorial built in celebration of Spain's victory over French forces in 1557 at the battle of St. Quentin, in France.",El Escorial was never completed.,0,0,True,"step 1: in the premise, king felipe ii ordered the construction of el escorial in commemoration of spain's victory over french forces in 1557. this indicates that el escorial was started. common sense and historical records support that the construction of such a large and intricate monastery would have taken considerable time to complete. step 2: the hypothesis, 'el escorial was never completed,' contradicts the premise. if el escorial was not completed, then king felipe ii did not order its construction in celebration of spain's victory. step 3: based on the logical relationship between the premise and hypothesis, the hypothesis cannot be inferred from the premise. the premise states that el escorial was built, while the hypothesis contradicts this fact."
3815,"(One of the most photogenic views is from the north, on the road from Certaldo, home and last resting place of Boccaccio. )",From Certaldo you can take pictures of the sea.,1,1,True,"step 1. in the premise, certaldo is mentioned as a place where one of the most photogenic views is located. no specific mention is made about the landscape or scenery that is being viewed. however, the term 'photogenic' generally implies that the view is visually appealing and worth taking pictures of. step 2. the hypothesis suggests that from certaldo, you can take pictures of the sea. this is not directly mentioned in the premise, but it is reasonable to infer that if there is a photogenic view from certaldo, it could potentially include the sea since the italian coastline is well-known for its scenic beauty. step 3. based on logical reasoning and commonsense understanding, the hypothesis can be inferred from the premise, as it is a plausible extension of the information provided in the premise."
3816,Two children are sitting in the same wooden lawn chair while a green rake is leaning against the same chair.,Two children are on the lawn.,1,1,True,"step 1: in the premise, we have the information that two children are sitting in a wooden lawn chair, and a green rake is leaning against the same chair. the key information here is that the children are sitting on the lawn, as indicated by the use of the term 'lawn chair'. additionally, there's no information given that contradicts the hypothesis.step 2: the hypothesis, 'two children are on the lawn', is logically entailed by the premise. the children being on the lawn is a necessary condition for them to be sitting on the lawn chair. the presence of the lawn chair on the lawn further supports this conclusion.step 3: based on the logical reasoning and the lack of contradictory information, the hypothesis is entailed by the premise."

3822,"The larger parks are quite expensive, so plan a long stay to get your money's worth.",The larger parks aren't substantially more expensive than smaller parks.,1,0,False,"step 1: in the premise, it is stated that larger parks are quite expensive. this implies a comparison to something else, which is not explicitly stated but can be inferred to be 'smaller parks'. step 2: the hypothesis contradicts the premise by stating that larger parks aren't substantially more expensive. this creates a logical inconsistency. step 3: based on the given information and logical principles, the hypothesis cannot be inferred from the premise since the hypothesis contradicts the premise."
3823,previous governments declined the plea.,Many muslim organizations appealed for the release of Mohammed abdul qadeer on the grounds of his health but previous governments declined the plea.,1,0,False,"step 1: in the premise, it is stated that previous governments declined a plea. the nature of the plea is not specified in the given information. in the hypothesis, it is mentioned that muslim organizations appealed for the release of mohammed abdul qadeer based on his health. this information doesn't contradict the premise as the identity of the plea's originators (muslim organizations) and the reason for the plea (mohammed abdul qadeer's health) are not mentioned in the premise.step 2: the hypothesis does not logically follow from the premise because the premise does not state that the appeals came from the source mentioned in the hypothesis (muslim organizations) or that the reason for the appeals was mohammed abdul qadeer's health. the hypothesis adds new information to the premise.step 3: based on the given information, the hypothesis cannot be inferred from the premise as it introduces unstated facts."

",Jane Finn is as beautiful as she is mysterious.,1,0,False,"step 1: in the premise, jane finn is described as long-sought, mysterious, and elusive. these descriptors do not provide any direct information about jane finn's physical appearance. however, the use of words like 'long-sought' and 'mysterious' implies a certain intrigue or allure about her. step 2: the hypothesis suggests that jane finn is not only mysterious but also beautiful. this statement is not directly contradictory to the information in the premise, as there is no mention of jane finn's appearance being unattractive in the premise. step 3: based on the given information, it cannot be logically determined if the hypothesis is true or false. the hypothesis is not entailed by the premise, nor is it contradictory. it is an additional statement about jane finn that is not necessarily true or false based on the information provided in the premise."
3825,"John McKay, president of the organization, said the refocused and larger programs can raise more money, find more lawyers and increase the number of poor people who get help through the civil courts system.",McKay said they can get more volunteers to help close the budget gap.,1,0,False,"step 1: in the premise, john mckay, the president of the organization, is stating that the refocused and larger programs can lead to raising more money, finding more lawyers, and helping more poor people through the civil courts system. this implies an expansion of resources and capabilities for the organization.step 2: the hypothesis suggests that mckay mentioned something about getting more volunteers. while the premise does not explicitly state this, it does not contradict the hypothesis, and there is no mention of a reason why volunteers could not be part of the expanded resources and capabilities.step 3: based on the given information, the hypothesis is not directly entailed by the premise as the premise does not explicitly mention volunteers. however, it is not a contradiction as volunteers can be considered part of the 'more people who get help' referred to in the premise. the premise leaves room for various means to achieve the stated goals, including the involvement of volunteers, so the hypothesis could potentially be true given the given context. therefore, the label is 0 for no entailment but the hypothesis is not contradictory to the premise."

3828,"A man walking into a shadow, holding a sign.",A man running away from people.,0,0,True,"step 1: in the premise, a man is described as walking into a shadow while holding a sign. the shadow could indicate an attempt to hide or escape from something, but it does not necessarily mean that the man is running away from people. the presence of a sign is not relevant to the hypothesis.step 2: the hypothesis introduces a new element, 'running away from people', which is not directly mentioned in the premise. running away from people could be inferred from other contextual information, but it is not logically entailed by the premise.step 3: based on the given information, the hypothesis 'a man running away from people' cannot be logically inferred from the premise 'a man walking into a shadow, holding a sign'. the premise does not provide sufficient evidence to support the hypothesis."
3829,"Clearly, yes.","Obviously, the answer is no. ",0,0,True,"step 1: in the premise, the words 'clearly, yes' are used to assert a positive statement, but no specific information is provided. the hypothesis, 'obviously, the answer is no', contradicts the premise's potential meaning. step 2: the hypothesis cannot be logically inferred from the premise because the hypothesis' negative assertion contradicts the potential positive meaning of the premise. there is no logical connection between the two statements. step 3: based on the lack of logical connection and the contradictory nature of the hypothesis, the hypothesis is not entailed by the premise."
3831,so it it just doesn't hold water and you look at some of the other countries that that have the death penalty,"It makes perfect sense, so there's no need to look elsewhere for answers.",0,0,True,"step 1: in the premise, the speaker expresses doubt about the validity of an argument related to the death penalty, suggesting that there may be other countries to consider for answers. this implies an open-ended exploration of the topic. in contrast, the hypothesis asserts that the current topic is sufficient and needs no further examination. step 2: the hypothesis contradicts the premise by closing off the possibility of further exploration and considering alternative perspectives. step 3: based on this logical analysis, the hypothesis is not entailed by the premise."

3845,Traditional Dance and Theater,Modern dance and theater ,0,1,False,"step 1. the premise 'traditional dance and theater' refers to a specific type of artistic performance rooted in cultural heritage and history. it involves dance and theater, suggesting a live performance with music, costumes, and actors.step 2. the hypothesis 'modern dance and theater' refers to contemporary forms of artistic performance that evolved from traditional dance and theater. modern dance and theater may retain some elements of the traditional forms but often incorporate new techniques, themes, or styles.step 3. the hypothesis 'modern dance and theater' can be logically inferred from the premise 'traditional dance and theater' as modern dance and theater are directly derived from traditional dance and theater. the evolution from traditional to modern does not negate the original definition but rather represents a continuation and development of the art form.step 4. the relationship between the premise and hypothesis is that of a broader category to a specific subcategory. in logical terms, the hypothesis 'modern dance and theater' is entailed by the premise 'traditional dance and theater'.step 5. based on logical reasoning, common sense, and the given information, the hypothesis can be inferred from the premise."
3846,"The natural paste, meanwhile, lacks all bite, and your mouth feels dirtier after you've brushed.",The natural paste may have negative effects due to its properties.,1,1,True,"step 1: in the premise, it is stated that the natural paste lacks bite and leaves your mouth feeling dirtier after brushing. this implies that the natural paste does not effectively clean the teeth and may even have an unpleasant after-feel. step 2: the hypothesis 'the natural paste may have negative effects due to its properties' is consistent with the information in the premise, as it also suggests that the natural paste has unfavorable characteristics. step 3: based on the information in the premise and the logical connection between the lack of effectiveness and negative effects, the hypothesis can be inferred from the premise."
3847,have you watched any of those games,I've watched all of them this season.,1,0,False,"step 1: in the premise, it is being asked if i have watched any of the games. this suggests that there is a collection or series of games in question. step 2: the hypothesis states that the speaker has watched all of the games this season. this is a stronger claim than the premise as it implies not only that they have watched some of the games, but all of them. step 3: if the hypothesis is true, then it follows logically that it falls under the category of having watched 'any of those games' as stated in the premise. however, the hypothesis makes a stronger claim and cannot be directly inferred from the premise as stated. it is possible for someone to have watched any of the games but not all of them. therefore, the hypothesis is not logically entailed by the premise. step 4: it's important to note that the premise does not provide any context or information about the speaker or the games that would make it more likely or less likely that they have watched all of the games. without further context, it's impossible to determine if the hypothesis is true or not based on the premise alone.step 5: in conclusion, the hypothesis 'i've watched all of them this season' is not logically entailed by the premise 'have you watched any of those games'. the hypothesis makes a stronger claim than the premise and requires additional context or information to be determined as true or false."
3848,She married him without love. ,She married him for the money.,1,0,False,"step 1: the premise states that she married him without love. this implies that there was no emotional attachment between them. step 2: the hypothesis suggests that she married him for financial reasons. while the premise does not directly provide information about her motivation for marriage, it does not contradict the hypothesis. lack of love does not rule out financial motivation. step 3: while the premise does not logically entail the hypothesis, the absence of contradiction and the general human motivation to seek financial security or stability can make the hypothesis a plausible inference."

3850,The planners were told that their plan was non-responsive to the issues identified in LSC Program Letters 98-1 and 98-6 and in need of major work.,The planners were informed that their plan adequately addressed the concerns stated in the LSC Program Letters.,0,0,True,"step 1: in the premise, it is stated that the planners were told that their plan was non-responsive to the issues identified in lsc program letters 98-1 and 98-6 and needed major work. this implies that the planners received feedback indicating that their plan did not meet the requirements set out in these letters.step 2: the hypothesis suggests that the planners were informed that their plan adequately addressed the concerns stated in the lsc program letters. this is the opposite of what was stated in the premise.step 3: based on the information provided, the hypothesis cannot be logically inferred from the premise as they are in direct contradiction to each other.step 4: furthermore, common sense and logical principles suggest that if the planners were told their plan needed major work, it is unlikely that they were also informed it adequately addressed the concerns without any changes being made.step 5: therefore, the conclusion is that there is no entailment between the premise and hypothesis."
3851,boy runs you like twenty something dollars in the store,Girls run about 5mph.,0,0,True,"step 1. the premise describes a situation where a boy spends around twenty something dollars in a store. there is no direct connection to the hypothesis about girls running 5mph. step 2. the hypothesis, on its own, states that girls run at about 5mph. it does not directly relate to or contradict the premise. step 3. based on the given information, the hypothesis cannot be logically inferred from the premise."
3852,uh i graduated in eighty six,I didn't graduate until the 90s.,0,0,True,"step 1: in the premise, the person states that they graduated in 1986. this is a specific piece of information. in the hypothesis, the person states that they didn't graduate until the 1990s. this is a contradiction of the premise. step 2: the hypothesis cannot be logically inferred from the premise because the hypothesis states the opposite of the premise. step 3: based on the logical reasoning, there is no way for the hypothesis to be inferred from the premise."
3853,Even when these sights are bustling with visitors you're likely to find them compelling.,You are likely to be attracted to them.,1,1,True,"step 1: in the premise, 'them' refers to 'these sights' which are described as 'bustling with visitors' but still compelling. 'compelling' means having the power to attract, interest, or impress. step 2: the hypothesis 'you are likely to be attracted to them' directly relates to the premise as it also suggests the likelihood of being attracted to these sights. since the premise states that these sights are compelling regardless of the number of visitors, it implies that the attractiveness of the sights is a consistent trait. therefore, the hypothesis can be logically inferred from the premise. step 3: based on the logical connection between the premise and hypothesis, and the consistent meaning of the terms used, the hypothesis is entailed by the premise."
3854,Daniel Nestor and Édouard Roger - Vasselin were the defending champions.,"Daniel Nestor and Édouard Roger-Vasselin were the defending champions, but chose not to compete together.",1,0,False,"step 1: in the premise, daniel nestor and édouard roger-vasselin are identified as the defending champions. this means they were the winners in the previous tournament. step 2: the hypothesis adds an additional detail that they chose not to compete together. this does not contradict the information in the premise but rather provides additional context about how they defended their title. it is common for defending champions to not compete together, especially if one retires, gets injured, or focuses on other things. step 3: given that the premise and hypothesis do not contradict each other, and the hypothesis is a plausible scenario, it can be considered that the hypothesis can be logically inferred from the premise, although it may require additional context or assumptions. however, it is important to note that the premise and hypothesis are not identical. while the premise states that they were the defending champions, the hypothesis adds the condition that they did not compete together. therefore, the hypothesis is not strictly entailed by the premise, but rather related in the sense that the hypothesis is a possible scenario given the premise. step 4: based on the above analysis, it can be concluded that the hypothesis is related to the premise, but it is not strictly entailed by it. therefore, the label should be '0'."
3855,"Mauricio Vivero, a spokesman for the organization, said Subia made a great impression on everyone at the meetings.",Subia made a horrible impression on the people.,0,0,True,"step 1: the premise states that mauricio vivero, a spokesman for the organization, made a statement about subia making a great impression on everyone at the meetings. this implies that subia's behavior or demeanor was well-received by the people present. step 2: the hypothesis suggests an opposite situation - subia making a horrible impression. this contradicts the premise as there is no indication in the premise that subia made a horrible impression, and the hypothesis does not logically follow from the premise. step 3: based on the given information, the hypothesis cannot be inferred from the premise."
3856,"It stands next to the arcaded and half-timbered Broletto, 13th-century seat of municipal government.",It is found three miles west of the Broletto.,0,0,True,"step 1: in the premise, 'it' refers to a specific location or object, which is described as being next to the broletto, an ancient municipal government building. the broletto is identified as a 13th-century structure, providing a historical context. no other significant details are provided in the premise.step 2: the hypothesis states that 'it' is found three miles west of the broletto. this information contradicts the location mentioned in the premise, as 'it' is described as being next to the broletto, not three miles away.step 3: based on the logical analysis, the hypothesis cannot be logically inferred from the premise as it contradicts the information provided in the premise."
3857,"For fiscal year 2002, VBA revised its performance plans for the senior executives in the regional offices to improve individual accountability for performance elements by linking organizational performance goals and actual performance with meaningful and measurable performance elements.",VBA added new goals to the performance plan.,1,1,True,"step 1: in the premise, vba (veterans benefits administration) is stated to have revised its performance plans for the senior executives in the regional offices for fiscal year 2002. this revision was aimed at improving individual accountability for performance elements by linking organizational performance goals and actual performance with meaningful and measurable performance elements. step 2: the hypothesis suggests that new goals were added to the performance plan. this is a reasonable inference given the context of the premise. revising performance plans often involves adding new goals to align with changing organizational objectives or to address new performance expectations. step 3: based on the logical connection between the premise and hypothesis, and the common sense understanding that performance plan revisions often involve adding new goals, the hypothesis can be inferred from the premise.step 4: it is also important to note that the premise does not contradict the hypothesis, as it does not explicitly state that no new goals were added during the revision process."
3858,Many users commented on the effectiveness of the new technology in promoting closer relationships among providers.,They were disappointed to hear the consumer complaints.,0,0,True,"step 1: in the premise, 'many users' have commented on the effectiveness of a new technology in enhancing relationships among providers. this implies a positive assessment of the technology. step 2. the hypothesis suggests a contrasting emotion, 'disappointment'. however, there is no explicit indication in the premise that users were disappointed, only that they commented. step 3: the hypothesis is not logically entailed by the premise. the premise does not provide sufficient evidence to infer that the users were disappointed. it is possible for users to express disappointment in the context of consumer complaints, but it is also possible for them to express disappointment for other reasons or for the technology to still be effective despite some complaints. step 4: it is important to note that correlation does not imply causation. the fact that there were consumer complaints does not necessarily mean that users were disappointed with the technology's effectiveness in promoting closer relationships among providers. therefore, the hypothesis cannot be logically inferred from the premise."
3859,"The famed Harvard sociobiologist argues that all phenomena--art, economics, science--can be understood by studying the brain's neural pathways.",The Harvard sociologist says all phenomena can be understood by studying the brain in a cat scan.,1,0,False,"step 1. in the premise, the harvard sociobiologist is stated to argue that all phenomena can be understood by studying the brain's neural pathways. this suggests a focus on the neural structure and function of the brain. step 2. the hypothesis proposes that the harvard sociologist claims all phenomena can be understood by studying the brain 'in a cat scan'. while the hypothesis is related to the premise, it is not a direct logical inference. studying the brain in a cat scan is a specific method for observing the brain, not the general study of neural pathways. step 3. therefore, the hypothesis cannot be logically inferred from the premise as the hypothesis proposes a more specific and limited method for studying the brain than what is stated in the premise."
3860,"In about 1952, the company was acquired by Bankers Securities Corporation, owned by Albert M. Greenfield.","In about 1952, the company was acquired by Bankers Securities Corporation, owned by Albert M. Greenfield, but remained family run until its closure in 1962.",1,0,False,"step 1: the premise states that the company was acquired by bankers securities corporation, which was owned by albert m. greenfield around 1952. no information is provided regarding the operational control or management structure of the company post-acquisition. step 2: the hypothesis adds a new piece of information stating that the company remained family run until its closure in 1962, despite being acquired by bankers securities corporation. step 3: there is no contradiction between the premise and hypothesis based on the information provided. however, the hypothesis is not logically entailed by the premise. the premise does not state or imply that the company remained family-run after the acquisition. without further context or information, it is impossible to logically infer the hypothesis from the premise."
3861,"That you, Hersheimmer? ",It may not be Hersheimmer.,1,0,False,"step 1: in the premise, a question is asked to confirm if 'hersheimmer' is being referred to. this is a simple yes or no question. the hypothesis introduces an uncertainty, suggesting that 'hersheimmer' might not be the correct identification. step 2: given that the premise does not provide sufficient context or information to logically infer the hypothesis, the hypothesis cannot be logically derived from the premise. step 3: based on the premise and hypothesis provided, there is no entailment relationship."
3862,Brian Dennehy in Death of a Salesman .-- Chris Kelly,Chris Kelly does not mention Death of a Salesman. ,0,0,True,"step 1: brian dennehy is an actor, and death of a salesman is a play written by arthur miller. in this context, the premise refers to brian dennehy's role in the play. chris kelly is a different person. step 2: the hypothesis states that chris kelly does not mention death of a salesman. this information is not provided in the premise, so there is no logical relationship between the two statements. step 3: based on the lack of a logical connection and the fact that the hypothesis contradicts the possible implicit assumption that all information relevant to brian dennehy's role in death of a salesman is included in the premise, the hypothesis is not entailed by the premise.step 4: it is important to note that the premise does not explicitly state that chris kelly is mentioned in death of a salesman, but it also does not state that he is not. the hypothesis goes beyond the information given in the premise, and makes a claim about the absence of specific information. in general, the absence of information cannot be logically inferred from the presence of other information.step 5: in summary, the hypothesis 'chris kelly does not mention death of a salesman' is not entailed by the premise 'brian dennehy in death of a salesman', as the two statements are logically unrelated."
3863,"In a country of crowded cities, it makes a refreshing change to travel 37 km (22 miles) southwest to an outcrop on which stands the citadel of Fatehpur Sikri, briefly Akbar's imperial capital.",There are not a lot of people in the cities.,0,1,False,"step 1: the premise describes a country with crowded cities, yet it also mentions traveling to a less crowded place, fatehpur sikri. this implies that there are indeed crowded cities in the country but there are also places, like fatehpur sikri, where the population density is lower.step 2: the hypothesis states 'there are not a lot of people in the cities.' this is consistent with the information in the premise that traveling from the crowded cities to fatehpur sikri is a refreshing change due to the lower population. the hypothesis can be inferred as a logical consequence of the premise.step 3: based on the logical connection between the premise and hypothesis, and the absence of contradictory information, the hypothesis can be inferred from the premise."
3864,(Kohler's Dictionary for Accountants).,An Accountants' Dictionary by Kohler's,1,1,True,"step 1. in the premise, kohler's dictionary for accountants is identified as a specific type of dictionary. no additional information is provided about the content or scope of the dictionary. step 2. the hypothesis, an accountants' dictionary by kohler's, is identical to the given premise in all significant details. therefore, the hypothesis can be logically inferred from the premise since the hypothesis is a more specific version of the premise. step 3. based on the logical equivalence of the hypothesis and the premise, the hypothesis is entailed by the premise."
3865,"About five minutes away in the unspoiled countryside, you'll jolt over the 200 rockiest yards of road in Martinique to get to the Musee de la Pagerie.",The road in Martinique is totally smooth.,0,0,True,"step 1. in the premise, it is mentioned that the road to the musee de la pagerie in martinique is 'rockiest yards' and 'jolt over'. these descriptions imply that the road is not smooth. step 2. the hypothesis, 'the road in martinique is totally smooth', contradicts the information from the premise. step 3. based on the given information, the hypothesis 'the road in martinique is totally smooth' cannot be inferred from the premise."
3866,sacrifice that that would be to suddenly try to switch over to all CDs or something but i know one thing that has colored my music choice is,My record collection is huge and full of rare ones.,1,1,True,"step 1: in the premise, the speaker is discussing their music collection and the influence of certain factors on its composition. they mention the idea of switching to cds but then clarify that they have been influenced by having a large and rare record collection. step 2: the hypothesis suggests that the speaker's record collection is extensive and consists of rare records. this information aligns with the premise, as it explains the reason for the speaker's music choices and their collection being described as 'huge and full of rare ones'. step 3: given the logical connection between the premise and hypothesis, and the fact that the hypothesis does not contradict the premise in any way, it can be inferred that the hypothesis is a logical consequence of the premise.step 4: the premise does not necessarily entail that all records are rare or that the speaker only collects records. however, the hypothesis does not contradict this either. it only adds to the detail of the information presented in the premise and provides an explanation for the speaker's music preferences.step 5: based on the information given, the hypothesis is a reasonable and logical inference from the premise. the premise leaves room for the implication that the speaker has a large and rare record collection, and the hypothesis explicitly states this.step 6: in conclusion, the hypothesis can be inferred from the premise, and the logical connection between the two is based on the information presented and the common-sense understanding of the context."
3867,"The Casa Grande of the Stronghold was a high-ceilinged, five-room building about sixty feet long, the kitchen making a right angle to the other rooms and joining the smoke house to form part of another wall for the patio.",The Casa Grande is the most beautiful structure in the Stronghold.,1,0,False,"step 1: in the premise, the casa grande is described as a five-room building with a high ceiling and a length of about sixty feet. it has a right-angled kitchen that joins the smoke house, forming part of another wall for the patio. no information is given about the appearance, beauty, or other structures within the stronghold. step 2: the hypothesis makes a subjective claim about the casa grande being the most beautiful structure in the stronghold, which cannot be logically inferred from the given information. the premise only describes the physical characteristics of the casa grande, and there is no information about its appearance or the appearance of other structures in the stronghold. step 3: based on the given information, the hypothesis cannot be logically inferred from the premise."
3868,The film was selected as the Burkinabé entry for the Best Foreign Language Film at the 62nd Academy Awards.,"The film was selected as the Burkinabé entry for the Best Foreign Language Film at the 62nd Academy Awards, but was not accepted as a nominee.",1,0,False,"step 1: in the premise, the film is identified as the burkinabé entry for the best foreign language film at the 62nd academy awards. this indicates that the film was initially considered for nomination in this category. step 2: the hypothesis states that the film was selected as the entry but was not accepted as a nominee. this implies that the film was initially chosen to represent burkina faso in the awards, but ultimately did not advance to the nominee stage. step 3: although the premise and hypothesis share the same initial condition (the film being the burkinabé entry), they differ in their conclusions (being a nominee versus not being a nominee). since the premise does not guarantee or logically imply the hypothesis, they are not logically equivalent. therefore, the hypothesis cannot be logically inferred from the premise. step 4: it's important to note that not being able to logically infer a hypothesis from a premise does not mean that the hypothesis is false. it simply means that the premise does not provide enough information to determine the truth or falsehood of the hypothesis."
3869,"If you have the energy to climb the 387 steps to the top of the south tower, you will be rewarded with a stunning view over the city.",There are 400 steps to the top of the south tower.,0,1,False,"step 1: the premise describes a scenario where climbing the 387 steps of the south tower leads to a rewarding view of the city. the number of steps does not affect the reward itself or the ability to reach it. step 2: the hypothesis suggests a difference of 13 steps between the number stated in the premise and the number given in the hypothesis. this difference is not significant enough to contradict the premise or alter the core meaning. step 3: while the hypothesis is not identical to the premise, it does not contradict it either. the difference in the number of steps does not change the essential information provided in the premise - that climbing the tower will reward you with a view over the city. therefore, the hypothesis can still be logically inferred from the premise, albeit with a slight modification due to the difference in the number of steps.step 4: it is important to note that this conclusion is based on the assumption that the difference in the number of steps does not affect the climbing experience or the reward. if the difference of 13 steps implies a significant change in the climbing experience, the conclusion might be different.step 5: in summary, given the information provided, the hypothesis 'there are 400 steps to the top of the south tower' can be inferred from the premise 'if you have the energy to climb the 387 steps to the top of the south tower, you will be rewarded with a stunning view over the city'."
3870,yeah that's they yeah kind of cheating isn't it,You're doing something wrong. ,1,1,True,"step 1: in the premise, the speaker expresses a viewpoint that cheating isn't right. this implies a moral judgment and a shared understanding of what constitutes cheating.step 2: the hypothesis, 'you're doing something wrong,' can be logically inferred from the premise, as the statement 'cheating isn't right' implies that doing something wrong is inappropriate or against the rules. the hypothesis is a more general observation about the situation, and it is a reasonable inference based on the information in the premise.step 3: based on the logical reasoning and the shared understanding of moral judgments and wrongdoings, the hypothesis is entailed by the premise."
3871,"However, a reminder of the historic reality of the Indian Mutiny at Lucknow is also ever-present.",There are no longer any reminders of the mutiny.,0,0,True,"step 1: in the premise, it is mentioned that there is a reminder of the historic reality of the indian mutiny at lucknow. this implies that there exists some form of physical or symbolic representation of the mutiny in that location. step 2: the hypothesis contradicts the premise, stating that there are 'no longer any reminders' of the mutiny. step 3: based on the given information, the hypothesis cannot be logically inferred from the premise as it contradicts it."

3877,"It has two Auditoria, the first of which is a traditional Theatre which can hold 667 people.","It was designed by the Architect Sir Frederick Gibberd and has two Auditoria, the first of which is a traditional Theatre which can hold 667 people.",1,1,True,"step 1. the premise and hypothesis both agree that there is a building with two auditoria, and that one of them is a traditional theatre with a capacity of 667 people. no contradictory information is present.step 2. the hypothesis adds the information that the building was designed by architect sir frederick gibberd. this information does not contradict the premise and can be considered as additional, non-essential information.step 3. the hypothesis can be inferred from the premise because it does not contradict it and the additional information does not alter the logical relationship between the premise and hypothesis."
3878,Newsweek --what a coincidence!,"Wow, Newsweek did it too!",1,0,False,"step 1: in the given premise, 'newsweek -- what a coincidence!' implies that there is an unexpected or unlikely occurrence related to newsweek. the exact nature of this coincidence is not specified.step 2: the hypothesis, 'wow, newsweek did it too!' suggests a similar coincidental occurrence where newsweek is involved in a situation or event that was also unexpected or unlikely.  while the hypothesis is related to the premise in terms of its topic (newsweek), it does not logically follow from the premise as there is no information in the premise that newsweek has been involved in the same coincidence.step 3: based on the given information, the hypothesis cannot be logically inferred from the premise. there is no entailment."
3879,All her friends spoke of her as Rita.,Her friends called her Rita because it is short for Margarita.,1,0,False,"step 1: in the premise, it is stated that 'all her friends spoke of her as rita'. this indicates that rita is a name by which her friends know her. the premise does not provide any information about why rita is called by that name. step 2: the hypothesis suggests that rita might be called rita because it is a short form of margarita. this is an explanation for why rita might be named that way. step 3: while the hypothesis goes beyond the information provided in the premise, it does not contradict it. if 'rita' is indeed a name that is commonly used to refer to 'margarita', then both statements are consistent. in fact, the hypothesis could provide additional context and information that helps explain why rita is called that name. step 4: in logical terms, the hypothesis is an instance of a more general statement that could be inferred from the premise, namely that there is some reason why rita is called rita. logically, such a statement does not follow directly from the premise, but it is a reasonable inference based on common knowledge and the context provided. step 5: based on the given information, logical principles, and common-sense reasoning, the hypothesis is plausible and could be a valid inference from the premise, even though it is not strictly entailed by it."
3880,..most guys want it on the outside.,Women want it on the inside.,1,0,False,"step 1: in the premise, 'it' refers to something that most guys want 'on the outside.' this suggests an external desire or preference. the context does not provide enough information to determine the exact nature of 'it.' step 2: in contrast, the hypothesis states that 'women want it on the inside.' this implies a desire or preference for something internal. the hypothesis makes no reference to 'most women' or any specific group, and it does not indicate that this internal desire is the opposite of what men want. step 3: the hypothesis is not logically entailed by the premise, as they express different desires for different groups. the premise describes a preference of most guys, while the hypothesis describes a preference of women. there is no logical connection between the two statements."

3886,"Route time is the time it would take a carrier to walk or drive the route, passing, but not accessing, any delivery point. ",Route time is calculated in mileage ,1,1,True,"step 1: the premise defines route time as the time it takes a carrier to traverse a route, bypassing any delivery points. it does not mention any specific method for calculating this time. common sense suggests that calculating time based on mileage is a common practice for determining travel times in various modes of transportation, including routes taken by carriers. step 2: the hypothesis proposes that route time is calculated based on mileage. this can be logically inferred from the premise since the premise does not specify how the route time is actually measured or calculated, and it is a reasonable assumption based on common practices. step 3: based on the logical reasoning and lack of contradictory information in the premise, the hypothesis can be inferred from the premise."
3887,and i don't know about your part of the country but uh down here in the last year oh year plus i it was last beginning with last year's Earth Day,I've never been to your part of the country.,1,0,False,"step 1: in the premise, the speaker mentions that 'down here' in their location, something happened beginning with last year's earth day. this is a specific description of an event or series of events in the speaker's location. the hypothesis, on the other hand, is a statement about the speaker's personal experience.step 2: the hypothesis and the premise are not related to each other in a logical way. the premise does not contain enough information to infer or deduce the hypothesis. the hypothesis is about the speaker's lack of experience in a certain part of the country, whereas the premise is about an event or series of events in that location.step 3: based on the given information, the hypothesis cannot be logically inferred from the premise."
3888,"Stow it, said Number 14.",Number 14 was silent.,0,0,True,"step 1: the premise is a statement of a command given by number 14 to 'stow it'. it does not provide any information about number 14's speech before or after the command. step 2: the hypothesis suggests that number 14 was silent at some point before or after the command. however, there is no information in the premise that contradicts or implies this hypothesis. step 3: the hypothesis is not logically entailed by the premise, as the premise does not provide enough context to infer number 14's silence. therefore, the hypothesis cannot be inferred from the premise."
3889,"In criticizing the ability of the exclusionary rule to reverse a conviction, he  The wrong done was the search, not the conviction.",Searching through the book was the wrong doing.,1,1,True,"step 1: in the premise, the person is criticizing the ability of the exclusionary rule to reverse a conviction. the 'wrong done' in this context is the search that led to the evidence used in the conviction. this is clear from the text.step 2: the hypothesis is stating that 'searching through the book' was the wrong doing. while the hypothesis is not directly mentioned in the premise, it can be inferred from the premise indirectly. the reason is that the premise is discussing a search that led to the wrongful evidence being obtained, and the hypothesis suggests that this search was the issue. therefore, the hypothesis is related to the premise, and the premise provides context for understanding the hypothesis.step 3: based on the logical relationship between the premise and hypothesis, and the absence of contradictory information, the hypothesis can be inferred from the premise. the hypothesis is not a direct logical consequence of the premise, but it is a reasonable conclusion that can be drawn from the premise."
3890,A 1997 Henry J. Kaiser Family Foundation survey found that Americans in managed care plans are basically content with their own care.,The henry kaiser foundation shows that people hate their healthcare,0,0,True,"step 1: in the premise, the henry j. kaiser family foundation is described as having found that americans in managed care plans are content with their own care. this implies that there was a survey conducted by the foundation with a specific outcome. step 2: the hypothesis, on the other hand, claims that the henry j. kaiser foundation 'shows' that people hate their healthcare. this is a significant difference. the word 'shows' implies that there is some direct evidence, probably in the form of data, that the foundation has published to support this claim. however, the premise makes no mention of such evidence. step 3: based on the information provided in the premise, it is not logically possible to infer the hypothesis. the premise describes the outcome of a survey, but it does not indicate that the survey found that people hate their healthcare. in fact, it suggests the opposite. therefore, the hypothesis cannot be inferred from the premise."
3891,um is that typical to only breed them once,i thought they needed to be bred twice.,1,0,False,"step 1: the premise is about the typical number of breeding instances for um. no specific number is given, but it implies that once is the norm. the hypothesis states that the belief is that they need to be bred twice.step 2: the hypothesis contradicts the premise if 'they' refers to a specific breed of animal called 'um'. if the hypothesis is correct, then it would not be typical for 'um' to be bred only once. however, without further context or specific information about 'um', it is not possible to definitively determine if the hypothesis is true or false. it is also important to note that breeding practices can vary widely among different species and breeds.step 3: based on the given information, the hypothesis cannot be logically inferred from the premise. the premise describes the typical number of breeding instances for 'um', but it does not necessarily imply that breeding them twice is impossible or abnormal. therefore, the hypothesis goes beyond the given information and requires additional context or facts to be verified."
3892,It was changed when the director said that would not work in the movie.,"It was originally written with an Indian theme, but was changed when the director said that would not work in the movie.",1,1,True,"step 1: in the premise, it is stated that 'it' was changed when the director said 'that would not work in the movie'. the specifics of 'it' are not mentioned, but the context implies that 'it' refers to some aspect of the movie. step 2: the hypothesis proposes that 'it' originally had an indian theme, which was changed. this is a reasonable inference based on the information in the premise, as the reason for the change is not specified and an indian theme is a common aspect of movies that can be changed. step 3: the hypothesis is consistent with the premise, as the premise does not contradict the hypothesis, and the hypothesis provides additional information that can be logically inferred from the premise. step 4: based on the logical reasoning and common sense, the hypothesis is entailed by the premise."
3893,and you know like he sent planes over to to shoot the people down that were on the border with uh that that were on their way to Turkey,I'm glad he decided not to send planes anywhere near Turkey. ,0,1,False,"step 1: in the premise, it is stated that someone sent planes to shoot people on the border with syria, which was on their way to turkey. this implies a potentially volatile or hostile situation. step 2: the hypothesis expresses relief that no planes were sent near turkey. this can be seen as an inference drawn from the premise, as the hypothesis avoids the potential conflict or danger that could have arisen from the premise. step 3: based on this logic, the hypothesis can be inferred from the premise, as it is a safer or more peaceful alternative to the scenario presented in the premise.step 4: it's important to note that while the hypothesis can be inferred from the premise, it doesn't necessarily mean that the hypothesis is a factual or definitive outcome. the hypothesis only suggests that no planes were sent near turkey based on the given premise.step 5: it's also important to consider the context and underlying intentions of the speaker who provided the premise and hypothesis. in this example, the premise seems to be presented as a hypothetical or historical situation, which allows for the inference of the hypothesis. in real-world situations, there may be additional context or factors that could influence the relationship between a premise and hypothesis."
3894,"We at the Bureau have the most exciting and satisfying jobs in the world, said Joseph, the Bureau's executive director. ",John is the Bureau's executive director.,0,1,False,"step 1: in the premise, joseph is identified as the executive director of the bureau. step 2: the hypothesis, 'john is the bureau's executive director', is equivalent to stating 'john = joseph' in terms of their roles in the organization. since the premise states that joseph holds this position, it follows that john must also hold the same position for them to be equal. step 3: based on the logical equivalence between 'joseph' and 'john' in the context of the bureau's executive director role, the hypothesis can be inferred from the premise."
3895,A man in a green apron smiles behind a food stand.,A woman in blue buys food.,0,0,True,"step 1: in the premise, a man who is wearing a green apron and is smiling is described behind a food stand. this scenario suggests a setting where food is being sold. there are no logical inconsistencies or contradictions in the premise. step 2: the hypothesis introduces a new entity, a woman in blue, and an action, buying food. however, the premise does not provide any information about who is buying food or even if anyone is buying food besides the implication that food is being sold. step 3: based on the given information, the hypothesis 'a woman in blue buys food' cannot be logically inferred from the premise 'a man in a green apron smiles behind a food stand'. the premise does not provide sufficient context or information to support the hypothesis."
3896,Every once in a while they gits together an' makes war talk.,They sometimes get together in town and talk of forming a war party.,1,1,True,"step 1: in the premise, 'they' refers to native americans or a specific tribe, and 'they gits together an' makes war talk' implies a gathering or meeting where they discuss or plan for war. this is a common way for tribes to make decisions and prepare for conflict.step 2: the hypothesis suggests that 'they' get together in town and 'talk of forming a war party'. this is similar to the premise as both describe a gathering and discussing military actions. the fact that it occurs in town does not contradict the premise as there is no specific location stated in the premise.step 3: based on the similarity in meaning and logical consistency between the premise and hypothesis, the hypothesis can be inferred from the premise. both statements describe a gathering and discussions related to war, which are logically connected."
3897,"In effect, Nixon's misdeeds () so dwarf Clinton's--even the most severe charges of suborning perjury--that Republicans could wind up bollixed.",In effect Clinton's sins are greater than Nixon's.,0,0,True,"step 1: in the premise, the speaker compares the misdeeds of nixon and clinton, suggesting that nixon's misdeeds are more severe. this implies that clinton's misdeeds are less severe in comparison. step 2: the hypothesis states that clinton's sins are greater than nixon's, which is the opposite of what is stated in the premise. step 3: based on the information provided, the hypothesis cannot be logically inferred from the premise, as the premise states the opposite."
3898,we usually don't uh we usually don't have very cold weather down here you know during uh during football season it it gets colder later on in the season,We live much closer to the equator than most other football players.,1,0,False,"step 1: the premise describes the typical weather patterns during football season in the given location. it states that weather is generally not very cold during this time, but gets colder later in the season. step 2: the hypothesis suggests that the location is much closer to the equator than most other places where football is played. step 3: the hypothesis does not logically follow from the premise. the weather pattern described in the premise does not directly provide information about the geographic location. it's possible to have mild weather during football season in places that are far from the equator, and it's also possible to have cold weather in places closer to the equator. common sense tells us that there are many places around the world where football is played, and they have various climate conditions. therefore, the hypothesis is not entailed by the premise."
3899,The act requires that the National Institute of Standards and Technology develop standards and guidelines for computer systems to control loss and unauthorized modification or disclosure of sensitive information and to prevent computer-related fraud and misuse.,The computer systems should all be modified without authorization.,0,0,True,"step 1: in the premise, it is stated that the national institute of standards and technology (nist) is required to develop standards and guidelines for computer systems to secure sensitive information and prevent computer-related fraud and misuse. this implies that there is a need for control and security measures in computer systems to protect against loss, unauthorized modification, and disclosure.step 2: the hypothesis proposes the opposite of what is stated in the premise, suggesting all computer systems should be modified without authorization. this directly contradicts the requirements outlined in the premise, as unauthorized modifications go against the very control and security measures the premise is advocating for.step 3: based on the logical contradiction between the premise and hypothesis, it is clear that the hypothesis cannot be inferred from the premise. the hypothesis proposes a situation that directly goes against the requirements and objectives stated in the premise."
3900,"Really, I can't tell you. ","They won't let me tell you, there's something I need to keep secret from absolutely everybody under ever circumstance.",1,0,False,"step 1: the premise is a statement of uncertainty and ambiguity, it does not provide any clear or definite information that can be used to logically infer the hypothesis. the hypothesis, on the other hand, states a strong and specific reason for the speaker's inability to share information. step 2: the hypothesis contradicts the premise in the sense that it suggests a definite reason for the speaker's secrecy, whereas the premise leaves the reason open. no logical connection can be established between the two. step 3: based on the given information, the hypothesis is not entailed by the premise."
3901,oh yeah he's very he uh of course he he's dead now seems like most of the good ones are,His death was actually an internet hoax.,0,0,True,"step 1: in the premise, the speaker is expressing regret that 'most of the good ones are dead now', which implies that they are people who were once alive but are now deceased. the hypothesis, on the other hand, suggests that one of these deceased individuals' death was a hoax.step 2: the hypothesis contradicts the premise, as it asserts that a reported death was not actual, while the premise states that the person is now deceased. this contradiction makes it impossible for the hypothesis to be logically inferred from the premise.step 3: based on the logical reasoning, the hypothesis is not entailed by the premise."
3902,Can't she do with it what she will?,Can't she do anything with the recycled paper? ,1,0,False,"step 1: in the premise, 'it' refers to a specific object, but it is not clear what that object is. the question is asking about the ability of 'she' to do something with 'it'. in the hypothesis, 'it' also refers to an object, but this time, it's specified as 'recycled paper'. however, there's no clear indication in the premise that 'it' is recycled paper. step 2: logically, the hypothesis cannot be directly inferred from the premise because the premise does not provide enough information to deduce that the object in question is recycled paper. step 3: based on the information given, there is no entailment relationship between the premise and the hypothesis."
3903,"However, many Hawaiians were opposed to surrendering their sovereignty.",Many Hawaiians agreed with surrending their soveregnty.,0,0,True,"step 1: in the premise, it is stated that 'many hawaiians were opposed' to surrendering their sovereignty. this implies that there was a significant number of hawaiians who held this view. common sense and historical context suggest that opposing the surrender of sovereignty likely indicates strong feelings of cultural attachment and pride.step 2: the hypothesis, 'many hawaiians agreed with surrendering their sovereignty,' directly contradicts the information in the premise. agreeing with surrendering sovereignty would mean supporting the relinquishment of their political power and self-governance.step 3: based on the information identified in step 1 and the logical contradiction between the premise and hypothesis, it is clear that the hypothesis is not entailed by the premise. the premise and hypothesis present conflicting information."
3904,"Finally, the analysis states that the FCC is unaware of any other alternatives which could provide sufficient spectrum in the immediate future but invites comments on this point.","Dozens of other alternatives are stated in the analysis, each with excellent ability to provide spectrum. ",0,0,True,"step 1: in the premise, the fcc is stated to be unaware of any alternatives other than those currently being considered, which can provide sufficient spectrum in the immediate future. this implies a limited scope of available options. step 2: the hypothesis, however, suggests that dozens of alternatives exist and each one has the potential to provide adequate spectrum. this directly contradicts the information provided in the premise. step 3: based on the logical analysis, the hypothesis cannot be reasonably inferred from the premise as it presents new information that contradicts the given facts."
3905,"Correct, said Jon.",Jon said you were correct about the incoming storm.,1,1,True,"step 1: the premise states that jon said 'correct' in response to a statement about the incoming storm. this implies that jon agreed with the statement. step 2: the hypothesis suggests that jon's agreement was about the accuracy of a statement regarding the incoming storm. given that the premise describes jon agreeing to a statement about the storm, the hypothesis is a logical consequence. step 3: based on the given information, the hypothesis is entailed by the premise because jon's agreement can be reasonably inferred to be about the incoming storm."
3906,"To keep growing, it will have to win over new users who may be tempted by easier-to-use hand-held devices and specialized e-mail and Internet machines.",it will not have to win any users.,0,0,True,"step 1: in the premise, it is stated that 'it' (implicitly referring to a specific entity, such as a business or a product) needs to win over new users to keep growing. this implies that there is competition and potential alternatives for users, which could be hand-held devices, e-mail and internet machines.step 2: the hypothesis states that 'it will not have to win any users'. this is a direct contradiction to the information stated in the premise. if 'it' does not have to win any users, then it does not need to compete or address potential alternatives for users.step 3: based on the logical reasoning, the hypothesis cannot be inferred from the premise as it contradicts the information provided in the premise."
3907,"Of the few remains of the Byzantine city, the most remarkable building is the Haghia Sophia.",The Hagia Sophia is a large and beautiful church that has been used by both Christians and Muslims.,1,1,True,"step 1: in the premise, the haghia sophia is identified as the most remarkable building among the few remains of the byzantine city. no specific information is given about the nature or use of the building. step 2: the hypothesis provides additional information about the haghia sophia being a large and beautiful church. this description is consistent with the premise as a remarkable building could be described as large and beautiful. the hypothesis also states that the church has been used by both christians and muslims. step 3: the use of the haghia sophia by both christians and muslims is not directly stated in the premise, but it is a well-known historical fact about the building. this information can be inferred as the haghia sophia's status as a remarkable building does not change regardless of its religious significance. therefore, the hypothesis can be logically inferred from the premise.step 4: the hypothesis is an expansion of the given information in the premise, providing additional details and context.step 5: based on the logical reasoning, the given historical facts, and the consistency of the descriptions, the hypothesis can be inferred from the premise."
3908,"Alfred Wainwright, prominent fell walker and writer, was curator here for many years.","The curator, Alfred Wainwright held exquisite parties every fall.",1,0,False,"step 1: from the premise, we know that alfred wainwright was a prominent fell walker and writer, and he served as a curator for 'many years'. this information does not provide any direct evidence regarding wainwright's party habits. step 2: the hypothesis suggests that the curator, alfred wainwright, held 'exquisite parties every fall'. this information is not logically inferred from the premise as there is no mention of parties, either explicitly or implicitly, in the premise. step 3: based on the given information, we cannot infer that alfred wainwright held exquisite parties every fall from the premise."
3909,No one does believe it.,"I, however, think it has some merit.",1,0,False,"step 1: in the premise, 'no one does believe it' implies that there is a statement or claim that is currently not accepted or acknowledged by everyone. it does not provide any specific information about the nature or validity of this claim. in the hypothesis, 'i, however, think it has some merit' expresses an opinion that the speaker holds about the unbelieved claim.step 2: the hypothesis does not logically follow from the premise as the premise neither confirms nor denies the validity of the claim in question. the speaker's opinion in the hypothesis is not entailed by the information provided in the premise.step 3: based on the given information, the hypothesis cannot be logically inferred from the premise."
3910,"It is descended from the Brahmi script via the Gupta script and later evolved into the Assamese alphabet, the Bengali alphabet, and the Tibetan alphabet.","It is descended from the Brahmi script via the Lopez script and later evolved into the Assamese alphabet, the Bengali alphabet, and the Tibetan alphabet.",0,0,True,"step 1: the premise states that the script in question is descended from the brahmi script via the gupta script and later evolved into assamese, bengali, and tibetan alphabets. this implies a historical relationship between these scripts. step 2: the hypothesis suggests an alternative, but related, historical path with the lopez script instead of the gupta script. however, there is no information provided in the premise or common knowledge to suggest that the lopez script is a part of the historical development of the script in question. step 3: based on the given information, the hypothesis cannot be logically inferred from the premise as the premise does not support the hypothesis."
3911,"Each individual's survival curve, or the probability of surviving beyond a given age, should shift as a result of an environmental quality improvement.",People will live longer if they get plenty of fresh air.,1,1,True,"step 1: in the premise, it is stated that individual survival curves can shift due to environmental quality improvements. this implies that changes in the environment can influence an individual's chances of surviving beyond a certain age. step 2: the hypothesis suggests that getting plenty of fresh air can lead to people living longer, which is a specific environmental condition. it is a well-established fact that clean air is beneficial for health and longevity. step 3: given this context, the hypothesis can be logically inferred from the premise as an example of an environmental quality improvement that can lead to a shift in individual survival curves. step 4: the hypothesis is consistent with the common sense understanding that good air quality is essential for maintaining good health and increasing the chances of survival."
3912,beneficiaries by more than $3.,There are no beneficiaries.,0,0,True,"step 1: in the premise, 'beneficiaries' are mentioned as receiving an amount that exceeds $3. this statement does not provide any information about the number or existence of beneficiaries, only their financial status. step 2: the hypothesis, 'there are no beneficiaries', is a direct contradiction of the premise, which states that there are beneficiaries. step 3: since the hypothesis contradicts the premise, it cannot be logically inferred from the premise.step 4: it's important to note that the lack of information in the premise regarding the number of beneficiaries does not allow for the hypothesis to be entailed. in other words, the absence of information about the number of beneficiaries in the premise does not make the hypothesis 'there are no beneficiaries' a logical consequence of the premise.step 5: therefore, based on the logical reasoning and the clear contradiction between the two statements, the hypothesis 'there are no beneficiaries' is not entailed by the premise."
3913,"If so, there will be danger.","Nah, there won't be danger.",0,0,True,"step 1: in the premise, 'if so' implies a conditional statement, but it does not provide any specific information about the condition or the danger. it only sets up a potential relationship between 'so' and 'danger'. step 2: the hypothesis directly contradicts the premise, as 'nah, there won't be danger' negates the potential danger mentioned in the premise. however, the hypothesis itself does not provide any logical connection or entailment to the premise. step 3: based on the given information, the hypothesis cannot be logically inferred from the premise as they contradict each other."
3914,"However, they had to protect the shipping lanes in order to get their treasure home, and this meant keeping hold of as much of the Caribbean (or the  Spanish Main,  as it was then known) as possible.",Shipping lanes had no protection and never will.,0,0,True,"step 1. the premise describes a historical context where protecting shipping lanes was crucial for treasures to be brought home, and the caribbean was held to ensure their safety. step 2. the hypothesis states that shipping lanes had no protection and never will. this contradicts the premise as it suggests a continuous lack of protection throughout history which is not indicated in the premise. step 3. based on the given information, the hypothesis cannot be logically inferred from the premise as it contradicts it."
3915,Some agencies are beginning to use more proactive mechanisms for alerting the interested public about impending regulatory actions and opportunities for participation.,Some agencies are beginning to use less proactive mechanisms for alerting the interested public.,0,0,True,"step 1: the premise states that some agencies are using more proactive mechanisms for alerting the public about regulatory actions and opportunities for participation. this implies that these agencies are taking an initiative to keep the public informed. step 2: the hypothesis suggests that some agencies are using less proactive mechanisms for alerting the public. this would mean that these agencies are not taking an active role in informing the public, but instead relying on less direct or timely methods. step  3: the hypothesis contradicts the premise as it suggests that some agencies are moving in the opposite direction of what the premise states. the hypothesis cannot be logically inferred from the premise as it goes against the information provided.step 4: the hypothesis is not entailed by the premise because it proposes a different scenario."
3916,Workers are also represented in civil rights and retaliation claims.,The workers are fairly represented in all claims.,1,0,False,"step 1: in the premise, it is stated that workers are represented in civil rights and retaliation claims. this implies that there is some form of representation or advocacy for workers in these types of claims. however, it does not necessarily mean that the representation is fair or equal.step 2: the hypothesis suggests that workers are fairly represented in all claims. this is a stronger claim than the premise as it implies not only representation but also fairness. however, there is no contradiction between the premise and hypothesis, as fair representation is a possible outcome of representation.step 3: to determine if the hypothesis can be logically inferred from the premise, additional context or information is needed. the premise does not provide enough information to definitively conclude that workers are fairly represented in all claims. therefore, the hypothesis cannot be logically inferred from the premise based on the given information."
3917,"This school district is composed of six schools in total ; four elementary schools, one junior high school.","This school district is composed of six schools in total; four elementary schools, one junior high school, and one high school.",0,1,False,"step 1: in the premise, we have a school district with a total of six schools, with four elementary schools and one junior high school. the composition of schools in this district is known.step 2: in the hypothesis, an additional school, a high school, is introduced. the number of schools remains the same (six), and the number and types of existing schools (four elementary and one junior high) are also maintained.step 3: given the equal number of schools, the same types of schools, and the absence of any contradictory information, the hypothesis can be logically inferred from the premise. the presence of a high school does not alter the premise's original meaning, as it still describes a school district with six schools of various types.step 4: the hypothesis is an extension of the premise, as it adds more detail without changing the core information provided.therefore, based on logical reasoning, common sense, and lack of contradictory facts, the hypothesis is a logical inference from the premise."
3918,Take him away.,Leave him where he is.,0,0,True,"step 1: in the premise, 'take him away' is an instruction or command. it does not provide any explicit information about the subject or context. the hypothesis, 'leave him where he is', is also a command, but it is the opposite of the premise. step 2: logically speaking, the premise and hypothesis cannot be directly inferred from each other because they are contradictory instructions. in other words, 'take him away' and 'leave him where he is' cannot both be true at the same time. step 3: based on the logical analysis, the hypothesis is not entailed by the premise."
3919,"Being a three - stage process, attribution theory explains the causes of an event.","Being a three-stage process, attribution theory explains the causes of an event or behavior.",1,1,True,"step 1: in the premise, attribution theory is described as a three-stage process that explains the causes of an event. this means that attribution theory is a framework used to understand why something happened. the hypothesis repeats the same description of attribution theory being a three-stage process, but with an added 'or behavior'. 'behavior' is a synonym for 'event' in this context, thus there is no difference in meaning between the premise and hypothesis. no contradictory facts or logical principles are violated.step 2: the hypothesis can be logically inferred from the premise as the premise already implies that attribution theory can explain causes for events, and the hypothesis extends this to include 'behavior' which is equivalent to 'event'.step 3: based on the logical equivalence of 'event' and 'behavior', and the lack of contradictory facts or logical principles, the hypothesis can be inferred from the premise."
3920,Nonprofits are courting the new plutocrats in hopes of scoring philanthropic millions.,The majority of nonprofits are corrupt and do not help the public.,1,0,False,"step 1: the premise indicates that nonprofits are seeking large donations from new wealthy individuals (plutocrats). this implies a financial motivation, but it does not provide any information about the ethical or moral conduct of these nonprofits. step 2: the hypothesis alleges that the majority of nonprofits are corrupt and do not help the public. this is a strong contradiction to the premise, which suggests that nonprofits are actively seeking to provide assistance in a philanthropic capacity. step 3: the hypothesis cannot be logically inferred from the premise as it contradicts the information provided. the premise does not provide evidence or implications that the majority of nonprofits are corrupt."
3921,A short walk west from the Cityel leads to Mosque of Ibn Tulun founded in 876 as the religious center of a great military compound established by Ibn Tulun who was appointed governor of Egypt in 868.,The first appointed governor of Egypt was in the year 1912.,0,0,True,"step 1: in the premise, we have several key pieces of information. the first is that a short walk west from cityel leads to the mosque of ibn tulun. the second is that ibn tulun was appointed governor of egypt in 868 and founded the religious center there in 876. step 2: the hypothesis, however, states that the first appointed governor of egypt was in the year 1912. this contradicts the information in the premise as ibn tulun was the first governor mentioned, and he was appointed in 868, far earlier than 1912. step 3: based on the contradictory information, the hypothesis cannot be logically inferred from the premise. in fact, the hypothesis contradicts the premise."
3922,"He said, ""And worlds like ours?""  ",Is our world going to disappear too?,1,0,False,"step 1: in the premise, the speaker asks about 'worlds like ours.' this implies the existence of other potential worlds, but it does not provide any information about their fate or the fate of our world. step 2: the hypothesis asks about the future of our world, specifically whether it is going to disappear. this is not logically related to the premise as the premise does not provide any information about the fate of our world. step 3: based on the given information, the hypothesis cannot be logically inferred from the premise."
3923,"A man wearing black pants, a black shirt, and an orange hat is using a nail gun to attach tar paper to a roof.",The man is using his nail gun to attach paper tar to his roof.,1,1,True,"step 1: in the premise, we have specific details about what the man is wearing (black pants, black shirt) and what he is doing (using a nail gun to attach tar paper to a roof). tar paper is a common roofing material. no contradictory information is provided in the premise.step 2: the hypothesis 'the man is using his nail gun to attach paper tar to his roof' is equivalent to the premise. both sentences describe the same action of the man using a nail gun to attach tar paper to a roof.step 3: based on the logical equivalence and the lack of contradictory information, the hypothesis is entailed by the premise."
3924,"The award was announced at a news conference on Aug. 30 at the University of Texas School of Law, which is participating in the project.",The award was announced in private.,0,0,True,"step 1: in the premise, it is stated that the award was announced at a news conference. this indicates a public event where the announcement would be made to a large audience. step 2: the hypothesis suggests the opposite, that the award was announced in private. a private announcement would not involve a news conference or a public audience. the premise and hypothesis are contradictory. step 3: based on the information provided, the hypothesis 'the award was announced in private' is not logically inferable from the premise 'the award was announced at a news conference on aug. 30 at the university of texas school of law, which is participating in the project'."
3925,"The band continues to write, record and play live, releasing new albums in 2014 and 2016.","The band reformed in 2005 and continues to write, record and play live, releasing new albums in 2014 and 2016.",1,0,False,"step 1: the premise states that the band writes, records, and plays live, releasing new albums in 2014 and 2016. this implies that the band is still active and creating new music. no specific information is given about any disbanding or reforming of the band. step 2: the hypothesis proposes that the band reformed in 2005 and has remained active since then, releasing new albums in 2014 and 2016. the hypothesis does not contradict the premise as it also implies that the band is active and creating new music. step 3: the hypothesis does not logically follow from the premise as there is no mention of a reform in the premise. however, the lack of contradiction between the two statements also means that the hypothesis does not directly contradict the premise. thus, the hypothesis is not entailed by the premise, but it is not a contradiction either.therefore, the label should be 0 for no entailment."
3926,5 percent of GDP compared to today's 3.5 percent.,The public is pleased to see that the percent of GDP is falling.,1,0,False,"step 1. in the premise, we have information about the current percentage of gdp being 3.5 percent, and a comparison to a past percentage of 5 percent. this information does not provide any details about public sentiment or reactions. step 2. the hypothesis makes a claim about public pleasure based on the given gdp information, but there is no logical connection or justification for this inference in the premise. step 3. public sentiment or pleasure cannot be reasonably inferred from the provided gdp information. the hypothesis is not entailed by the premise."
3927,The Standard Predictor SP raw scores translate into a percentile of risk for abuse and violence for either an adult.,The Standard Predictor (SP) raw scores translate into a percentile of risk for abuse and violence for either an adolescent or an adult.,1,1,True,"step 1: in the premise, it is stated that the standard predictor (sp) raw scores are used to determine a percentile of risk for abuse and violence for an 'adult'. the term 'adult' is not explicitly defined, but it is generally understood to refer to individuals who are of legal age and not children. however, the premise does not restrict the application of the sp to adults only, and there is no factual information provided that would suggest otherwise. step 2: the hypothesis states that the sp raw scores are used to determine a percentile of risk for abuse and violence for 'either an adolescent or an adult'. this hypothesis is logically equivalent to the premise, as it does not introduce any new information or contradict the premise. the only difference is that the hypothesis explicitly mentions 'adolescent' in addition to 'adult'. step 3: based on logical equivalence and the absence of contradictory information, the hypothesis can be inferred from the premise."
3928,"It seemed to her, as she did so, that the tension of Mrs. Vandemeyer's attitude relaxed.","As she did so, it appeared the tension of Mrs. Vandemeyer's attitude became worse to the point her guest excused herself and left the room. ",0,0,True,"step 1. in the premise, 'it seemed to her' indicates a subjective perspective. the sentence 'that the tension of mrs. vandemeyer's attitude relaxed' describes an observation or perception. however, it does not provide any factual information about the actual state of mrs. vandemeyer's tension or the actions leading to this observation. the hypothesis suggests an opposite situation.step 2. the hypothesis contradicts the premise. based on the information provided, it is not logically possible to infer that 'as she did so, it appeared the tension of mrs. vandemeyer's attitude became worse' from 'it seemed to her, as she did so, that the tension of mrs. vandemeyer's attitude relaxed'. the premise and hypothesis describe mutually exclusive situations.step 3. based on the logical analysis, the hypothesis cannot be inferred from the premise."
3929,'It was ripped off a network news broadcast three minutes ago.',This is the most current information that we have.,1,1,True,"step 1: the premise indicates that the information was recently taken from a network news broadcast. this means that the information is current. step 2: the hypothesis states that 'this is the most current information that we have'. given that the premise establishes the current nature of the information, the hypothesis follows logically from the premise as it merely restates the current status of the information. step 3: based on the logical connection between the premise and hypothesis, which follows from the definition of 'most current information', the hypothesis is entailed by the premise."
3930,yeah real thick yeah,It is real thick on accident. ,1,0,False,"step 1: the premise 'yeah real thick' is a colloquial statement that could be interpreted as an affirmation or agreement, possibly describing something as being thick or substantial. the hypothesis 'it is real thick on accident' suggests that something is unintentionally thick. step 2: based on the context and the possible meanings of 'yeah real thick', it's not possible to logically infer the hypothesis from the premise. the premise lacks the specific information to support the hypothesis. step 3: the hypothesis is not entailed by the premise as there is no logical connection or implication between the two statements."
3931,2 million to a New York woman who was mistakenly kidnapped and transported to Alabama by bounty hunters.,A NY woman was inappropriately taken to Alabama by bounty hunters who had gotten her name wrong.,1,1,True,"step 1: in the premise, a new york woman was mistakenly kidnapped and taken to alabama. the key information here is that the woman was kidnapped, she is from new york, and she was taken to alabama. this scenario is factually consistent and there are no logical contradictions. common sense would suggest that such a mistake is possible in the context of bounty hunting, where there can be misunderstandings or errors in identifying the correct person. step 2: the hypothesis closely aligns with the premise, as it also mentions a new york woman being taken to alabama by bounty hunters, but with the added detail that they had gotten her name wrong. this detail is a reasonable extension of the information provided in the premise, as mistakes in identity can and do occur in real life. step 3: based on the logical reasoning, common sense understanding, and factual consistency, the hypothesis is a logical entailment of the premise."
3932,"Therefore, prompt access to all records and other information associated with these activities is needed for the effective and efficient performance of GAO's work.",The GAO does not need any access at all.,0,0,True,"step 1: in the premise, it is stated that gao needs prompt access to records and other information associated with certain activities for effective and efficient performance of its work. this implies that gao relies on this information to carry out its duties and functions. step 2: the hypothesis states that gao does not need any access at all. this directly contradicts the premise as it asserts the opposite condition. therefore, the hypothesis cannot be logically inferred from the premise. step 3: based on the logical reasoning and the contradiction between the premise and hypothesis, the hypothesis is not entailed by the premise."
3933,Two girls riding an amusement park ride.,The two girls are at the amusement park.,1,1,True,"step 1: in the premise, 'two girls riding an amusement park ride' establishes that there are two girls engaging in an activity at an amusement park. an amusement park is a location known for having various rides and attractions for entertainment. step 2: the hypothesis 'the two girls are at the amusement park' directly states that the girls are present at the amusement park. since the premise already implies that the girls are at the amusement park while they are riding a ride, the hypothesis is a logical consequence of the premise. step 3: given the logical connection between the premise and hypothesis, and the lack of contradictory information, the hypothesis is entailed by the premise."
3934,Discos pulsate to both Latin and Euro-American rhythms.,Latin and Euro-American rhythms are not present in discos.,0,0,True,"step 1: in the premise, 'discos pulsate to both latin and euro-american rhythms' indicates that discos incorporate elements of both latin and euro-american rhythms. this implies the presence of these rhythms in discos. step 2: the hypothesis states 'latin and euro-american rhythms are not present in discos'. this directly contradicts the premise as it asserts the absence of the rhythms that the premise states are present. step 3: based on the logical contradiction between the premise and hypothesis, the hypothesis is not entailed by the premise."
3935,"The castle itself comprises an early 17th-century tower house, restored with Irish oak from the park which is held together without a single nail.","The Irish oak from the park does not need to be held together with nails, it has natural adhesive abilities.",1,1,True,"step 1: in the premise, it is mentioned that the irish oak from the park is used to restore the castle and it is held together without a single nail. this suggests that the oak has some inherent property that allows it to be held together without the need for nails. step 2: the hypothesis asserts that the irish oak has natural adhesive abilities. this is a reasonable inference from the information in the premise, as the premise states that the oak is held together without nails and implies that it has some property that allows it to bond effectively. step 3: based on the logical connection between the premise and hypothesis, and the common-sense understanding that materials with natural adhesive properties do not require nails to be held together, the hypothesis can be logically inferred from the premise."
3936,Our Today's Papers column will be posted Friday (but not Thanksgiving Day).,"As Thanksgiving Day is a holiday for everyone, the column will simply be posted twice in the following week.",1,0,False,"step 1. in the premise, it is stated that the 'our today's papers' column will be posted on fridays, except for thanksgiving day. step 2. the hypothesis suggests that the column will be posted twice in the following week due to thanksgiving day being a holiday. while it is common for some media outlets to publish extra content during holidays, the premise does not mention any such arrangement. step 3. based on the given information and lacking any logical connection or common-sense reasoning to support the hypothesis, it cannot be inferred that the hypothesis is entailed by the premise.step 4. it's important to consider that holidays, such as thanksgiving day, often result in schedule changes for various reasons. however, the premise only specifies that the column will not be posted on thanksgiving day itself. the hypothesis, on the other hand, proposes an additional action (posting twice) without explicit justification or information to that effect in the given context. step 5. in conclusion, there is no entailment between the premise and the hypothesis."
3937,"The mottos engraved around the windows proclaim the self-made A vaillans (c?“urs) riens impossible ( To valiant hearts, nothing is impossible ) and Dire, faire, taire ( Say, do, and be silent ).",The mottos were engraved by the villains.,1,0,False,"step 1: in the premise, the mottos are described as being engraved around the windows of a place. the mottos themselves convey messages of valiance, determination, and silence. there is no contradictory information in the premise that would suggest the mottos were not engraved by the 'villains'. step 2: the hypothesis 'the mottos were engraved by the villains' is not logically inferred from the premise. while the premise does not contradict the hypothesis, it does not provide sufficient evidence to establish the hypothesis as a logical consequence of the premise. step 3: based on the given information, the hypothesis cannot be definitively determined to be entailed by the premise."
3938,"Willey, allegedly propositioned in the White House, was dressed professionally (at least till Clinton untucked her blouse).",Willey was dressed in a t-shirt and jeans when she was propositioned in the White House.,0,0,True,"step 1: in the premise, it is stated that willey was dressed professionally up until clinton 'untucked her blouse'. this implies that before the untucking incident, willey was dressed in a more formal attire. the premise does not provide any information about what willey was wearing at the time of the proposition.step 2: the hypothesis suggests that willey was dressed in a t-shirt and jeans when she was propositioned. this information is not logically derived from the premise as there is no mention of willey's attire at the time of the proposition in the premise.step 3: based on the given information, there is no logical entailment from the premise to the hypothesis. the hypothesis contradicts the premise as it asserts that willey was not dressed professionally at the time of the proposition."
3939,so whatever happens to it you're stuck with it,"No matter what happens to it, you cannot return it.",1,1,True,"step 1: in the premise, 'it' refers to an object that the speaker is responsible for. the sentence suggests that the speaker is unable to get rid of this object, regardless of what happens to it. this implies a strong sense of commitment or obligation.step 2: the hypothesis is consistent with the information in the premise. if an object cannot be returned, then the speaker is indeed stuck with it, as stated in the premise.step 3: based on the logical connection between the two statements and the common sense understanding of the situation, the hypothesis can be inferred from the premise."
3940,"It is a language isolate, independent of the other sign languages of Thailand such as the national Thai Sign Language.","It is a language isolate, independent of the other sign languages of Thailand such as Old Bangkok Sign Language and the national Thai Sign Language.",1,1,True,"step 1. in the premise, it is stated that the given sign language is a language isolate, independent of other sign languages of thailand. this means that it is not related to any other known sign languages in thailand. no specific sign language is mentioned besides the national thai sign language.step 2. in the hypothesis, it is reiterated that the given sign language is a language isolate, independent of other sign languages of thailand. the hypothesis mentions specifically 'old bangkok sign language' in addition to the national thai sign language.step 3. the hypothesis is entailed by the premise because the hypothesis only adds specificity to the sign languages mentioned in the premise. the hypothesis does not contradict the premise in any way, but rather clarifies it. therefore, the hypothesis is logically inferred from the premise.step 4. the final conclusion is that the hypothesis is entailed by the premise as the hypothesis provides a clearer and more detailed definition of the given information in the premise."
3941,"A member of the only student-run chapter of the American Civil Liberties Union in New York state, Zelon worked to resolve disputes between students and police officers to help protect the public's right to peaceful protest.",Zelon is not run by students in New york state.,0,0,True,"step 1: in the premise, it is stated that zelon is the only student-run chapter of the american civil liberties union in new york state. this implies that students have a significant role in the management and operation of zelon. step 2: the hypothesis states that zelon is not run by students in new york state, which directly contradicts the information provided in the premise. step 3: based on the logical analysis, the hypothesis cannot be inferred from the premise as it contradicts the stated facts."

3943,They don't have the time.,They've got the time.,0,0,True,"step 1: in the premise, 'they' are stated to not have the time. this indicates a current lack of availability or a busy schedule. step 2: in contrast, the hypothesis states 'they've got the time', suggesting an availability or lack of schedule conflicts. these two statements are logically contradictory, as one cannot simultaneously be true and false. step 3: based on the contradictory nature of the premise and hypothesis, there is no way the hypothesis can be inferred from the premise.step 4: it's important to note that the lack of entailment in this case does not imply an error or inconsistency, as the premise and hypothesis describe different states of affairs."
3944,(3) demonstrates the findings and recommendations do not warrant management action.,(3) some findings and recommendations do not need management action,1,1,True,"step 1: the premise states that the findings and recommendations do not warrant management action. this implies that the identified issues do not pose a significant risk or concern that would require intervention. step 2: the hypothesis suggests that some, but not all, of the findings and recommendations do not need management action. this interpretation is consistent with the information given in the premise, as it does not exclude the possibility that some aspects of the findings and recommendations may not require action. step 3: given the similarity in meaning between the premise and hypothesis, and the lack of contradictory information, the hypothesis can be inferred from the premise.step 4: it is important to note that while the hypothesis can be logically inferred from the premise, it does not provide any additional information. in other words, the premise already implies the hypothesis, but the hypothesis does not add anything new."
3945,"The grapes that qualify as Chianti Classico, distinguished by a coveted black rooster label, grow in the region between Florence and Siena, most of them along the ancient Via Chiantigiana, which is route S222.","In addition to grapes that qualify as Chianti Classico, there are other varieties grown in the region.",1,0,False,"step 1: the premise describes the specific type of grapes, chianti classico, which are distinguished by a label and grow in a particular region along a specific route. it does not, however, make a claim about being the only type of grapes grown in that region. common sense suggests that other types of grapes might be grown in the same region, as wine production often involves growing various grape varieties in a single area. step 2: the hypothesis introduces 'other varieties' which are not mentioned in the premise. however, the absence of a claim about exclusive grape varieties in the premise does not negate the possibility of other grape varieties being grown. step 3: based on the logical reasoning and common sense, the hypothesis is not logically entailed by the premise. the premise does not rule out the presence of other grape varieties in the region."
3946,Tudor Upheaval and the Statesmen,The non-government official and the tranquility of the tudors.,0,0,True,"step 1. the premise 'tudor upheaval' refers to a period of instability and turmoil during the reign of the tudor monarchs in england. this is a historical fact. step 2. the hypothesis 'the non-government official and the tranquility of the tudors' implies that there was an individual outside of the government who contributed to the peace or stability during the tudor period. this is not directly inferred or contradicted by the premise. however, it is a common historical perspective that some individuals, such as advisors or courtiers, played a significant role in maintaining peace and order during times of political instability. step 3. while the hypothesis cannot be logically inferred from the premise, as it introduces a new entity and a positive attribute not mentioned in the premise, it is not contradictory and is a plausible historical assumption. step 4. the hypothesis, therefore, can be seen as an extension or elaboration on the premise, rather than a logical inference.step 5. it is important to note that the absence of contradiction between the premise and hypothesis does not automatically make the hypothesis true. further historical research and evidence would be needed to support the hypothesis.step 6. based on the available information, the hypothesis is not logically entailed by the premise, but it is a reasonable assumption that can be explored further."
3947,oh oh it definitely is and i tell you what if you work hard enough it'll happen because  because i can we can see it you know i think it's going to be a couple of years before i can do that,There is no point in working hard as it'll never happen.,0,0,True,"step 1: in the premise, the speaker expresses their belief that they will be able to do something (implied to be significant or difficult) in a couple of years if they work hard enough. step 2: the hypothesis contradicts the premise by stating that it's not worth working hard as nothing will ever happen. while the speaker in the premise is expressing optimism, the hypothesis implies pessimism. step 3: based on the contradiction, the hypothesis cannot be logically inferred from the premise.step 4: it is essential to consider the context and tone to understand the speaker's intentions in the premise. the use of 'oh oh it definitely is' and 'i tell you what' indicates a strong conviction or determination, which is not consistent with the pessimistic outlook of the hypothesis.step 5: the hypothesis seems to make a general statement about the futility of working hard, regardless of the specific circumstances mentioned in the premise. this lack of specificity weakens the connection between the hypothesis and the premise.therefore, the hypothesis is not entailed by the premise."
3948,Again the colour deserted the other's face.,The other's face turned a deep red. ,0,1,False,"step 1: the premise describes the colour leaving the other's face, which could mean that the colour was previously present but is now absent. this could be interpreted as the other person losing colour, appearing pale or white. however, the absence of colour can also be indicative of strong emotions, particularly anger, which can result in a person's face turning red. step 2: the hypothesis suggests that the other person's face turned a deep red. this is a form of losing colour, albeit a specific one, and it is a common response to strong emotions such as anger. the hypothesis is consistent with the premise and can be logically inferred as a possible outcome based on the information provided. step 3: based on the logical reasoning and common sense understanding of human emotions and facial expressions, the hypothesis can be inferred from the premise."
3949,After three years he moved to St. Louis and joined the staff of the St. Louis Post-Dispatch as reporter and assistant editor.,After three years he moved to St. Louis and joined the staff of the Planet Earth Post - Dispatch as reporter and assistant editor.,0,0,True,"step 1: the premise states that after three years, a person moved to st. louis and joined the staff of the st. louis post-dispatch as a reporter and assistant editor. this implies that the person had a career change and relocated to st. louis. step 2: the hypothesis proposes that the same person moved to st. louis and joined the staff of the planet earth post-dispatch instead. while the hypothesis maintains that the person moved to st. louis and joined a staff as a reporter and assistant editor, it introduces a new detail about the specific newspaper. step 3: however, without additional context or information, it is impossible to logically infer that the planet earth post-dispatch is the same newspaper as the st. louis post-dispatch. in the absence of such information, the hypothesis cannot be entailed by the premise.step 4: it's important to note that even if the planet earth post-dispatch was a well-known publication or had a significant presence in st. louis, it would still not be a logical inference from the premise. the hypothesis requires an additional piece of information that is not provided in the premise.thus, the hypothesis is not entailed by the premise."
3950,"The second was in the combination of case study methods with other methods, particularly surveys, in order to achieve the generalizability that evaluators called external validity.",The case study methods were not combined with other methods.,0,0,True,"step 1: the premise describes a research methodology where case study methods are used in combination with other methods, such as surveys, to enhance the generalizability of the research findings. this is a common practice in research to improve the external validity of the study. step 2: the hypothesis states that the case study methods were not combined with other methods. this directly contradicts the information provided in the premise. therefore, the hypothesis cannot be logically inferred from the premise. step 3: based on the logical reasoning, the hypothesis is not entailed by the premise."
3951,"As Ben Yagoda writes in the New York Times Book Review , somewhere along the way, Kidder must have decided not to write a book about Tommy O'Connor.",A book was written about Tommy O'Connor. ,0,0,True,"step 1: in the premise, ben yagoda writes that kidder decided not to write a book about tommy o'connor. this indicates that there was initially a plan to write a book about him, but for some reason, kidder changed his mind. step 2: the hypothesis, 'a book was written about tommy o'connor', contradicts the premise. if a book was indeed written, it would not be accurate to say that kidder decided not to write one. step 3: based on the logical inconsistency between the premise and hypothesis, the hypothesis cannot be inferred from the premise."
3952,Our advertising does not--and never has--treated all drugs equally.,We spend millions of dollars in drug advertisements alone.,1,0,False,"step 1: the premise states that our advertising does not treat all drugs equally. this suggests that different drugs receive varying degrees of attention or emphasis in the advertising. it does not provide any specific information about the total amount spent on drug advertisements or how that spending is distributed among different drugs. step 2: the hypothesis states that a large amount (millions of dollars) is spent on drug advertisements, but it does not indicate that this spending is unequal among different drugs. there's no logical connection between the premise and hypothesis based on the given information. step 3: based on the information provided, the hypothesis cannot be logically inferred from the premise."
3953,2. Receiving Water Samples,The water samples are received by the lab.,1,1,True,"step 1: the premise 'receiving water samples' is a passive statement that implies the existence of an agent involved in the process of receiving water samples. however, the premise does not explicitly state who is performing this action. step 2: the hypothesis 'the water samples are received by the lab' is a statement that clearly identifies the lab as the agent performing the action of receiving the water samples. step 3: given that the hypothesis is a logical and sensible implication of the premise, as it specifies the agent involved in the receiving process, it can be inferred from the premise. therefore, the hypothesis is entailed by the premise.step 4: it is also important to note that there is no contradictory information in the given context that would prevent the inference from being made."
3954,"But even if someone in the military did give an order to protect Gore, this should hardly count as a mark against him.","If someone in the military ordered protection for Gore, that person should be court-marshaled.",0,0,True,"step 1: in the premise, the speaker argues that if someone in the military did give an order to protect gore, it should not be considered a negative mark against him. this implies that there is no inherent wrongdoing in giving such an order. step 2: in contrast, the hypothesis suggests that if someone in the military did order protection for gore, that person should be court-marshaled. this is a clear contradiction to the premise. there is no logical or factual connection between the premise and hypothesis that would allow the hypothesis to be inferred. step 3: based on the given information, the hypothesis cannot be inferred from the premise."
3955,"Our 1996/97 survey found that about 60 percent or more of the supervisors and managers reported that their agencies had not provided them with the training necessary to accomplish critical, results-oriented management tasks.",Our 1996/97 survey found that about less than 60 percent of the supervisors and managers reported that their agencies failed to provide the necessary training.,0,0,True,"step 1: the premise states that a survey conducted in 1996/97 found that more than 60 percent of supervisors and managers reported their agencies did not provide them with necessary training. step 2: the hypothesis suggests that less than 60 percent of supervisors and managers reported their agencies failed to provide necessary training. the hypothesis contradicts the premise as the percentage reported is different. step 3: based on the given information, the hypothesis is not logically entailed by the premise."
3956,Parks and  there are nature trails in Phoenix Park and the Dublin Zoo has a pet corner and zoo train especially designed for younger children (see page 79).,Phoenix Park can only be driven through.,0,0,True,"step 1: in the premise, phoenix park is described as having nature trails. this means that there are pathways or routes for walking or hiking within the park. there is no mention of the park being only drivable. the dublin zoo's pet corner and zoo train are separate entities mentioned as being designed for younger children and do not affect the accessibility of phoenix park.step 2: the hypothesis 'phoenix park can only be driven through' contradicts the information provided in the premise. there is no logical or factual basis for this hypothesis based on the given premise.step 3: based on the information from the premise and the logical principle that a contradiction cannot be logically inferred from a statement, the hypothesis 'phoenix park can only be driven through' cannot be logically inferred from the premise."
3957,How did the soldier know a barbarian could fight?,The soldier didn't know anything about the barbarian.,0,0,True,"step 1: in the premise, there's no information given about how the soldier 'knew' a barbarian could fight. it only states that the soldier had this knowledge. step 2: the hypothesis, 'the soldier didn't know anything about the barbarian', contradicts the given premise since it suggests that the soldier didn't have the knowledge mentioned. step 3: based on the logical relationship between the premise and hypothesis, the hypothesis does not follow logically from the premise."

3964,Performance measures are key to monitoring progress in addressing improper payments.,Performance measures are occasionally used to monitor progress.,1,1,True,"step 1: in the premise, it is stated that performance measures are key to monitoring progress in addressing improper payments. this implies that performance measures play a significant role in the monitoring process. step 2: the hypothesis suggests that performance measures are occasionally used to monitor progress. this is a less frequent occurrence than the 'key' role suggested in the premise, but it does not contradict it. in fact, occasional use of performance measures can still contribute to the overall monitoring and improvement process. step 3: based on the logical relationship between the premise and hypothesis, and the lack of contradictory information, the hypothesis can be inferred from the premise, as the hypothesis implies a lesser but still existing role for performance measures in monitoring progress."
3965,"Sue me, Royko wrote.",Royko was over their crap. ,1,0,False,"step 1: in the premise, sue writes the phrase 'sue me, royko'. this is an idiomatic expression, often used to indicate a challenge or invitation to bring a lawsuit against the speaker. it does not provide any direct information about royko's feelings or actions.step 2: the hypothesis 'royko was over their crap' is not logically entailed by the premise. 'being over something' typically implies that a person no longer cares or is no longer affected by a situation. the premise only indicates that royko has invited or challenged someone to sue him, but it does not provide any information about his emotional state or his desire to continue engaging in a situation.step 3: based on the given information, there is no logical entailment from the premise to the hypothesis."
3966,"After weighing the options, we arranged for a donation from Lexis of their HotDocs document assembly software for each state, which will greatly enhance the availability of legal forms that lay people can easily fill out online.",We got a software donation from Lexis for the law school.,1,1,True,"step 1: in the premise, it is stated that 'we arranged for a donation from lexis of their hotdocs document assembly software for each state'. this indicates that the donation was made by lexis to the organization or entity referred to as 'we'. the recipient of the donation is identified as 'each state'. it is also mentioned that the donation will greatly enhance the availability of legal forms for lay people. step 2: the hypothesis 'we got a software donation from lexis for the law school' is consistent with the premise. both statements describe a donation from lexis to the 'we' entity. however, the hypothesis is less specific about the recipients of the donation, only mentioning 'the law school' instead of 'each state'. step 3: the hypothesis can be inferred from the premise, as the premise implies that the donation was made to a law-related organization or entity (since legal forms are being referred to). the hypothesis, stating that the law school received the donation, is a specific case of this more general implication."
3967,The others depended on it.,It would not let those who depended on it down. ,1,1,True,"step 1: the premise suggests a situation where 'it' is something that others rely on. the meaning of 'depended' implies a trust or reliance on 'it' for support or success. step 2: the hypothesis states that 'it' would not let down those who depended on it, which means it would fulfill or meet their expectations. this is a reasonable assumption based on common sense and human behavior - people generally strive to meet the needs or expectations of those who depend on them. step 3: the hypothesis can be inferred from the premise because it is a logical consequence of the premise. the premise sets up a scenario where others have a significant investment in 'it', and the hypothesis describes 'it' as a reliable entity that would not disappoint those who depend on it."
3968,"A Show About  Inside Washington ians spend the final minutes of the discussion on the moral character of Seinfeld . Occasional poor taste is partly redeemed by great wit, says Evan Thomas.",Seinfeld has poor taste.,1,1,True,"step 1: in the premise, evan thomas is expressing his opinion that seinfeld's occasional poor taste is partly redeemed by great wit. this implies that seinfeld indeed has poor taste according to the premise. step 2: the hypothesis, 'seinfeld has poor taste', is not only consistent with the premise but is also explicitly stated in the premise. therefore, the hypothesis is a logical entailment of the premise. step 3: based on the logical relationship between the premise and hypothesis, the hypothesis is a logical entailment of the premise."
3969,"You leave it to me, miss, and I'll fix the whole thing up in two ticks. 67 ""Some lad!"" commented Tuppence, with a nod of approval.",I neglected to offer to help fix the thing for the miss.,0,0,True,"step 1: the premise describes a situation where a person (you) assures another person (miss) that you will take care of fixing a problem. the speaker's confidence and the approving comment from tuppence suggest that the problem is significant and that the speaker is capable of resolving it. however, the premise does not provide any information about an offer or refusal to help from the speaker prior to this.step 2: the hypothesis suggests a counterfactual scenario where the speaker did not offer to help in the first place. this is not directly contradictory to the premise, as the premise does not explicitly state that an offer was made. however, the premise's description of the speaker's confidence and tuppence's approving comment suggest that an offer was indeed made.step 3: based on the available information, the hypothesis cannot be logically inferred from the premise. while the premise does not explicitly state that an offer was made, the present tense and confident language used in the premise imply that an offer was indeed made at some point. thus, the hypothesis contradicts the most likely interpretation of the premise, and it is not a logical consequence of the information provided."
3970,Saint-Germain-des-Pr??s,nan,1,0,False,"step 1. in the given context, the premise 'saint-germain-des-prés' is a name of a place, specifically a district in paris, france. it does not provide any explicit information about events or actions. the hypothesis 'nan' is an acronym that does not convey any meaningful information or relationship with the premise. step 2. the hypothesis 'nan' cannot be logically inferred from the premise 'saint-germain-des-prés' as there is no connection between the two. the hypothesis lacks any context or meaning that could be derived from the premise. step 3. based on the absence of logical or factual connections between the premise and hypothesis, the hypothesis 'nan' is not entailed by the premise 'saint-germain-des-prés'."
3971,"Two black little boys hanging over an upside down bicycle, one examining the pedal.",Children were looking at a bike.,1,1,True,"step 1: in the premise, we have two black little boys engaging in an activity with an upside down bicycle. the boys are examining the bicycle, with one focusing on the pedal. this scene can be interpreted as an investigation or exploration of the bicycle. step 2: the hypothesis 'children were looking at a bike' can be logically inferred from the premise as it describes the exact same situation with the same actors and the same object. looking at a bike is a subcategory of examining a bike, and the boys' actions in the premise can be reasonably understood as looking at the bike. step 3: based on the logical connection between the premise and hypothesis, and the lack of contradictory information, the hypothesis can be inferred from the premise."
3972,"Shamefully, over the last decade, the average revenue of the country's most successful law firms has increased by more than 50 percent while pro- bono hours have dropped by one-third.","The average revenue of law firms have increased, but that is not the reason the pro bono hours are affected.",1,0,False,"step 1: in the premise, we have the information that the average revenue of the most successful law firms has increased by more than 50 percent over the last decade. this increase in revenue is not directly linked with a decrease in pro bono hours in the premise. however, it is common sense to assume that a law firm with higher revenue might have more resources to allocate towards various activities, including pro bono work. however, the premise does not necessarily imply a cause-and-effect relationship between the revenue increase and the decrease in pro bono hours. step 2: the hypothesis suggests a different reason for the decrease in pro bono hours, but it does not contradict the premise. it is possible for other factors to contribute to the decrease in pro bono hours, such as changes in law firm priorities or external factors. step 3: based on the given information, the hypothesis cannot be logically inferred from the premise as there is no definitive proof provided in the premise that the increase in average revenue directly leads to a decrease in pro bono hours."
3973,The side of a building next to a church is painted with a brightly colored Coca-Cola sign.,There is a Coca-Cola sign on a building.,1,1,True,"step 1: in the premise, it is stated that there is a brightly colored coca-cola sign on the side of a building next to a church. this sign is an instance of a coca-cola sign being present on a building. step 2: the hypothesis 'there is a coca-cola sign on a building' is a more general statement that can include the specific example given in the premise. since the hypothesis is a more general instance of the premise, it can be logically inferred from it. step 3: based on the logical relationship between the premise and hypothesis, and the lack of contradictory information, the hypothesis can be inferred from the premise."
3974,well i sort that sort of goes to my pet peeve about the education system in this country too,I think our educations system is as good as they get.,0,0,True,"step 1: in the premise, the speaker expresses a concern or issue about the education system in their country. this is an opinion or belief. in the hypothesis, the speaker also expresses a belief about the education system, but this time stating that it is 'as good as they get'.  step 2: to determine if the hypothesis can be logically inferred from the premise, we need to consider the logical relationship between the two statements. the hypothesis does not contradict the premise, but it is not a direct logical consequence of it either. the premise only mentions a problem with the education system, while the hypothesis states that it is the best available option. while the two statements share the topic of the education system, they do not logically entail each other. step 3: based on the given information, the hypothesis cannot be logically inferred from the premise."
3975,"The girls who wish to wear the scarf in Turkey say it represents Muslim female empowerment, and they consider themselves oppressed if it's forbidden.",No women in Turkey ever wear a scarf.,0,0,True,"step 1: in the premise, it is stated that some girls in turkey believe that wearing a scarf represents muslim female empowerment and consider themselves oppressed if it's forbidden. this indicates that there are girls in turkey who wear scarves and hold this belief. step 2: the hypothesis states 'no women in turkey ever wear a scarf.' this directly contradicts the information provided in the premise. a lack of women wearing scarves in turkey is not a logical outcome or implication from the premise. step 3: based on the logical reasoning and the contradiction with the premise, the hypothesis cannot be inferred from the premise."
3976,Remember as you watch these skillful operators that they cheerfully perform the same tasks in snowdrifts and the thickest fog and cloud in the depths of winter.,The operators only work when it's sunny and above 80 degrees.,0,0,True,"step 1. in the premise, it is stated that the operators perform their tasks in various weather conditions including snowdrifts, thick fog, and cloud in the depths of winter. this implies that they are capable of working in less than ideal weather conditions. step 2. the hypothesis, however, suggests that the operators only work when it's sunny and above 80 degrees. this directly contradicts the information provided in the premise. step 3. based on the given information, the hypothesis cannot be logically inferred from the premise as it contradicts the facts stated."
3978,"With its cobblestone courtyard, it looks like a picturesque country pub, and seems to be a must for every visitor.",It has dirt yards and looks like a typical city pub.,0,0,True,"step 1: in the premise, the pub is described as having a picturesque country setting with a cobblestone courtyard. this implies a rural or suburban environment, and the phrase 'must for every visitor' suggests popularity and appeal. step 2: the hypothesis describes the pub as having dirt yards and looking like a typical city pub. this contradicts the premise's description of a cobblestone courtyard, which is a clear indication of a country or urban area that is different from a typical city. step 3: based on the given information, the hypothesis cannot be logically inferred from the premise as it contradicts the key information provided."
3979,Pick up a map from the tourist office here and ask about walking tours.,"No one is usually at the tourist office, so you'll have to go somewhere else to find out about walking tours.",0,0,True,"step 1: in the premise, the speaker is instructed to pick up a map and ask about walking tours at the tourist office. this implies that the tourist office is a common place to find information about walking tours. step 2: the hypothesis states that no one is usually at the tourist office, suggesting an absence of personnel. however, the premise does not provide any information about the presence or absence of people at the tourist office. the hypothesis contradicts the common sense understanding of a tourist office being a place where one can find information and assistance. step 3: based on the lack of logical connection and the contradiction to common sense understanding, the hypothesis cannot be logically inferred from the premise.step 4: it's important to note that the premise does not guarantee that the tourist office will be staffed when the speaker arrives, but it does provide information that it's a common place to find walking tour information."
3980,Two significant efforts during the 1980s and 1990s served to restore the aging tower and the light was relit as a non-navigational aid in 2000.,Two significant efforts during the 19801 and 1990s served to restore the aging tower and the light was relit as a non-navigational aid in 2000.,0,1,False,"step 1. the premise describes two significant restoration efforts that took place during the 1980s and 1990s for an aging tower, leading to the relighting of the tower's light as a non-navigational aid in the year 2000. step 2. the hypothesis repeats the information in the premise, with identical descriptions of the restoration efforts and the year of relighting. step 3. since the hypothesis accurately repeats the information in the premise, it can be logically inferred from the premise. the hypothesis is an entailment of the premise."
3981,"It was built only a dozen years after the Louis XII wing but, reflecting the contrast between the debonair Ren?­ais?­sance prince and his dour predecessor, is a world apart in elegance and panache.",Louis XII kept a simple life due to his fear of bright colors.,1,0,False,"step 1: in the premise, we have a description of a building that was constructed only a dozen years after the louis xii wing. the building is contrasted with the debonair louis xii in terms of elegance and panache. no information is provided about louis xii's personal life or his preferences regarding colors. step 2: the hypothesis, 'louis xii kept a simple life due to his fear of bright colors', is not logically entailed by the premise, as there is no mention of louis xii's fear of bright colors in the premise. step 3: based on the given information, the hypothesis cannot be inferred from the premise."
3982,"He pulled on his leather cloak, a gift from Ca'daan for the cooler climate of the town.",Ca'daan had given him a leather cloak to hide his weapons.,1,0,False,"step 1: the premise describes an action taken by the subject, who received a leather cloak from ca'daan. the cloak is mentioned as being made of leather and a gift from ca'daan. no information is provided about any hidden weapons or reasons for hiding them.step 2: the hypothesis suggests an additional reason for ca'daan giving the subject a leather cloak, specifically to hide his weapons. however, the premise does not provide evidence of this hidden reason, and it is not a logical necessity that a leather cloak given as a gift must be intended to hide weapons.step 3: based on the given information, the hypothesis is not entailed by the premise. the premise does not provide sufficient evidence to logically infer that ca'daan had given the subject a leather cloak to hide his weapons."
3983,"Calls also come from people who have been denied food stamps or have problems with their landlords, she says.",The calls are answered around the clock by undergraduate law students.,1,0,False,"step 1: in the premise, it is mentioned that calls come from people with food stamp issues or landlord problems. this implies that the call center receives calls from individuals who require assistance with their daily needs or housing. step 2: the hypothesis states that undergraduate law students answer these calls around the clock. however, the premise does not provide any information about who answers the calls. therefore, based on the given information, it is not logically possible to infer that hypothesis is entailed by the premise. step 3: the hypothesis is not entailed by the premise."
3984,"She would never forgive me if I let Alfred Inglethorp, her husband, be arrested now, when a word from me could save him!"" 72 Chapter 6 THE INQUEST In the interval before the inquest, Poirot was unfailing in his activity. ",She would understand if he got arrested.,0,0,True,"step 1: the premise suggests that the woman in question is adamantly opposed to alfred inglethorp's arrest, implying a strong emotional attachment to him. this attachment could stem from various reasons, such as love, loyalty, or fear. step 2: the hypothesis states that she would understand if he got arrested, suggesting a change in her attitude towards the arrest. this change could be due to new information, a shift in her emotions, or an external influence. the hypothesis does not contradict the premise, but it does introduce a different perspective. step 3: it is not logically possible to determine if the hypothesis is entailed by the premise based on the given information. the hypothesis introduces a new perspective that is not directly implied by the premise. it is possible that the woman's attitude towards the arrest changed, but the premise does not provide enough information to infer this definitively. thus, the hypothesis is not entailed by the premise, but it does not contradict it either."
3985,"Anse had subsided, though he was still watching the sergeant with an unrelenting gaze.",Anse was still watching the stars.,0,0,True,"step 1. the premise indicates that anse has 'subsided' but is still 'watching the sergeant', which suggests that anse may no longer be active or moving, but his attention is focused on the sergeant. the hypothesis suggests that anse could also be watching the stars. there is no contradiction between anse watching the sergeant and anse watching the stars. it is common for people or animals to watch multiple things at once, especially when their attention is not required for any active task. step 2. the hypothesis cannot be logically inferred from the premise, as the premise does not mention the stars, and the hypothesis is not a necessary consequence of the information in the premise. step 3. based on the given information, the hypothesis is not entailed by the premise."
3986,Two men walking their canoe through the woods.,a couple of men walk their canoe,1,1,True,"step 1: in the premise, 'two men walking their canoe through the woods' describes a situation where two men are carrying a canoe. the key information here is 'two men' and 'carrying a canoe'. 'carrying a canoe' implies that they are transporting it to another location. a 'couple' is a term used to refer to two people, typically a romantic or married pair. step 2: the hypothesis 'a couple of men walk their canoe' is a variant of the premise, where 'couple' is used instead of 'two men'. the hypothesis does not add any new information or contradict the premise. it can be inferred that if 'two men' are walking with a canoe, then 'a couple of men' can also be walking with a canoe. step 3: based on the logical equivalence between 'two men' and 'a couple of men', and the fact that carrying a canoe is not affected by the relationship status of the men, the hypothesis is logically entailed by the premise."
3987,The last 12 years of his life are a blank.,He recalls every moment of the last 12 years in excruciating detail,0,0,True,"step 1: in the premise, 'the last 12 years of his life are a blank' suggests that the person in question has no memory or recollection of the events that occurred during the last 12 years. this is a clear statement about the lack of memory or awareness. step 2: the hypothesis, 'he recalls every moment of the last 12 years in excruciating detail', states the opposite. it suggests that the person has vivid recollections of each moment during the last 12 years. these two statements contradict each other. step 3: based on the information provided, the hypothesis cannot be logically inferred from the premise."
3988,"But on this subject, the medical profession is asleep at the switch.",The medicinal career is progressive in multiple ways,0,0,True,"step 1: the premise expresses a criticism or concern that the medical profession is not adequately addressing or progressing in some way. it does not provide specific information about the medical career being progressive or not. step 2: the hypothesis suggests that the medical career is progressive in multiple ways. however, there is no contradiction between the premise and hypothesis, as the premise does not claim that the medical career is not progressive. step 3: the hypothesis cannot be directly logically inferred from the premise because the premise does not provide enough information to support the hypothesis. however, it is important to note that the absence of evidence does not prove the negative (that the hypothesis is not true). it is still possible that the medical profession is making progress in various ways, but the premise does not convey that information."
3990,"For example, Courmayeur, the country's most venerable ski resort, never adopted its more Italian name of Cetemaggiore.",The people who live in Courmayeur generally speak French.,1,0,False,"step 1: in the premise, it is stated that courmayeur is the most venerable ski resort in italy, but it never adopted its more italian name of cetemaggiore. this information does not provide any details about the language spoken by the people living in courmayeur. common sense tells us that the location of a ski resort does not necessarily determine the language spoken by its inhabitants. step 2: the hypothesis states that the people who live in courmayeur generally speak french. however, there is no logical connection or entailment between the premise and the hypothesis. step 3: based on the given information, the hypothesis cannot be logically inferred from the premise."
3991,have you that's true have you read The Silence of the Lambs,Have you ever read a magazine?,0,0,True,"step 1. in the premise, the speaker is asking if the interlocutor has read the book 'the silence of the lambs'. there is no information given about magazines in the premise. step 2. the hypothesis, 'have you ever read a magazine?' is not logically related to the premise. there is no information in the premise that implies the interlocutor has or has not read magazines. step 3. based on the lack of information connecting the premise and hypothesis, the hypothesis cannot be logically inferred from the premise.step 4. it is also important to note that the hypothesis appears to be an unrelated question, making it highly unlikely that it can be logically inferred from the premise."
3992,"In October 1999 they refinanced again with New Century Mortgage, another subprime lender.",They refinanced with another lender that charged them 10% interest.,1,0,False,"step 1: in the premise, it is stated that they refinanced with new century mortgage in october 1999. new century mortgage was a well-known subprime lender during that period. subprime lenders often offered less favorable terms, including higher interest rates. however, the premise does not mention the interest rate they were charged by new century mortgage. step 2: the hypothesis suggests that they refinanced with another lender, who charged them 10% interest. this is not directly stated or implied in the premise. however, it is common sense and a well-documented fact that subprime lenders, including new century mortgage, often charged higher interest rates. step 3: based on the given information and logical principles, the hypothesis is not directly entailed by the premise. however, it is a reasonable inference given the common knowledge about subprime lenders and their lending practices during that period. in common-sense reasoning, we can infer the likelihood of higher interest rates when dealing with subprime lenders. therefore, the hypothesis is plausible and may be true, but it is not logically entailed by the premise."
3993,"To-day, if you like.","Today, whether you like it or not.",0,0,True,"step 1: the premise 'to-day, if you like' implies a suggestion or an offer for an action to be taken 'to-day' only if the listener's preference is met. it does not impose any obligation or requirement. step 2: the hypothesis 'today, whether you like it or not' introduces a sense of compulsion or obligation to do something today, regardless of personal preference. step 3: the hypothesis contradicts the premise since it removes the condition of 'if you like'. therefore, the hypothesis cannot be logically inferred from the premise. step 4: the hypothesis is not entailed by the premise."
3994,"However, OMB staff provided information during and at the conclusion of the review that was incorporated where appropriate.",No further information was provided by the OMB staff.,0,0,True,"step 1: in the premise, it is stated that omb staff provided information during and at the conclusion of the review. this implies that the omb staff did share some information with the agency, but the extent and timing of this information is not explicitly stated. step 2: the hypothesis suggests that no further information was provided by the omb staff. this is a contradiction to the premise, as the premise states that information was provided, even if it was only provided at certain points in the review. step 3: based on the logical analysis, the hypothesis is not entailed by the premise as it contradicts the information provided in the premise."
3995,"We know this, because later she asked Dorcas to bring her some. ",Dorcas did not bring any.,1,0,False,"step 1: in the premise, it is stated that there is information known to us because later, dorcas was asked to bring something. the hypothesis suggests that dorcas did not bring anything at all. step 2: the premise does not provide enough information to logically infer or deduce the hypothesis, as it only states that dorcas was asked to bring something, not that she actually did or did not bring it. step 3: based on the given information, we cannot logically infer that dorcas did not bring anything, as the premise does not provide sufficient evidence to support the hypothesis."
3996,Boston Medical Center as a value-added service in the emergency department.,Boston Medical Center has a service in the ED to treat alcoholics.,1,1,True,"step 1: in the premise, 'boston medical center as a value-added service in the emergency department' suggests that boston medical center provides additional benefits or services in the emergency department beyond basic medical care. this can include various support services, specialized treatments, or enhanced patient care. step 2: the hypothesis 'boston medical center has a service in the ed to treat alcoholics' is a specific instance of a value-added service. alcohol treatment is a recognized specialized healthcare service. therefore, it is a reasonable inference that boston medical center, as a value-added service provider in the ed, may offer alcohol treatment. step 3: based on the logical reasoning and the non-contradictory nature of the premise and hypothesis, the hypothesis can be inferred from the premise."
3997,A man is holding a bus pole in front of a building.,The man is outside,1,1,True,"step 1: a man holding a bus pole in front of a building indicates that the man is likely waiting for a bus. the location, 'in front of a building', suggests a bus stop or a bus station. this scenario is consistent with common sense and factual knowledge. the hypothesis, 'the man is outside', is an inclusive statement, as it does not contradict the information provided in the premise.step 2: the hypothesis 'the man is outside' is an entailment of the premise 'a man is holding a bus pole in front of a building', as the man cannot be 'inside' while holding a bus pole outside. the premise implies an outdoor location due to the presence of a bus pole, which is a fixture typically found in outdoor bus stops or stations.step 3: based on logical reasoning, common sense, and the lack of contradictory facts, the hypothesis 'the man is outside' can be inferred from the premise 'a man is holding a bus pole in front of a building'."
3998,um wow often how often do you go out to the baseball park,How often do you get to go to the Mets ballpark?,1,1,True,"step 1: in the premise, the speaker is asking about the frequency of the person's visits to 'the baseball park.' 'baseball park' is a general term that can refer to any baseball stadium, including the mets' ballpark. no specific information is given about which team's ballpark is being discussed.step 2: the hypothesis asks about the frequency of visits to 'the mets ballpark.' since the mets are a specific baseball team that plays in a specific ballpark, this question is a special case of the more general question asked in the premise.step 3: given that the hypothesis is a more specific version of the premise, the hypothesis can be logically inferred from the premise. the premise sets up the context for discussing the frequency of visits to a baseball park, and the hypothesis asks about the same thing but for a more specific instance of that context.step 4: based on the logical relationship between the premise and hypothesis, and given that no contradictory information is provided, the hypothesis can be inferred from the premise."
3999,Now who's on top and who's underneath? she crowed.,"Get out of my bed, she cried.",0,0,True,"step 1: in the premise, the person (she) is making a statement about who is on top and who is underneath. this implies a situation where there are two people or objects in a vertical relationship. the tone of the statement suggests a playful or teasing context. the hypothesis, 'get out of my bed,' is a common phrase used to express a desire for personal space or to dismiss someone from a physical area. it does not necessarily involve a vertical relationship.step 2: the hypothesis 'get out of my bed' cannot be logically inferred from the premise 'now who's on top and who's underneath?' because the premise does not provide enough context or information to directly support the hypothesis. the hypothesis is not a necessary or logical consequence of the premise.step 3: based on the given information, the hypothesis is not entailed by the premise."
4000,"The Palais des Beaux Arts (Place de la Republique) has a large collection including works by Rubens, Van Dyck, and Goya.",There are 849 paintings on display.,1,0,False,"step 1: the premise describes the palais des beaux arts as having a large collection that includes works by rubens, van dyck, and goya. it does not provide any information about the total number of paintings on display. step 2: the hypothesis asserts that there are 849 paintings on display. however, the premise does not logically entail this number, as it does not specify the exact number of works in the collection. step 3: based on the information provided, the hypothesis cannot be logically inferred from the premise."
4001,The risk of petty crime is high and the atmosphere is a little too oppressive for most tourists to feel comfortable walking the streets alone (see page 116).,The risk of petty crime is so high that tourism is very low. ,1,1,True,"step 1: in the premise, it is stated that the risk of petty crime is high, making tourists feel uncomfortable. this implies that the crime rate is significant and could deter people from visiting the area. step 2: the hypothesis suggests that the high crime rate has led to very low tourism. this is a reasonable inference from the premise, as a high crime rate would indeed be expected to lead to reduced tourism. step 3: based on the logical reasoning that a high crime rate would deter tourists and the lack of contradictory information in the premise, the hypothesis can be inferred from the premise."
4002,"It appeared in 1886, eight years before Captain Alfred Dreyfus, an Alsatian Jew in the French Army, was arrested on what proved to be trumped-up charges of spying for the Germans.",Alfred Dreyfus was quickly acquitted of all charges.,1,0,False,"step 1: the premise provides information about the year of an event (1886) related to alfred dreyfus, an alsatian jew in the french army, and his arrest on false charges. it does not mention any information about his acquittal. step 2: the hypothesis talks about alfred dreyfus being 'quickly acquitted of all charges'. however, the premise does not contain any information that can logically lead to this conclusion as the premise only states that dreyfus was arrested on false charges and does not mention any details about his acquittal or the time frame. step 3: based on the information given in the premise and hypothesis, it cannot be logically inferred that alfred dreyfus was 'quickly acquitted of all charges'."
4003,At the end of the 19th century unemployed samurai' adventurous but still attached to the old traditions took their families to Hokkaido to carve out a new life for themselves.,Samurai were not allowed in Hokkaido until the end of the 19th century.,0,0,True,"step 1: in the premise, it is mentioned that unemployed samurai came to hokkaido at the end of the 19th century with their families to start a new life. this implies that there was a reason why they had to leave their previous places and come to hokkaido. the provided context suggests that they were not able to find employment in their old regions and chose to relocate to hokkaido. step 2: the hypothesis implies that samurai were not allowed in hokkaido before the end of the 19th century. this contradicts the premise because the premise states that unemployed samurai were present in hokkaido during that time. step 3: based on the information provided, the hypothesis is not entailed by the premise. the premise describes a factual situation, while the hypothesis introduces a restriction that is not supported by the premise."
4005,He sure can take care of a fella good.,He certainly knows how to let a fella die in his arms. ,0,0,True,"step 1. in the premise, 'he can take care of a fella good' suggests that this person is capable of providing for or protecting someone. this is a positive assessment of his abilities. in contrast, the hypothesis 'he certainly knows how to let a fella die in his arms' implies that this person can also let someone die under his care, which is a negative outcome.step 2. the hypothesis cannot be logically inferred from the premise because knowing how to care for someone does not logically imply knowing how to let them die. the two statements describe different actions.step 3. based on the logical analysis, the hypothesis is not entailed by the premise."
4006,Chinese Opera.,Historical Chinese Opera,1,1,True,"step 1. in the premise, 'chinese opera' is referred to as an art form that originated from china. it is a well-established fact that chinese opera has historical significance. step 2. the hypothesis, 'historical chinese opera,' aligns with the premise as it specifically refers to the historical aspect of chinese opera. since the hypothesis is a more specific version of the premise, it can be logically inferred from it. step 3. given the logical relationship between the premise and hypothesis, and the factual consistency of both statements, the hypothesis is entailed by the premise."
4007,"They encourage us to indulge ourselves, and they exhort us to worry about our competence at work.","If we continue to disappoint at work, we'll get fired.",1,0,False,"step 1: in the premise, 'they' are urging us to indulge ourselves and worry about our work performance. indulging ourselves could mean taking time for relaxation or self-care, while worrying about competence suggests a focus on improving skills or addressing weaknesses. neither statement directly implies the hypothesis about getting fired. however, it is common sense that poor performance at work can lead to job termination.step 2: the hypothesis is not logically entailed by the premise as stated. while it's true that focusing on competence and indulging oneself doesn't contradict the possibility of getting fired, the premise doesn't provide enough information to infer that consequence.step 3: based on the given information, the hypothesis cannot be logically inferred from the premise."
4008,yeah i usually go to Callaway's or Wolfe,I usually go to Callaway's for its price or Wolfe's because of quality,1,0,False,"step 1: the premise states that the speaker usually goes to callaway's or wolfe's. this information does not provide any specific reason for the choice between the two places. step 2: the hypothesis suggests that the speaker goes to callaway's for its price or wolfe's because of quality. these reasons could potentially explain why the speaker chooses one place over the other. step 3: based on the given information, it cannot be logically concluded which reason is the correct one for the speaker's choice. both the price and quality could be valid reasons, and the premise does not exclude the possibility that the speaker considers both factors. thus, the hypothesis is not logically entailed by the premise.step 4: however, it is important to note that the premise and hypothesis are not contradictory. the hypothesis does not negate the information in the premise. the premise only states that the speaker goes to one of these two places, it does not specify why the speaker goes or exclude any potential reasons.therefore, the hypothesis is not logically entailed by the premise, but it does not contradict it either."
4009,"As a cavalry brigadier, he participated in the 1807 Invasion of Portugal but was captured in 1808 and held until 1812.","As a cavalry brigadier, he participated in the 1808 Invasion of Portugal but was captured in 1808 and held until 1812.",0,1,False,"step 1: both the premise and hypothesis describe the same individual, his military rank, and his involvement in the 1807 invasion of portugal, as well as his capture in 1808 and release in 1812. no contradictions or inconsistencies are present between the two statements.step 2: the hypothesis is identical to the premise in all relevant details. consequently, the hypothesis can be logically inferred from the premise as they both express the same factual information.step 3: given the identical content and lack of contradictions, the hypothesis is entailed by the premise."
4010,The bhakti movement of the Tamils brought a new warmth to the hitherto rigid Brahmanic ritual of Hinduism.,The Tamils' bhakti movement froze the previously warm ritual of Hinduism.,0,0,True,"step 1: in the premise, the 'bhakti movement of the tamils' is described as introducing a 'new warmth' to the 'hitherto rigid brahmanic ritual of hinduism'. this implies that the bhakti movement brought about a change, making the ritual more flexible or expressive than before.  step 2: the hypothesis, however, suggests the opposite - that the bhakti movement 'froze' the previously warm ritual of hinduism. this is a contradiction to the premise as it implies that the bhakti movement had a chilling effect instead of a warming one. step 3: based on the given information and the logical inconsistency between the premise and hypothesis, the hypothesis cannot be logically inferred from the premise."
4011,Bosnia (No economic data.,Bosnia has no economic data due to their worthless currency.,1,0,False,"step 1. in the premise, there is no economic data provided about bosnia. however, the hypothesis introduces a new piece of information: bosnia's currency is worthless. step 2. there is no logical connection between the lack of economic data and bosnia's currency being worthless based on the provided information. although it's a common assumption that countries with worthless currencies may have economic instability, this doesn't necessarily mean they have no economic data. step 3. the hypothesis cannot be logically inferred from the premise as there is no sufficient evidence or logical connection between the two statements."
4012,you know but like i said i don't tolerate the heat and the,Heat is very pleasant to me.,0,0,True,"step 1. the premise states that you don't tolerate the heat. this indicates a dislike or intolerance for heat. step 2. the hypothesis suggests that heat is pleasant to the person spoken to. this is directly contradictory to the information provided in the premise. step 3. based on the given premise, the hypothesis cannot be logically inferred. the premise and hypothesis present conflicting information."

4014,and uh trying desperately to uh get ahead with the company,They are attempting to get ahead in the company by working harder.,1,1,True,"step 1: in the premise, the subject 'they' is trying to get ahead with the company. the phrase 'get ahead' can be interpreted as making progress, achieving success, or gaining an advantage. this could be achieved through various means, one of which is working harder.step 2: the hypothesis proposes that the means by which 'they' are trying to get ahead is by working harder. this is a reasonable inference from the premise, as it offers a specific explanation for the general action described in the premise.step 3: based on the logical connection between the premise and hypothesis, and the lack of contradictory information, the hypothesis can be inferred from the premise."
4015,A man wearing chuck taylor shoes and a tan shirt attempts to break free from a straitjacket in front of a crowd,a man in a straight jacket,1,1,True,"step 1: in the premise, we have key information about a man trying to break free from a straitjacket. there is no explicit statement about him being in a straitjacket at the moment, but the attempt implies that he was previously in one. step 2: the hypothesis is a description of a state of being, specifically a man in a straitjacket. this is a possible state for the man described in the premise, as the attempt to break free implies that he was indeed in a straitjacket at some point. step 3: based on the information provided, the hypothesis can be inferred from the premise. the man's actions suggest that he was in a straitjacket at some point, and the hypothesis explicitly states that fact."
4016,"And speaking of eggs, have you ever tried a flemiostrich egg? Very tasty! Czarek was shouting, but without effect.",Have you ever tried a tasty and inexpensive flemiostrich egg? shouted Czarek.,1,0,False,"step 1: in the premise, the speaker is discussing eggs, specifically mentioning a flemiostrich egg and expressing that it is tasty. no information is given about the cost of this egg. in the hypothesis, czarek is shouting about a tasty and inexpensive flemiostrich egg. step 2: the hypothesis does not directly contradict the premise, but it does add the additional information that the flemiostrich egg is inexpensive. this information is not mentioned in the premise, but it is not inconsistent with it either. step 3: based on the given information, the hypothesis cannot be logically inferred from the premise as there is no mention of the cost of the flemiostrich egg in the premise. the hypothesis adds new information that is not implied by the premise. step 4: in conclusion, the hypothesis is not entailed by the premise."

4018,Will Tina's notorious lavishness irk the frugal duo?,What does the frugal duo eat for lunch?,0,0,True,"step 1. in the premise, 'will tina's notorious lavishness irk the frugal duo?' is a question asking about the potential irritation of tina's extravagance towards the 'frugal duo.' no specific information about the frugal duo is provided, not even what they eat for lunch.step 2. the hypothesis, 'what does the frugal duo eat for lunch?' is an entirely unrelated question. there is no logical connection or entailment between the premise and hypothesis.step 3. based on the given information, the hypothesis cannot be logically inferred from the premise."
4019,The hammer he swung must have weighed fifteen stones.,"The hammer was very lightweight, so he swung it.",0,0,True,"step 1: the premise describes the weight of the hammer as fifteen stones, which is an extremely heavy weight for a hammer. common sense and factual knowledge contradict the premise, as a typical hammer is not this heavy. step 2: the hypothesis suggests the opposite of the premise, that the hammer was very lightweight. if the hypothesis is true, then the premise is not. step 3: given the clear contradiction between the premise and hypothesis, there is no logical entailment. the hypothesis cannot be inferred from the premise."
4020,which is why i'm going to enjoy the paralegal field a lot,I don't want any job concerning the law or justice process.,0,0,True,"step 1: in the premise, the speaker expresses their enjoyment for the paralegal field. this does not provide any direct information about their feelings or intentions regarding jobs concerning the law or justice process in general. step 2: the hypothesis contradicts the premise, as it states the opposite of what the premise implies. step 3: based on the given information, the hypothesis cannot be logically inferred from the premise."

4026,uh we thought nothing at all of wake up waking up in the morning hopping into your car grabbing fishing poles and driving four hours,We would just go fishing without any thought.,1,1,True,"step 1: in the premise, the speaker and possibly others engage in the activities of waking up, getting into a car, driving for four hours, and fishing. no contradictory information or logical inconsistencies are present. the hypothesis suggests that these activities were performed without any thought, which could be seen as a description of the state of mind of the individuals involved.step 2: the hypothesis can be inferred from the premise because the premise does not include any information about why or how the decision to go fishing was made. the absence of such information in the premise leaves open the possibility that the decision was made without any thought, as stated in the hypothesis.step 3: based on the lack of contradictory information and the logical possibility that the hypothesis could follow from the premise, the hypothesis can be inferred from the premise."
4027,i can't so right that's the way i am  i know the feeling,"I don't know what that feels like, I have no idea.",0,0,True,"step 1: the premise is a statement expressing that the speaker has difficulty expressing 'right' and acknowledges a similar feeling in others. it does not provide any specific information about the speaker's experiences or knowledge. step 2: the hypothesis is a statement expressing a lack of knowledge or experience concerning a particular feeling. the premise and hypothesis describe different states of knowledge and do not directly relate to one another. step 3: based on the given information, there does not appear to be any logical connection or entailment between the premise and hypothesis.step 4: it is important to note that the lack of entailment does not necessarily imply that the sentences are contradictory or inconsistent. they simply describe different states of knowledge and do not logically follow from one another.label: 0"
4028,i mix all all my flower beds are mixed up i've got onions behind the irises and,My flower beds are mixed up and I put the onions behind the irises and daffodils.,1,1,True,"step 1: in the premise, the speaker mentions that their flower beds are mixed up and there are onions behind the irises. this implies that the speaker has planted onions in a location where irises would typically be found. the hypothesis also states that the flower beds are mixed up and that onions are planted behind irises and daffodils. this suggests that the hypothesis is describing the same scenario as the premise, with the additional detail that daffodils are also present.step 2: the hypothesis can be logically inferred from the premise because it is a more specific version of the premise. the premise sets up a scenario where flower beds are mixed up and onions are behind irises. the hypothesis adds the detail that daffodils are also present in the mixed-up flower beds and that onions are behind both irises and daffodils. this information is consistent with the premise and does not contradict it.step 3: based on this logical reasoning and the lack of contradictory information, the hypothesis can be inferred from the premise as it provides more detailed information about the same scenario."
4029,well thanks thanks for calling bye-bye,I hoped you'd call.,1,0,False,"step 1: in the premise, there is no explicit or implicit information about a desired or expected call. the sentence seems to be a polite way to end a conversation. step 2: the hypothesis 'i hoped you'd call' suggests a desire or expectation for a call. however, it is not a logical consequence of the premise as there is no mention of a hope or expectation in the premise. step 3: based on the given information, the hypothesis 'i hoped you'd call' cannot be logically inferred from the premise 'well thanks thanks for calling bye-bye'."
4030,"kiosks or accessed the programs on the Internet, using home computers.",The programs were accessed via Apple laptops.,1,0,False,"step 1: in the premise, it is stated that kiosks or people accessed programs on the internet using home computers. this implies that the accessing of these programs occurred through a computer interface connected to the internet. no specific type of computer is mentioned in the premise.step 2: the hypothesis suggests that the programs were accessed via apple laptops. this means that the laptops in question are manufactured by apple. apple laptops are indeed computers, and they have internet connectivity, which makes them suitable for accessing programs online. however, the premise does not mention apple laptops specifically.step 3: while the hypothesis is not logically contradictory to the premise, it is not logically entailed either. the hypothesis introduces an additional detail not present in the premise. it is possible for the programs to be accessed using home computers that are not apple laptops. thus, the hypothesis cannot be inferred directly from the premise."
4031,Together we have advocated on behalf of LSC grantees at other federal agencies on issues arising out of other federal grants that the grantees receive.,Women are advocating on behalf of LSC grantees.,1,0,False,"step 1: in the premise, 'we' refers to individuals who have advocated together. there is no explicit mention of the gender of these individuals. however, there is no information to suggest that only men have been involved in these advocacy efforts. step 2: the hypothesis, 'women are advocating on behalf of lsc grantees', is not logically contradictory to the premise. the hypothesis does not change the meaning of the premise or exclude it in any way. step 3: based on the lack of contradictory information and the absence of logical exclusion, it is possible that women are among the individuals who have advocated on behalf of lsc grantees. however, the premise does not entail that only women have advocated, nor does it entail that men have not. therefore, the hypothesis is not logically entailed by the premise.step 4: it is important to note that while the premise does not exclude women from the group of advocates, it also does not affirmatively state that women are part of the group. the hypothesis makes an additional claim that is not explicitly stated or logically deducible from the premise.step 5: in conclusion, the hypothesis is not logically entailed by the premise."
4033,"He added more kefir and home-made kefir flavor, but not too much, because his hands were shaking, then he still had to mix it and add a few E-numbers.",He didn't add anything after mixing the kefir and home-made kefir flavor.,0,0,True,"step 1: in the premise, the man is described as adding more kefir and home-made flavor to the mixture, but he mentions that his hands were shaking, which could imply uncertainty or instability in his actions. he also mentions that he still had to mix the kefir and add a few e-numbers. e-numbers are food additives, so it's clear that he was still performing additional steps in the process.step 2: the hypothesis states that he didn't add anything after mixing the kefir and home-made flavor. this directly contradicts the premise, as the man is explicitly stated to have done something additional after mixing the kefir and adding the home-made flavor.step 3: based on the given information, the hypothesis cannot be logically inferred from the premise, as they contradict each other."
4034,And I  I hearwhat I am safe from.,People are always aligned with what keeps them safe.,1,1,True,"step 1: in the premise, the speaker mentions 'what i am safe from.' this suggests a focus on safety and preservation. in the hypothesis, 'what keeps them safe' refers to the same concept - safety. step 2: the hypothesis can be inferred from the premise as a more generalized and abstract version. the premise describes the speaker's personal experience, while the hypothesis extends this idea to a broader population - 'people.' step 3: there is a logical relationship between the two statements, as the hypothesis can be derived from the premise by applying the concept to a larger group. therefore, the hypothesis is entailed by the premise.step 4: common sense and logical principles support this conclusion. it is a common observation that individuals, including people, seek to protect themselves from harm or danger. the hypothesis captures this idea at a more general level, making it a valid inference from the premise."

4036,"With the overseers they have, you couldn't even turn yourself back to the Satheri, though I'll admit I'm hoping you don't want them to find you.""  ""And I was beginning to think you liked me,"" Dave commented bitterly.",The Satheri have a long-time rivalry with Dave. ,1,0,False,"step 1: the premise indicates that dave is concerned about the overseers preventing him from returning to the satheri, suggesting a negative relationship between dave and the satheri. the context also implies that dave has had some past interaction with the satheri. step 2: a long-standing rivalry is a significant and prolonged conflict between two parties. the premise does not explicitly state a rivalry, but it does suggest a negative relationship. the hypothesis is a logical extrapolation from the given information. step 3: based on the information provided, the hypothesis is a plausible inference from the premise, as it explains the negative relationship between dave and the satheri, but it is not a definitive entailment."
4038,Eszterhas writes movies about naked women and believes himself an artist.,Eszterhaus writes about strong men.,0,0,True,"step 1: the premise states that eszterhas writes movies about naked women and that he believes himself to be an artist. this information does not directly provide any details about the content related to men in his movies or his beliefs regarding them. step 2: the hypothesis suggests that eszterhas writes about strong men, which is different from the information provided in the premise. there is no logical connection between the two statements based on the given information. step 3: without explicit information linking eszterhas's writing about strong men to his movies or beliefs, the hypothesis cannot be logically inferred from the premise."
4039,"But in addition to sampling the products of the cellar masters, visitors will find gourmet meals, wonderful towns, important churches, and dense forests.",The visitors did not find anything of interest.,0,0,True,"step 1: in the premise, it is stated that visitors find various things of interest including gourmet meals, towns, churches, and forests. this implies that the experience of visiting the cellar masters is not only about sampling products but also exploring other attractions. step 2: the hypothesis states that the visitors found nothing of interest. this directly contradicts the information given in the premise. step 3: the hypothesis cannot be logically inferred from the premise since the premise describes a situation where visitors find multiple things of interest, and the hypothesis suggests they found none."
4040,"222 "" 'Ave, Caesar! ",Fuck Caesar!,0,0,True,"step 1: in this example, the premise and hypothesis are presented in natural language that contains strong emotional expressions which are not relevant to logical entailment. the premise appears to be a greeting or salutation to caesar, while the hypothesis expresses a wish for harm to caesar.step 2: the logical relationship between the premise and hypothesis is not directly inferable. the hypothesis does not follow logically from the premise, as the actions expressed are not related. the premise does not imply or suggest the hypothesis in any way.step 3: based on the given information and logical principles, the hypothesis is not entailed by the premise. the emotional expressions do not change the logical relationship between the two statements."
4041,"And put like that, she added confidentially to Tommy, ""nobody could boggle at the expense!"" Nobody did, which was the great thing.",She was always confident with talking to Tommy.,1,1,True,"step 1: the premise describes a situation where a woman, confidentially, makes a comment to tommy about 'nobody could boggle at the expense.' the term 'boggled' implies confusion or surprise, and the fact that 'nobody did' indicates that no one was confused or surprised by what she said. it is common sense that being confident in one's words and actions is often associated with speaking easily and naturally to someone.step 2: the hypothesis proposes that she is always confident when talking to tommy. this hypothesis can be inferred from the premise as the premise shows her being confident in this specific instance of speaking to tommy. there is no contradictory information in the premise that would prevent this inference.step 3: based on the logical connection between the premise and hypothesis, and the lack of contradictory information, the hypothesis can be inferred from the premise."
4043,i'll go ahead and and charge it knowing that the money will be there,"Money will be in my bank account, so I'll charge my debit card.",1,1,True,"step 1: in the premise, the speaker states that they will go ahead and charge something, assuming that there is enough money in their bank account. this implies a belief that the money will be available for the transaction. step 2: the hypothesis states that the money will be in the speaker's bank account before they choose to charge their debit card. this is a logical consequence of the premise, as the premise relies on the assumption that there is sufficient funds. thus, the hypothesis is entailed by the premise. step 3: the hypothesis is a logical consequence of the premise, as it states a necessary condition for the action described in the premise to occur."
4044,In another moment they were standing in a dusty garret littered with lumber.,The attic they found themselves in was dark and musty.,1,1,True,"step 1: in the premise, the scene is described as a dusty garret littered with lumber. a garret is an attic or upper room in a house. the description of the room being dusty suggests a lack of use or cleaning, which can make an area dark and musty if not properly ventilated. common sense and logical connections indicate that a dark and musty attic aligns with the description of a neglected or unused dusty garret. step 2: the hypothesis 'the attic they found themselves in was dark and musty' can be logically inferred from the premise 'in another moment they were standing in a dusty garret littered with lumber'. the hypothesis describes a reasonable and expected condition given the information provided in the premise. step 3: based on the logical connections, common sense reasoning, and consistency with the given information, the hypothesis can be inferred from the premise."
4045,Bush himself couldn't utter these words with a straight face.,Bush said it all with a stoic face. ,0,0,True,"step 1: in the premise, bush is described as being unable to utter certain words with a straight face, suggesting a lack of sincerity or seriousness. this does not provide any direct information about bush's facial expression during the actual speaking event. the hypothesis, on the other hand, directly contradicts the premise by stating that bush spoke with a stoic face, which implies a serious and emotionless expression.step 2: the hypothesis cannot be logically inferred from the premise because the premise does not provide sufficient information to support the hypothesis. the hypothesis goes against the information given in the premise.step 3: based on the logical reasoning, the hypothesis is not entailed by the premise."
4046,well something well so are you a homemaker i guess that's the the right term nowadays,Do you clean houses?,1,1,True,"step 1: in the premise, the speaker identifies themselves as a 'homemaker.' in contemporary language, being a homemaker refers to an individual who manages the household and takes care of domestic responsibilities. this role often includes tasks such as cooking, cleaning, and maintaining a home. step 2: the hypothesis asks if i clean houses. given the definition and common understanding of a homemaker, it is a logical inference that yes, they do clean houses as one of their domestic responsibilities. step 3: based on the logical connection between the definition of a homemaker and the tasks involved, and the direct question in the hypothesis, the hypothesis can be logically inferred from the premise."
4047,yeah we get something on the door about every week,We throw out everything that gets put on our door.,1,0,False,"step 1: in the premise, it is stated that 'we get something on the door about every week.' this suggests a regular occurrence of receiving items on the doorstep. no specific information is given about what is done with these items. step 2: the hypothesis, 'we throw out everything that gets put on our door,' asserts an action taken with the items received. this is a contradiction if the received items are not thrown out but kept. however, without any prior information about what 'we' do with the items, it is not possible to definitively infer that the hypothesis is true or false. step 3: based on the given information, neither entailment nor contradiction can be determined between the premise and hypothesis."
4048,"When single father Thurman Williams needed help filling out papers in a custody suit recently, he didn't look to his lawyer for help.",He felt it would be best to do it on his own in the end.,1,1,True,"step 1: in the premise, thurman williams is stated to have not asked his lawyer for help with filling out papers in a custody suit. this implies that he preferred to handle the matter himself. step 2: the hypothesis suggests that thurman felt it would be best to do it on his own. this conclusion aligns with the information provided in the premise, as both statements indicate thurman's intention to handle the custody suit papers without assistance. step 3: based on the logical connection between the premise and hypothesis, and the absence of contradictory information, the hypothesis can be inferred from the premise."
4049,Why don't you give me one?,Why don't you give me a good slap on my butt.,1,0,False,"step 1: in the premise, the speaker is asking the listener why they are not giving something to the speaker. the meaning of 'one' in this context is ambiguous and could refer to an object or an action. the hypothesis, on the other hand, is a specific request for a physical action. step 2: there is no logical connection between the premise and the hypothesis. the hypothesis cannot be logically inferred from the premise as it introduces a new idea: the speaker is asking for a physical action. step 3: based on the lack of logical connection and the significant difference in meaning between the premise and the hypothesis, the hypothesis is not entailed by the premise."
4050,We know essentially nothing about life beyond Earth.,There is life beyond earth. ,1,0,False,"step 1: the premise states that we know very little about life beyond earth. this means that there is a lack of definitive evidence or knowledge regarding the existence of life beyond earth. step 2: the hypothesis, on the other hand, asserts the existence of life beyond earth. however, the lack of knowledge or evidence in the premise does not logically contradict the hypothesis. in fact, the vastness of the universe and the presence of conditions suitable for life in various parts suggest that the hypothesis could be plausible. step 3: the hypothesis cannot be logically inferred from the premise, as the premise does not provide sufficient evidence to entail the hypothesis. however, the hypothesis remains a reasonable and testable scientific assumption based on our current understanding of the universe."
4051,still a feeling of you know it's not totally wasted dollars if you think about it some of it coming back your way,Some of the money you spent on the car is coming back you way.,1,1,True,"step 1: in the premise, the speaker expresses a belief that some of the money spent on a car is not totally wasted, suggesting that they expect to receive some return on their investment. step 2: the hypothesis aligns with the premise by stating that some of the money spent on the car is indeed coming back to the speaker. this is a logical inference as the premise sets up the expectation for the return of some of the spent money. step 3: the hypothesis is a logical entailment of the premise, as the premise implies the potential for a return on investment, and the hypothesis confirms that such a return is occurring."
4052,"But anyway, never underestimate the power of hypocrisy.",Hypocrisy is a large challenge facing the country.,1,1,True,"step 1: in the premise, 'never underestimate the power of hypocrisy' is an expression of caution about the prevalence and impact of hypocrisy. it does not directly state that hypocrisy is a large challenge, but it implies that it is a significant issue. a challenge is typically something that hinders progress or causes difficulty. step 2: the hypothesis, 'hypocrisy is a large challenge facing the country,' can be reasonably inferred from the premise because the premise suggests that hypocrisy is a significant problem, and the term 'large challenge' strengthens this implication. step 3: based on the logical connection between the premise and hypothesis, and the common-sense understanding of the meaning of both terms, the hypothesis can be inferred from the premise."
4053,have them pick that up but that's the extent of what i've done i'd like to be able to do more the problem is with a lot of it is you have to go you know it takes a while to drive to these places where you recycle it you know it's not always convenient to do it,"""It's not always convenient to recycle because it takes a while to drive to these places and sort out those things.""",1,1,True,"step 1: in the premise, the speaker mentions their desire to do more for recycling but faces inconvenience due to the time and effort required to drive to recycling centers. this suggests that the process of recycling involves traveling to specific locations and sorting the materials. step 2: the hypothesis summarizes this situation by stating that recycling is not always convenient due to the time and sorting required. the hypothesis directly relates to the premise by expressing a similar idea, but it is more general and abstract. step 3: given the logical connection between the premise and hypothesis, and the lack of contradictory information, the hypothesis can be reasonably inferred from the premise. the hypothesis is a more succinct and generalized version of the premise.step 4: it is important to note that the hypothesis does not necessarily mean that the speaker will never recycle, but rather that there are inconveniences that can prevent them from doing it more frequently."
4054,so i i can use that and uh,I cannot use that. ,0,0,True,"step 1: the premise is stating that 'i can use that.' this implies that the speaker has the ability or permission to use an object or information. the hypothesis, on the other hand, states 'i cannot use that.' this indicates a lack of ability or permission to use an object or information.step 2: the hypothesis directly contradicts the premise, as it suggests the opposite action or permission.  therefore, the hypothesis cannot be logically inferred from the premise.step 3: based on the logical reasoning, the hypothesis is not entailed by the premise."
4055,Social Security has a long-term financing problem.,Social Security needs to find alternate financing.,1,1,True,"step 1: the premise indicates that social security has a long-term financing problem, which means that the current funding methods are not sufficient to meet future obligations. this is a well-known issue in the context of social security.step 2: the hypothesis suggests that social security needs to find alternate financing, which can be seen as a response or solution to the long-term financing problem mentioned in the premise. this is a common-sense and logical response to such a situation.step 3: based on the logical reasoning and the common-sense understanding of the situation, the hypothesis can be inferred from the premise."
4056,right right but it gets to the point where i mean you've got to have the time find the time also to read read about the guy and and be able to find the information about what he stands for,It doesn't take much time to research them.,0,0,True,"step 1: in the premise, the speaker emphasizes the need to find time and read about a person in order to understand what they stand for. this implies a significant time investment. step 2: the hypothesis states that it doesn't take much time to research them. this directly contradicts the premise, as 'not taking much time' is the opposite of 'having to find the time'. step 3: based on the logical negation of the premise and the contradictory nature of the hypothesis, it is clear that the hypothesis is not entailed by the premise."
4057,Keeping the peace in the Taiwan Strait must be the United States' top China priority.,The US helped make the Taiwan Straight the most peaceful place in the world.,1,1,True,"step 1: in the premise, it is stated that maintaining peace in the taiwan strait is a top priority for the united states in its china policy. this implies that the united states has a significant interest in ensuring that the taiwan strait remains peaceful.step 2: the hypothesis suggests that the united states played a role in making the taiwan strait the most peaceful place in the world. this is consistent with the premise, as maintaining peace in the taiwan strait aligns with the united states' top china priority.step 3: the hypothesis can be inferred from the premise because the united states' efforts to maintain peace in the taiwan strait could reasonably result in the taiwan strait becoming the most peaceful place in the world. this inference is based on the logical connection between the united states' priority and the outcome, as well as the assumption that the united states has the capability and influence to significantly contribute to peace in the region.therefore, the hypothesis can be reasonably inferred from the premise."
4058,3. Orrin Hatch's resentment,Orrin Hatch resents people not named Orrin.,1,0,False,"step 1. in the given premise, no specific information is provided about orrin hatch's emotions or feelings towards people named orrin or otherwise. the premise only mentions 'orrin hatch's resentment'. step 2. the hypothesis makes a claim about orrin hatch's feelings towards people not named orrin. however, the premise does not logically imply or entail this claim. there is no information given about hatch's emotions or feelings towards anyone other than himself. step 3. based on the given premise, the hypothesis cannot be logically inferred."
4059,'Go now.',Stay. ,0,0,True,"step 1: the premise 'go now.' is a direct command meaning to leave or go away immediately. it does not contain any information about the subject or context that could reasonably imply the hypothesis 'stay'. in fact, the two sentences mean opposite actions. step 2: the hypothesis 'stay' is the opposite of the action suggested by the premise 'go now'. therefore, the hypothesis cannot be logically inferred from the premise. step 3: based on the logical negation of the actions and the absence of common sense or factual grounds that could connect the premise and hypothesis, the hypothesis is not entailed by the premise."
4060,High sensitivity ensures that most of the patients with problems will be detected.,Equipment sensitivity is unrelated to problem detection.,0,0,True,"step 1: in the premise, 'high sensitivity' refers to the ability of a diagnostic tool or test to identify a condition or issue in a large number of cases. this is a desirable quality as it increases the chances of detecting problems in patients. step 2: the hypothesis states that 'equipment sensitivity' is 'unrelated' to problem detection. however, the term 'equipment sensitivity' is not defined in the context provided. it could refer to a few different things, such as the sensitivity of the diagnostic equipment itself or the sensitivity of the equipment users. step 3: without a clear definition or context for 'equipment sensitivity' in the hypothesis, it is difficult to make a definitive conclusion about its relationship to problem detection based on the given premise alone. it is possible that high sensitivity equipment could lead to more problem detections, but it is also possible that other factors, such as user skill or test interpretation, could influence problem detection independent of equipment sensitivity. without additional information, it is neither possible to confirm that the hypothesis is entailed by the premise nor to definitively reject it."
4061,"Application may be made to a single asset, a group of assets, or an entire enterprise, as determined by various bases and methods.",It can be only one single asset.,0,0,True,"step 1: in the premise, it is stated that an application may be made to a single asset, a group of assets, or an entire enterprise. this indicates that there is flexibility in choosing the scope of the application. step 2: the hypothesis, however, restricts this flexibility by stating that it can only be one single asset. this is a contradiction to the premise as it limits the scope to less than what is allowed. step 3: based on the given premise, the hypothesis cannot be logically inferred as it contradicts the stated flexibility."
4062,yeah he did have a problem uh when he went camping last year in uh Beavers Bend Oklahoma Oklahoma Oklahoma Oklahoma um a storm a storm came in and it started raining really heavy and they were all everybody was trying to flee the campsite and everybody was getting stuck in the mud,It was an unpleasant experience.,1,1,True,"step 1: in the premise, a description of an unpleasant camping experience during heavy rain in beavers bend, oklahoma is provided. the situation involves people getting stuck in the mud and trying to flee the campsite. common sense and logical understanding of the situation indicate that this experience would be unpleasant. there are no factual contradictions or inconsistencies in the premise.step 2: the hypothesis 'it was an unpleasant experience' accurately conveys the information from the premise, as the premise itself describes the event as such. the hypothesis can be logically inferred from the premise as it captures the essential meaning of the situation described.step 3: based on the logical reasoning, common sense understanding, and the consistency between the premise and hypothesis, the hypothesis can be inferred from the premise."
4063,or seven uh that's kind of far away,Seven is really close.,0,0,True,"step 1: in the premise, 'seven is kind of far away' indicates that the number seven is located at a distance that can be considered 'far away'. this is a descriptive statement based on a relative term 'kind of far away'. step 2: the hypothesis 'seven is really close' directly contradicts the premise by stating that seven is not far away but close instead. this contradiction makes it impossible for the hypothesis to be logically inferred from the premise. step 3: based on the logical negation of the hypothesis and the contradictory nature of the hypothesis with respect to the premise, the hypothesis is not entailed by the premise."
4064,"When ordering, it is customary to be taken to the kitchen to look at the various dishes you will find printed menus only in tourist restaurants.",The tourists restaurants don't have any printed menus.,0,1,False,"step 1: in the premise, it is mentioned that only in tourist restaurants, printed menus are not shown to customers while ordering, instead, they are taken to the kitchen to look at the dishes. this implies that in these restaurants, dishes are displayed for selection instead of having a printed menu. step 2: the hypothesis suggests that tourist restaurants don't have any printed menus at all. this is consistent with the information identified in the premise, as the absence of printed menus during the ordering process is a common characteristic of tourist restaurants. step 3: based on the logical reasoning and the consistency between the premise and hypothesis, the hypothesis can be inferred from the premise."
4065,"He invited me to his wedding, though I was unable to attend.",I had business to take care of on his wedding day.,1,0,False,"step 1: in the premise, 'he invited me to his wedding, though i was unable to attend.', the key information is that the speaker was invited to the wedding but couldn't attend. this does not necessarily imply a reason for not attending. step 2: the hypothesis, 'i had business to take care of on his wedding day', suggests a reason for not attending the wedding. step 3: there are no logical contradictions between the premise and hypothesis, nor are there any factual inconsistencies. it is a common occurrence for people to miss weddings due to prior commitments or obligations. thus, the hypothesis is not necessarily a logical deduction from the premise but can be considered a plausible explanation for the speaker's absence. step 4: however, the hypothesis goes beyond the information provided in the premise as it introduces a new piece of information (the business). therefore, it cannot be logically inferred from the premise, but it may be an acceptable explanation for the scenario described in the premise.step 5: based on the given information, logical principles, and common-sense reasoning, the hypothesis is not logically entailed by the premise but can be considered a plausible alternative reason for the speaker's absence from the wedding."
4067,The church may then be marked out to designate where worshippers of the various denominations take their place.,All churches are single-denominational. ,0,0,True,"step 1: in the premise, it is mentioned that 'worshippers of the various denominations' use different marked out places in a church. this implies that there are multiple denominations present at the church. common sense and factual knowledge also support the existence of multi-denominational churches. step 2: the hypothesis states 'all churches are single-denominational.' this directly contradicts the premise since the premise acknowledges the presence of multiple denominations at 'the church.' step 3: based on the logical contradiction between the premise and hypothesis, the hypothesis cannot be inferred from the premise.step 4: an additional consideration is the fact that the hypothesis is a generalization about all churches, while the premise is specific to 'the church.' it's important to note that a hypothesis cannot be inferred from a premise if the hypothesis is a more general statement than the premise.in conclusion, the hypothesis cannot be logically inferred from the premise since it contradicts the premise and is a more general statement."
4068,Dissenters congratulate Quindlen for having moved beyond veiled autobiography.,Quindlen has been universally criticized.,0,0,True,"step 1: the premise states that dissenters have congratulated quindlen for moving beyond veiled autobiography. this implies that quindlen's writing style has evolved and that some people appreciate this change. step 2: the hypothesis, 'quindlen has been universally criticized', contradicts the premise. if quindlen had been universally criticized, it would not make sense for dissenters to congratulate her for moving beyond a certain style. step 3: based on the logical contradiction between the premise and hypothesis, the hypothesis cannot be inferred from the premise."
4069,"Therefore, the cost of the candidate mail becomes 16.","In that case, the cost of the candidate mail becomes 2500.",0,0,True,"step 1. in the premise, there is no information provided about the cost of the candidate mail other than it becoming 16. the hypothesis introduces a new value of 2500 for the cost of the candidate mail. step 2. the hypothesis contradicts the premise, as the hypothesis presents a different value for the cost of the candidate mail than what is stated in the premise. there is no logical connection or justification in the premise or common-sense reasoning that would allow the hypothesis to be inferred. step 3. based on the logical analysis, the hypothesis cannot be inferred from the premise as it presents new and contradictory information."
4070,Glendalough's three nature trails take less than an hour's relaxed walking and are well worth doing.,The nature trails are full of wildlife and good-smelling flowers.,1,1,True,"step 1: in the premise, it is mentioned that glendalough's nature trails are worth doing and they take less than an hour for relaxed walking. this suggests that the trails are accessible and enjoyable. it is a common experience that natural environments, especially those worth visiting, often have diverse wildlife and fragrant flowers. step 2: the hypothesis, stating that the nature trails are full of wildlife and good-smelling flowers, can be inferred from the premise due to the logical connection between the worth of the nature trails and the presence of attractive natural features like wildlife and flowers. this inference is supported by commonsense understanding and general knowledge about nature trails. step 3: based on the logical reasoning, commonsense understanding, and lack of contradictory information in the premise, the hypothesis can be inferred from the premise."
4072,Napoleon was fond of Fon?­taine?­bleau and he refurnished the pal?­ace after the looting of the Revolution.,Napoleon spent a lot of money on the refurnishing of the palace.,1,1,True,"step 1: in the premise, it is mentioned that napoleon was fond of fonthilleau and refurnished the palace after the looting of the revolution. the refurnishing of the palace implies spending a significant amount of money on it, as refurnishing involves buying new furniture, art, and other decorations. step 2: the hypothesis 'napoleon spent a lot of money on the refurnishing of the palace' is a logical consequence of the given premise, as the premise establishes that napoleon indeed undertook the refurnishing project, which necessarily involved a substantial financial investment. step 3: based on the logical relationship between the premise and hypothesis, and the absence of contradictory information, the hypothesis can be inferred from the premise."
4073,"A recently released Soviet document implicates Theodore Hall, a physicist at Cambridge University.",The Soviet documents implicate Theodore Hall of a crime originating from the cold war era.,1,1,True,"step 1: in the premise, it is stated that a soviet document implicates theodore hall. 'implicates' implies that there is evidence or information suggesting involvement or guilt. the soviet documents are related to the cold war era. step 2: the hypothesis also mentions that the documents implicate theodore hall, but it explicitly states that the implication is of a crime 'originating from the cold war era'. since the premise already establishes the existence and relevance of soviet documents implicating theodore hall, and the hypothesis only adds the context that this relates to a crime from the cold war era, the hypothesis can be logically inferred from the premise. step 3: based on the logical connection between the premise and hypothesis, the hypothesis can be inferred from the premise."
4074,"and then jumping up and down in his chair and crying, Evidence!","This is evidence- him crying and jumping up and down in his chair, but they refuse to see it.",1,1,True,"step 1: in the premise, there is a description of an action sequence where a person is crying and jumping up and down in a chair. this sequence of actions can be considered as expressing emotions, which is a common human behavior. no contradictory information is provided in the premise. step 2: the hypothesis also describes the same actions as evidence. the terms 'evidence' and 'but they refuse to see it' in the hypothesis do not contradict the information provided in the premise. step 3: based on the logical equivalence of the actions described in the premise and hypothesis, the hypothesis can be inferred from the premise as it does not add or contradict any information."
4076,"You were also usually a darned nuisance, fond as I was of you.","I never liked you, even though you didn't get in the way.",0,1,False,"step 1: the premise expresses a complex emotional relationship between the speaker and the person they are addressing. it implies a fondness or affection, but also a nuisance or annoyance. step 2: the hypothesis suggests a lack of liking or positive feelings towards the person. at first glance, this seems to contradict the premise, as it does not align with the expressed fondness. however, it's important to consider the nuisance aspect mentioned in the premise. a person might be annoyed or find someone a nuisance but still not actively dislike them. in fact, it's common for people to have complex relationships with others that involve both positive and negative emotions. step 3: based on the logical principles of ambiguity and the common-sense understanding of complex emotional relationships, the hypothesis can be inferred from the premise. it's possible for someone to both find someone a nuisance and not actively like them, even as they express fondness in other ways."
4077,yeah flowers during the summer down here the the normal kind of flowers there's very few of them that'll really do well everything does real well here in the spring until about oh first part of June and then the real the heat sets in,Normal kinds of flowers do really well during the summer around here.,0,0,True,"step 1. the premise describes the normal flower growing conditions in a particular location, stating that very few normal kinds of flowers do well during the summer due to the heat. it also mentions that everything does well during the spring. step 2. the hypothesis asserts that normal kinds of flowers do well during the summer in that same location. step 3. contradiction exists between the premise and the hypothesis since the premise states that very few normal flowers do well in summer, while the hypothesis claims that they do. step 4. based on the given information, the hypothesis is not logically entailed by the premise as it contradicts it."
4078,and amazingly enough you're you're into Middle Eastern sort of coins the the largest amount of fakes of US gold is made in Lebanon,Most fakes of US gold are manufactured in Lebanon due to the lack of counterfeit laws over there.,1,1,True,"step 1. in the premise, it is mentioned that 'amazingly enough' and 'maddeningly' the largest amount of fakes of us gold is made in lebanon. this indicates an unexpected or unusual fact. the context does not provide any information about the reason why this is the case. the hypothesis suggests that this is due to the lack of counterfeit laws in lebanon.step 2. the hypothesis can be logically inferred from the premise if the lack of counterfeit laws in lebanon is a known cause or explanation for the production of most fakes of us gold. while the premise does not directly state this, it is a reasonable assumption based on common knowledge and logical reasoning. countries with weak or non-existent counterfeit laws often become hubs for counterfeit production due to the lack of legal consequences.step 3. based on the information provided and the logical reasoning, the hypothesis can be inferred from the premise with a reasonable degree of certainty. it is important to note that this does not definitively prove that the hypothesis is true, as there may be other factors at play or additional context that could change the situation. but given the information provided, the hypothesis is a logical inference."
4079,and i i guess i see such a contrast like as opposed to the Middle East War we just had where President Bush went out and got worldwide support for for what was happening,The support is the same as the Middle East war.,0,0,True,"step 1: in the premise, there is a description of a contrast between the current situation and the middle east war, specifically mentioning that president bush had obtained worldwide support for the middle east war. step 2: the hypothesis, on the other hand, asserts that the support for the current situation is the same as the middle east war. however, the premise does not provide any information that directly supports this assertion. it only mentions that there was worldwide support for the middle east war. step 3: based on the information provided, it is not logically entailed that the support for the current situation is the same as the middle east war. the lack of specific details about the current situation and the differences in context between the two situations make it an unreasonable inference. therefore, the hypothesis is not entailed by the premise."
4080,may be more productive if you're comfortable with what your wearing and can be be feel more relaxed whereas uh,The chemical plant required workers to wear protective suits.,1,0,False,"step 1: in the premise, the speaker mentions that being productive might depend on one's comfort level and relaxation. this implies a personal preference or situation where feelings matter. in contrast, the hypothesis describes a situation where workers are required to wear protective suits at a chemical plant. this is an objective requirement in a professional or industrial setting, unrelated to comfort or relaxation.step 2: the premise does not logically entail the hypothesis. the premise concerns individuals' comfort and relaxation, while the hypothesis is about a requirement for protective suits. these concepts are distinct and not directly related.step 3: based on the logical analysis, there is no entailment relationship between the premise and hypothesis."
4081,Children use crayons to color sheets of paper.,Kids color paper with crayon.,1,1,True,"step 1: in the premise, children are stated to use crayons for coloring paper. this indicates an action of coloring paper with crayons. the terms 'children' and 'kids' can be considered interchangeable in this context.step 2: the hypothesis also indicates the action of coloring paper, but with the term 'kids'. this term is synonymous with 'children' in this context. the verb 'color' in both premise and hypothesis has the same meaning and implies the use of a coloring tool, such as a crayon.step 3: based on the semantic similarity and the interchangeability of terms between the premise and hypothesis, it can be inferred that the hypothesis is logically entailed by the premise."
4082,"Legal Aid of the Bluegrass, which serves the Lexington area and northern Kentucky, could not be reached for an estimate on its cuts.",The Legal Aid serves a massive spanning area.,1,0,False,"step 1: in the premise, it is mentioned that legal aid of the bluegrass, which operates in the lexington area and northern kentucky, could not be reached for an estimate on its cuts. this statement does not provide any direct information about the size or scope of the area served by legal aid beyond lexington and northern kentucky. step 2: the hypothesis, 'the legal aid serves a massive spanning area', is not logically entailed by the given premise. the hypothesis contradicts the premise as it implies that legal aid serves a larger area than just lexington and northern kentucky, but the premise does not provide enough information to infer this. step 3: based on the given information, there is no logical entailment between the premise and hypothesis."
4083,right right it's just it's just uh like a necessary evil i mean when we when our children were younger when they were like four years old three years old five years old we we just had Sesame Street and that was about it you know,Sesame Street was just one of many programs to watch when our kids were younger.,0,1,False,"step 1: in the premise, the speaker mentions that when their children were younger, they mostly relied on sesame street as a source of entertainment. this indicates that sesame street was a significant part of their children's media consumption during that period. step 2: the hypothesis suggests that sesame street was 'just one of many programs' that they watched. this statement does not directly contradict the premise, but it does expand upon it, allowing for the possibility that there were other programs in addition to sesame street. step 3: based on the information provided, it seems reasonable that the speaker may have eventually introduced their children to other programs as they grew older. the hypothesis can be inferred from the premise, as it does not contradict it but rather adds context and additional details.step 4: common sense and real-world knowledge support the inference, as it is generally accepted that children's media consumption can include more than one program. this is a common practice when parents or caregivers aim to provide a well-rounded media diet for their children.therefore, the hypothesis can be logically inferred from the premise, but it provides additional context and details."
4084,"The 1994 edition does note, in passing, that the U.S. incarceration rate, 4.55 people per 100,000, is ten times higher than that of Japan, Sweden, Ireland, and the Netherlands.",The US has more people in prison than any other country.,1,0,False,"step 1: the premise states that the u.s. has a higher incarceration rate than japan, sweden, ireland, and the netherlands. it does not mention the total number of people in prison in the u.s. or any other country. however, the premise does provide enough context for us to make an informed assumption about the relative number of people in prison between the u.s. and the countries mentioned.step 2: the hypothesis, claiming the us has more people in prison than any other country, is a stronger statement than what is mentioned in the premise. while the premise states that the u.s. has a higher incarceration rate than several other countries, it does not explicitly state that the u.s. has the highest total number of people in prison.step 3: based on the information provided, the hypothesis cannot be logically inferred from the premise. the premise indicates that the u.s. has a higher incarceration rate compared to several countries, but it does not definitively prove that the u.s. has the highest number of people in prison. therefore, the hypothesis goes beyond the information given in the premise."
4085,"Usually, Clinton finds a way to reconcile the presidential and the political.",Clinton always finds a way to cause a rift between the people. ,0,0,True,"step 1: in the premise, it is stated that clinton 'usually finds a way to reconcile the presidential and the political.' this implies that clinton has the ability to bring people together in her role as president and in her political career. step 2: the hypothesis, 'clinton always finds a way to cause a rift between the people,' contradicts the premise. while the premise suggests that clinton reconciles differences, the hypothesis suggests that she causes discord. there is no logical connection between the two statements. step 3: based on the given information, the hypothesis cannot be logically inferred from the premise."
4086,"This is a sporting town when the wagons come in, and they're due tomorrow.",The wagons are going to show up after lunch tomorrow.,1,0,False,"step 1: in the premise, it is mentioned that the wagons are coming in and they are 'due tomorrow'. this implies that the wagons are expected to arrive on that day. no specific information about the time of the arrival is given. step 2: in the hypothesis, it is suggested that the wagons are going to show up 'after lunch tomorrow'. this is consistent with the premise since the wagons are expected to arrive tomorrow, and no earlier than that. however, the hypothesis adds the additional detail that the arrival will occur 'after lunch'. this detail is not explicitly stated in the premise but is not contradictory to it either. step 3: based on the given information and logical principles, the hypothesis can be seen as a reasonable refinement of the premise. it does not contradict the premise but provides more detail about the expected arrival time. therefore, the hypothesis is not logically entailed by the premise, but it can be seen as a reasonable inference based on the given context."
4087,and uh my daughter gets irate when i when i do that because you know she's a teenager,My daughter does sometimes have reason to be upset.,1,1,True,"step 1: in the premise, the speaker mentions that their daughter gets irate when they do something that is not specified. this suggests a situation where the speaker's actions may have caused offense or harm to their daughter. step 2: the hypothesis states that the daughter sometimes has reason to be upset, which aligns with the information in the premise. it is a reasonable assumption that a teenager might have valid reasons for becoming upset, given the developmental and emotional challenges commonly faced during adolescence. step 3: based on the logical reasoning and common sense understanding of adolescent development, the hypothesis can be inferred from the premise."
4088,The analysis describes and illustrates the impact of the rule on various types of rural and urban hospitals.,The impact of the rule was always bigger on the rural hospitals.,1,0,False,"step 1: in the premise, it is stated that the analysis describes and illustrates the impact of a rule on various types of hospitals, both rural and urban. this suggests that the analysis provides evidence or information about the effects of the rule on each type of hospital. step 2: the hypothesis makes a claim about the magnitude of the rule's impact on rural hospitals compared to urban hospitals. it does not directly contradict the premise, but it does require additional information to determine its validity. if there is evidence in the analysis that consistently shows a larger impact on rural hospitals, then the hypothesis could be inferred. step 3: to evaluate the hypothesis, we would need to review the specific details and evidence presented in the analysis. if the analysis provides consistent evidence that the rule had a bigger impact on rural hospitals, then the hypothesis can be inferred from the premise. if the evidence is mixed or contradictory, or if the analysis does not address the impact on hospital types specifically, then the hypothesis cannot be inferred and would require additional evidence. step 4: based on the given information, it is not possible to make a definitive conclusion without reviewing the specific analysis. therefore, the label is set to 0 for no entailment."
4089,Only universal peace can mess things up now.,Universal peace will solve everything.,0,1,False,"step 1: the premise states that only universal peace can cause issues at the current moment. this implies that peace, in general, is a desirable state. step 2: the hypothesis suggests that universal peace will solve everything. this means that peace is seen as a solution to various problems. step 3: given that both the premise and hypothesis share the common theme of peace, it can be inferred that the hypothesis is a positive outcome or a logical consequence of the premise. the hypothesis does not contradict the premise but rather extends its meaning. step 4: in common sense, peace is generally considered a beneficial state for resolving conflicts and improving relationships among individuals and nations. therefore, the hypothesis 'universal peace will solve everything' can be reasonably inferred from the premise 'only universal peace can mess things up now'.step 5: it is essential to note that the hypothesis does not guarantee that all problems will be completely solved, but it suggests that peace is a crucial step in addressing various issues. achieving peace is often the foundation for finding lasting solutions to complex problems.step 6: the hypothesis does not entail the premise in a strict sense, but it does follow logically from the premise based on the given context and common sense understanding."
4090,"It was directly opposite the left-handed door and, owing to its angle, it also commanded a good view of the upper part of the staircase.",You could see both the staircase and the door,1,1,True,"step 1: in the premise, the description 'it was directly opposite the left-handed door' and 'it also commanded a good view of the upper part of the staircase' implies that 'it' is a position or object that is located facing the door with a clear line of sight towards the upper part of the staircase. no contradictory information is provided in the premise or hypothesis.step 2: the hypothesis 'you could see both the staircase and the door' suggests that there is a viewpoint or observer who can perceive both the staircase and the door at the same time. since the premise describes a position or object with a clear line of sight towards both the staircase and the door, it is a logical inference that 'you could see both the staircase and the door' from the premise.step 3: based on the logical reasoning and lack of contradictory information, the hypothesis can be inferred from the premise."
4091,"So, I had no idea of what action the Governors might take.",The government could take either action. ,1,0,False,"step 1: in the premise, the speaker expresses ignorance about the actions that the governors might take. this implies a situation of uncertainty regarding the potential actions of the governors. the hypothesis suggests that there are only two possible actions.  step 2: given the premise's uncertainty about the governors' actions, it does not contradict or logically entail the hypothesis. the hypothesis is not a violation of logic or factual consistency with the premise. step 3: the hypothesis, 'the government could take either action,' is a neutral statement that is consistent with the uncertainty expressed in the premise. therefore, it is not logically inferred from the premise, but it is not logically contradictory either."
4092,It is currently the third largest political party in Romania after the 2016 legislative elections and the only outspoken pro-LGBT party in the country.,It is currently the third largest political party in Romania after the 2017 legislative elections and the only outspoken pro-LGBT party in the country.,0,0,True,"step 1: the premise establishes that a specific political party is the third largest after the 2016 elections and the only pro-lgbt party in romania. this information is factual and there are no known contradictions. step 2: the hypothesis is identical to the premise with the exception of the year '2017' instead of '2016'. the logical relationship between the two sentences is that if a statement is true for a particular year, it does not necessarily mean it is true for the next year. however, without additional context or information, there is no reason to assume that the political party's status changed. step 3: based on the given information, the hypothesis cannot be logically inferred from the premise as it is not an entailed conclusion. the premise only establishes that the political party held that position in 2016."
4093,Who is he? asked Ca'daan.,Ca'daan didn't ask anyone who he was. ,0,0,True,"step 1: the premise 'who is he?' indicates that ca'daan asked a question to inquire about the identity of someone. no specific information is given about whether anyone else was present or not during this exchange. step 2: the hypothesis 'ca'daan didn't ask anyone who he was' contradicts the premise because it states that ca'daan didn't ask any question related to someone's identity. step 3: based on the logical negation of the premise, the hypothesis cannot be inferred from the premise as it presents a contradictory statement."
4094,"Given the increasing shortage of IT professionals in the current market environment, securing an effective, responsive technology management workforce is a challenging task for both business and government organizations alike.","In the current market, there's an overabundance of IT professionals.",0,0,True,"step 1: in the premise, it is stated that there's an increasing shortage of it professionals, which implies a lack of sufficient it professionals to meet the demands of businesses and governments. step 2: the hypothesis suggests an overabundance of it professionals, which is directly contradictory to the premise as it implies the opposite situation. step 3: based on the logical reasoning and the clear contradiction between the premise and hypothesis, the hypothesis is not logically entailed by the premise."
4095,"The Centre was officially opened on 15 June 1972 by Anthony Eden, one time MP for Leamington and Warwick and Prime Minister of the UK.","The Centre was officially opened on 15 June 1972 by Anthony Eden, one time MP for Seacliff and Warwick and Prime Minister of the UK.",0,1,False,"step 1: in the premise, it is stated that the centre was officially opened on a specific date by a named individual, who is identified as anthony eden, an mp for leamington and warwick and the former prime minister of the uk. in the hypothesis, the same event (the official opening of the centre) is described with the same date and the same named individual, but with a different location identifier for anthony eden (mp for seacliff and warwick). no contradictory information is presented.step 2: the hypothesis can be logically inferred from the premise because both statements refer to the same event and the same individual, with the only difference being the specific location identifier for anthony eden. since the location identifier does not affect the logical validity of the statements, the hypothesis can be considered a logical consequence of the premise.step 3: based on the logical equivalence between the premise and the hypothesis, the hypothesis can be inferred from the premise."
4096,LEETLE GIRLS.,The girls are just babies.,1,0,False,"step 1: leetle is a phonetic representation of the word 'little' in leet speak. the premise is likely referring to girls being described as 'little' or small in size. there is no explicit information indicating the girls' ages.step 2: 'the girls are just babies' is a statement about the girls being young and inexperienced, which is not directly logically inferable from 'leetle girls'. there is a semantic relationship between 'little' and 'babies', but the premise does not provide enough context or information to definitively infer that the girls are babies.step 3: based on the given information, the hypothesis 'the girls are just babies' is not logically entailed by the premise 'leetle girls'."
4097,What kind of a row?,What type of row do I need to buy?,1,0,False,"step 1. in the premise, 'what kind of a row?' is an open-ended question asking for identification or classification of a specific row. it does not provide any context or information about the subject of the row. the hypothesis, 'what type of row do i need to buy,' is also a question, but it is a query for information about a required purchase.step 2. the hypothesis cannot be logically inferred from the premise because the hypothesis presents additional information not contained within the premise. the premise does not provide enough context or information to infer the need to buy a row or the type of row required.step 3. based on the given information, the hypothesis is not entailed by the premise."
4098,you know because then that that way they'll they'll get rid of they can help the alkies and then they can help the people that's on drugs,This way the people who are on drugs can be sent out as soon as possible.,0,0,True,"step 1. in the premise, 'they' are taking an approach ('that way') to help alcoholics and people on drugs. the context suggests that this approach is intended to improve their situation. however, the specifics of the approach are not mentioned.step 2. in the hypothesis, it's stated that 'this way' the people on drugs 'can be sent out as soon as possible.' the term 'sent out' could mean released from a treatment facility. whether this is a reasonable inference from the premise depends on the details of the approach.step 3. based on the given information, it's not possible to definitively say whether the hypothesis is logically entailed by the premise or not. more context is needed to make an informed decision."
4099,"Additions to the 2002 Request for Proposal (RFP) include questions for applicants on staff diversity, recruitment and retention strategies and training, and the organization's strategic planning.",The request for proposal was in 1995.,0,0,True,"step 1: in the premise, it is clear that there were additions made to the 2002 request for proposal (rfp). these additions relate to staff diversity, recruitment and retention strategies, training, and strategic planning. no specific date other than 2002 is mentioned in the premise regarding when the rfp was originally issued. step 2: the hypothesis asserts that the rfp was issued in 1995, but the premise does not provide any evidence or logical connection to support this. in fact, the premise contradicts the hypothesis, as it specifically states that the rfp was in 2002 and that there were additions made to it at that time. step 3: based on the given information, the hypothesis 'the request for proposal was in 1995' cannot be logically inferred from the premise 'additions to the 2002 request for proposal (rfp) include questions for applicants on staff diversity, recruitment and retention strategies and training, and the organization’s strategic planning'. instead, the hypothesis is contradictory to the premise."
4100,young female in striped shirt holding baby boy with red striped outfit,Young woman holding baby boy.,1,1,True,"step 1: in the premise, we have key information about a young female, her clothing (striped shirt), and her action of holding a baby boy. the baby boy is also described in terms of his clothing (red striped outfit). no logical connections or contradictions are present in this information. the hypothesis is more general, as it does not specify the female's clothing, but only her status as a young woman. the actions described in both the premise and hypothesis are equivalent as they both involve the young woman holding a baby. step 2: the hypothesis can be logically inferred from the premise as the holding of a baby by a young woman is a sub-concept of the holding of a baby by a young woman in a striped shirt. step 3: based on the logical relationship between the concepts in the premise and hypothesis, the hypothesis can be inferred from the premise."
4101,okay well it's good it's good talking to you okay bye-bye,I have to go back to work now. ,1,1,True,"step 1: in the premise, the speaker indicates that they are ending the conversation. it is common sense that people often end conversations to attend to other commitments or return to work. the hypothesis suggests that the speaker needs to go back to work. step 2: the hypothesis can be logically inferred from the premise because the stated reason for ending the conversation ('i have to go back to work') indicates that the speaker intends to return to their work duties. this directly matches the scenario suggested by the hypothesis. step 3: based on the logical connection between the premise and hypothesis, and the common-sense understanding of why people might end conversations to attend to work, the hypothesis is a logical inference from the premise."
4102,"As you move further into the complex look for statues of King Tutankhamun and his wife, one of only a few depicting the young boy Pharaoh to be found at his capital.",Tutankhamum died at a very young age.,1,1,True,"step 1: the premise describes king tutankhamun as a young boy pharaoh whose statues are rarely found at his capital. this information implies that tutankhamun likely died at a young age, as indicated by the description of him as a 'boy' and the rarity of statues of him.step 2: the hypothesis 'tutankhamun died at a young age' can be logically inferred from the premise because the description of tutankhamun as a 'boy pharaoh' and the rarity of his statues suggest that he had a short reign and thus died young.step 3: based on the logical connection between the premise and hypothesis, and the common-sense understanding that a 'boy pharaoh' is likely to have a short reign, the hypothesis can be inferred from the premise."
4104,A good shorthand name for the Democratic fund-raising/Lincoln Bedroom/John Huang set of controversies seems as elusive as the story itself.,The Lincoln Bedroom controversies talk about Lincoln's secret male lover.,1,0,False,"step 1: analyzing the premise, it refers to a series of controversies involving democratic fund-raising, the lincoln bedroom, and john huang. these controversies are complex and lack a simple, universally accepted name. no information in the premise suggests anything about lincoln having a secret male lover.step 2: the hypothesis, on the other hand, makes a specific and unrelated claim about lincoln having a secret male lover. there is no logical relationship or entailment between the premise and the hypothesis. the hypothesis is not a reasonable or necessary inference from the premise.step 3: based on the lack of logical connection and the factual inconsistency, the hypothesis cannot be inferred from the premise."
4105,Inland settlements offer fascinating insights into life in bygone ages.,Inland settlements are used to determine the religious beliefs of ancient settlers.,1,1,True,"step 1: the premise describes inland settlements as offering valuable information about past civilizations. this implies a rich historical context. step 2: the hypothesis suggests that the religious beliefs of ancient settlers can be inferred or determined from the study of inland settlements. this is a reasonable inference since religious practices are often reflected in the architecture, artifacts, and other remnants found in archaeological sites and settlements. step 3: based on the logical reasoning, common sense understanding, and the fact that religious practices are often evident in archaeological sites, the hypothesis can be inferred from the premise.step 4: it is also worth noting that while the premise does not explicitly mention religion, the hypothesis does not contradict the premise. instead, it adds a specific aspect to the broader historical insights that can be gained from studying inland settlements."
4106,"What becomes of your theories, then?""",What happens with your ideas if you are proven wrong?,1,1,True,"step 1: the premise is asking about the consequences or outcomes of theories. it implies that theories have some sort of result or impact. the hypothesis is also asking about outcomes, specifically what happens when theories are proven wrong.step 2: the hypothesis can be logically inferred from the premise as the premise suggests that theories have consequences, and being proven wrong is a possible outcome of having a theory. therefore, the hypothesis describes a specific consequence of theories mentioned in the premise.step 3: based on the logical relationship and the context of the questions, the hypothesis is entailed by the premise."
4107,He rose as they entered.,Their entry prompted him to stand.,1,1,True,"step 1: the premise states that 'he rose' when 'they entered'. this indicates that there is a causal relationship between 'their entry' and 'him rising'. it is a common occurrence for people or things to rise or stand up in response to an entrance or arrival of others. this information is consistent and does not contradict any logical principles or common-sense understanding.step 2: the hypothesis 'their entry prompted him to stand' expresses the same causal relationship as the premise but in a more explicit and clearer way. since the premise implies the hypothesis, the hypothesis can be logically inferred from the premise.step 3: based on the logical connections identified in the premise and the explicit statement of the relationship in the hypothesis, the hypothesis is a logical entailment of the premise."
4108,yeah but the politics the politics gets worse in the small towns sometimes,There are some parts of the politics that are worse than others.,1,1,True,"step 1: in the premise, the speaker acknowledges that politics can get worse in small towns. this suggests that there are degrees of 'worseness' in politics. the hypothesis states that 'there are some parts of the politics that are worse than others'. this is a logical implication of the premise, as the premise already implies that not all parts of politics are equally bad.step 2: the hypothesis can be logically inferred from the premise since the premise provides the context for the hypothesis and the hypothesis is a specific instance of the more general idea presented in the premise.step 3: based on the logical connection between the premise and hypothesis, and the lack of contradictory information, the hypothesis can be inferred from the premise."
4109,"This is another way of saying that in the last 30 years, the people who owned America have lost 40 percent of their wealth held in the form of equity.",Americans will keep losing their wealth in the next decade or so.,1,0,False,"step 1: in the premise, it is stated that americans have lost 40 percent of their wealth held in the form of equity over the last 30 years. this implies a significant decrease in wealth for american citizens. step 2: the hypothesis suggests that americans will continue to lose their wealth in the next decade or so. the premise does not directly provide information about future wealth trends. however, the fact that americans have lost a significant portion of their wealth in the last 30 years does not contradict the hypothesis. step 3: the hypothesis is not logically entailed by the premise because the premise only provides information about the past, and the hypothesis makes a prediction about the future. however, the premise does not rule out the possibility of further wealth loss, so the hypothesis is not contradictory either. it is important to note that making a prediction about future events based on past trends is a common reasoning strategy, but it is not a logical entailment."
4110,"Many Lakeland hotels also quote a D, B and B (dinner, bed, and breakfast) rate, which includes the evening meal and is often quite cost-effective.","The only way to stay at a Lakeland hotel is to pay for a full-day package, which includes 3 meals and is often quite expensive. ",0,0,True,"step 1: in the premise, it is mentioned that 'many lakeland hotels also quote a d, b and b (dinner, bed, and breakfast) rate'. this rate includes dinner, bed, and breakfast, which implies that these meals are provided as part of the accommodation package. step 2: the hypothesis states that 'the only way to stay at a lakeland hotel is to pay for a full-day package, which includes 3 meals and is often quite expensive'. this statement contradicts the premise, as it suggests that there is no other way to stay at a lakeland hotel besides the full-day package. however, the premise clearly states that there is another option: the d, b and b rate. step 3: based on the given information, the hypothesis cannot be logically inferred from the premise. the premise describes one of the available options for staying at a lakeland hotel, while the hypothesis incorrectly states that it is the only option."
4111,"Others (a Saint Jerome and a Virgin) are on display among the chalices and retablos of the Museo Diocesano, adjoining the Cathedral.",The Museo Dicesano was established in the 11th century.,1,0,False,"step 1. in the premise, it is stated that 'others (a saint jerome and a virgin)' are on display among the chalices and retablos of the museo diocesano. this information indicates that there are religious artifacts and possibly figures on display in the museo diocesano. it is also mentioned that this museum is located near the cathedral. no specific details about the age or establishment of the museum are provided.step 2. the hypothesis proposes that the museo dicesano was established in the 11th century. however, the premise does not provide any information about the age or establishment of the museum. the hypothesis contradicts the premise as there is no logical connection or inference that can be made from the premise to the hypothesis.step 3. based on the given information, the hypothesis cannot be logically inferred from the premise.label: 0"
4112,"When implemented well, it can be about three times faster than its main competitors, merge sort and heapsort.","When implemented well, it can be about two or three times faster than its main competitors, merge sort and heapsort.",1,1,True,"step 1: the premise states that merge sort and heapsort are the main competitors of the sorting algorithm being discussed, and that when implemented well, it is approximately three times faster than these competitors. step 2: the hypothesis suggests that when implemented well, the sorting algorithm is about two or three times faster than merge sort and heapsort. this is a reasonable assumption as the difference between being two and a half times faster and three times faster is not significant in this context and falls within the range of 'about'. step 3: based on the logical equivalence of the statements in the premise and hypothesis, the hypothesis can be inferred from the premise."
4113,"'We can't find him, Benjamin,' Lincoln/Natalia said.","After 12 hours looking for him, Lincoln/Natalia gave up.",1,1,True,"step 1: in the premise, lincoln/natalia is expressed as unable to find someone, but the identity of the person is not mentioned. the time spent looking for this person is also stated as 'we can't find him, benjamin' or 'we can't find him, natalia'. this suggests that they have been searching for a considerable amount of time.step 2: in the hypothesis, it is stated that after 12 hours, lincoln/natalia gave up. this is a reasonable assumption based on the information in the premise, as the lengthy search effort implies a certain level of frustration or exhaustion that could lead someone to give up. the hypothesis does not contradict the premise, as it does not state that they stopped searching before the 12-hour mark.step 3: given the logical connection between the premise and hypothesis, and the common-sense understanding that a prolonged search effort may result in giving up, the hypothesis can be inferred from the premise."
4114,we drive sixty five oh yes well,The vehicle was a hybrid in which we drove 65.,1,0,False,"step 1. in the premise, 'we drive sixty five', the key information is 'we drive' indicating an action and 'sixty five' as the speed at which the action is performed. there is no specific information about the type of vehicle. step 2. in the hypothesis, 'the vehicle was a hybrid in which we drove 65', the hypothesis introduces a new piece of information about the vehicle being a hybrid. while the premise does not explicitly deny or confirm this, it does not provide enough information to logically infer it. step 3. based on the given information, the hypothesis cannot be logically inferred from the premise."
4116,"The most comfortable courses are in the cooler hill stations, notably Cameron Highlands and Fraser's Hill.",The hill stations were too cold for a course.,0,0,True,"step 1: in the premise, it is stated that the most comfortable courses are in the cooler hill stations, specifically mentioning cameron highlands and fraser's hill. this implies that these hill stations have lower temperatures compared to other places. step 2: the hypothesis suggests that the hill stations were 'too cold for a course.' while the premise does not explicitly state that the temperature was ideal for the courses, it does not contradict the hypothesis either. it is logical that cooler temperatures could potentially make it difficult to conduct a course, depending on the nature of the course. step 3: based on the logical reasoning, the hypothesis 'the hill stations were too cold for a course' can be considered a possible implication of the premise, as the premise does not rule out the possibility of unfavorable conditions for the courses in the cooler hill stations."
4117,"Conservatively dressed businessmen escort impeccably coiffed women, while retired gentlemen in cardigans, jackets and ties play chess or petanca (a game resembling marbles, but played with heavy shot-puts) in the park.",The park is overrun with teenage skinhead biker gangs.,0,0,True,"step 1: in the premise, we have a description of an orderly scene in a park with businessmen escorting women and retired gentlemen playing peaceful games. this creates a context of a controlled, civilized environment. step 2: the hypothesis presents a stark contrast to the premise, describing a park overrun with teenage skinhead biker gangs. this implies chaos, violence, and a clear absence of the orderly and controlled environment described in the premise. step 3: given the significant difference between the premise and hypothesis, it is not logically possible for the hypothesis to be inferred from the premise. the hypothesis contradicts the premise and provides new information not entailed by the premise."
4118,"The church of Panagia Theoskepastos houses a fine 14th-century icon, and the Catholic Cathedral has a tenth-century Madonna and Child.",Both churches are still active today and serve large congregations.,1,0,False,"step 1: in the premise, we have two pieces of information about two different churches. the first church, panagia theoskepastos, is said to house a 14th-century icon. the second church, the catholic cathedral, is said to have a tenth-century madonna and child. none of this information implies anything about the current activity or size of the congregations. common sense and historical records suggest that many old churches remain active with substantial congregations.step 2: the hypothesis makes a statement about the current state of the churches. however, the premise does not provide enough information to logically infer this. there is no reason to assume that the information about the historical icons implies anything about the current status of the churches.step 3: based on the given information, we cannot logically infer that both churches are still active and serve large congregations."
4119,Turns out that Bill got one letter last year that just tore at his heartstrings.,Bill got more than one letter last year that made him feel loved.,1,1,True,"step 1: in the premise, it is stated that bill got one letter last year which 'tore at his heartstrings'. this implies that the letter had a profound emotional impact on bill. it does not necessarily mean that the letter was expressing love, but it could be. the premise does not contain any contradictory information that would prevent the hypothesis from being true.step 2: the hypothesis states that bill got 'more than one' letter last year which 'made him feel loved'. this is not directly contradictory to the premise, as the premise only mentions one specific letter. if we assume that the emotional impact of the one letter mentioned in the premise is an example of the 'letters that made him feel loved' mentioned in the hypothesis, then the hypothesis can be logically inferred from the premise.step 3: based on the given information and logical reasoning, it can be concluded that the hypothesis is a logical consequence of the premise, as the hypothesis does not contradict it and can be derived from it."
4120,You know better.,You understand you don't know this.,0,0,True,"step 1: the premise 'you know better' suggests a claim to expertise or knowledge in a particular domain. the hypothesis 'you understand you don't know this' implies a recognition of one's own ignorance or lack of knowledge on a subject. these statements are logically contradictory as they convey opposite states of knowledge. step 2: the hypothesis cannot be logically inferred from the premise as the premise does not provide any information that would lead to the hypothesis as a logical consequence. in fact, the hypothesis contradicts the premise. step 3: based on logical analysis, the hypothesis is not entailed by the premise."
4121,the Centralized Application Service for Physician Assistants is an application service for graduate - level PA programs.,CASPA or the Centralized Application Service for Physician Assistants is an application service for graduate-level PA programs.,1,1,True,"step 1: in the premise, it is explicitly stated that caspa is an application service for graduate-level pa programs. step 2: the hypothesis matches the premise exactly in meaning. both the premise and hypothesis describe caspa as an application service for graduate-level physician assistants. step 3: based on the direct match in meaning, the hypothesis is logically entailed by the premise."
4122,Talk straight.',Confuse the words.,0,0,True,"step 1: in the premise, 'talk straight' is an idiom that means speak honestly or clearly. it does not provide any specific information about the words being used or their order. step 2: the hypothesis, 'confuse the words', is the opposite of 'talk straight'. it implies that there is an intention or action to mix up or alter the meaning of words. step 3: the hypothesis cannot be logically inferred from the premise because the premise provides no information about words or their order, and the hypothesis introduces a new concept that contradicts the clear and honest communication implied by 'talk straight'. step 4: based on the lack of logical connection, common sense reasoning, and the contradictory nature of the hypothesis, it cannot be inferred from the premise."
4123,"In addition, testimony statements generally are not provided to agencies for comment.",Testimony statements are provided to social networks for open discussion.,1,0,False,"step 1: in the premise, it is stated that testimony statements are not typically provided to agencies for comment. this suggests a common practice where testimony statements are kept confidential and not made publicly available. step 2: the hypothesis proposes a contradictory scenario, where testimony statements are provided to social networks for open discussion. however, the hypothesis lacks sufficient logical connection or factual basis to be inferred from the premise. there is no information in the premise that implies a widespread practice of providing testimony statements to social networks. step 3: based on the given information, the hypothesis cannot be logically inferred from the premise."
4124,Both treats are expensive but delicious.,Both treats can be purchased at the small restaurant next to the hotel.,1,0,False,"step 1: in the premise, we have the information that both treats are expensive and delicious. the fact that they are expensive does not provide any direct relationship to the hypothesis. the statement that they are delicious is not relevant to the hypothesis.step 2: the hypothesis states that both treats can be purchased at the small restaurant next to the hotel. this statement does not logically follow from the premise as there is no information in the premise that suggests where the treats can be purchased.step 3: based on the given information, the hypothesis cannot be inferred from the premise as there is no logical connection or common sense reasoning that would allow us to make that assumption."
4125,The selection of pieces from Roth's large journalistic output was made by Michael Bienert and published in German in 1996.,The selection of pieces from Roth's large journalistic output was made by Michael Bienert and published in German in 1997.,0,0,True,"step 1: in the premise, we have information about the person who made the selection and the language in which the selection was published, along with the year. the hypothesis presents the same information but with a different year. step 2: the hypothesis does not contradict the premise, as both state that michael bienert made the selection and it was published in german. however, the hypothesis proposes a different year than the premise. step 3: based on the provided information, there is no logical connection or inference that can be made from the premise to the hypothesis regarding the year. the hypothesis is not logically entailed by the premise, as it introduces a new fact without any indication or implication in the premise."
4126,The words of the chant were meaningless.,People weren't chanting anything.,0,0,True,"step 1: the premise states that the words of the chant were meaningless. this suggests that the focus is on the sound of the chant rather than the meaning of the words. it does not necessarily imply that there were no words being spoken or that no communication was taking place. step 2: the hypothesis asserts that 'people weren't chanting anything.' this is a stronger claim than the premise. if people weren't chanting anything, then the words would have indeed been meaningless. however, the premise does not logically entail that no words were being spoken, only that the words lacked meaning. step 3: based on the logical analysis, the hypothesis cannot be logically inferred from the premise as it makes an additional claim beyond the information given in the premise."
4127,oh yeah we did too,"No, we did not.",0,0,True,"step 1. in the premise, 'oh yeah we did too' implies agreement or confirmation with an earlier statement. the hypothesis, 'no, we did not', directly contradicts this.step 2. based on the information provided, the hypothesis cannot be logically inferred from the premise, as they are opposing statements.step 3. given the contradictory nature of the hypothesis and premise, the hypothesis is not entailed by the premise, and they represent mutually exclusive statements."
4128,It also raises the question of what to do with people who can't take the drug because of the side effects.,Common side effects include spontaneous cranial implosion and upset stomach.,1,1,True,"step 1: in the premise, there is a question about what to do with people who cannot take a drug due to side effects. this implies that there are side effects of the drug that prevent some people from taking it. the hypothesis provides specific examples of these side effects. step 2: the hypothesis does not contradict the premise; instead, it provides additional information about the side effects mentioned in the premise. this information is consistent with the premise as it also implies that some people cannot take the drug due to these side effects. step 3: based on the logical relationship between the premise and hypothesis, and the lack of contradictory information, the hypothesis can be inferred from the premise as it provides more details about the side effects alluded to in the premise."
4129,American Movie suggests that there's no such thing as the little people in the hinterlands anymore.,American Movie suggests there isn't any thing like little people in the hinterlands anymore because it was too controversial.,1,0,False,"step 1. the premise is a statement from a movie titled 'american movie' expressing a belief that 'there's no such thing as the little people in the hinterlands anymore'. in this context, 'little people' is likely a reference to a derogatory term for people of short stature. 'hinterlands' refers to rural or remote areas. the statement implies that the filmmaker or narrator believes this group no longer exists or is not relevant to the contemporary american society.step 2. the hypothesis suggests that the reason for this belief is that the topic was 'too controversial'. it is not explicitly stated in the premise that the absence of 'little people' in the hinterlands is due to controversy. however, the hypothesis does not contradict the premise since the premise does not rule out the possibility that controversy could be a factor.step 3. while the hypothesis does not directly follow from the premise, the two statements are related as they both discuss the perception of 'little people' in the hinterlands. the hypothesis introduces a new piece of information - the potential controversial nature of the topic. however, the premise does not necessitate this conclusion, and the hypothesis does not logically follow from the premise alone. therefore, the hypothesis is not entailed by the premise.step 4. it is important to note that making assumptions about the motivations or reasons behind someone's beliefs based on limited information can be misleading. the hypothesis may be true, but without further context, it cannot be logically inferred from the premise alone."
4130,A stopover in Singapore is also an opportunity to find the latest bargains for cameras and computers.,Singapore is the best country for buying cameras and computers.,1,0,False,"step 1: in the premise, it is mentioned that singapore is a place where one can find the latest bargains for cameras and computers. this implies that singapore has a high concentration of electronic stores or markets that offer competitive prices. step 2: the hypothesis, 'singapore is the best country for buying cameras and computers,' goes beyond what is stated in the premise as it asserts that singapore is the absolute best. however, the premise does suggest that singapore is a prime location for purchasing these items due to the availability of bargains. step 3: while the hypothesis cannot be logically inferred directly from the premise because the premise does not make a definitive statement about singapore being the best country, it does provide some evidence that supports the hypothesis. common sense and additional context could also be considered to strengthen the argument. for instance, if singapore has a reputation for having the lowest prices or the widest selection of electronic goods, then the hypothesis could be more plausible. however, without such additional information, the premise alone does not entail the hypothesis."
4131,"  overall characteristics of the acquisition including its objectives shown within the context of the mission(s) or function(s) to be supported,",The regulations require the acquisition be supported by complete documentation concerning goals.,1,0,False,"step 1: in the premise, the acquisition's objectives and their context within the mission(s) or function(s) are mentioned. however, there is no explicit statement about documentation requirements. step 2: the hypothesis suggests that regulations necessitate complete documentation for the acquisition. this is a possible implication of the premise if it is a common requirement for acquisitions in the given context. step 3: while the premise does not directly entail the hypothesis, if 'completeness of documentation' is a typical or required aspect of acquisitions in the context described, then the hypothesis can be logically inferred from the premise. however, more context is needed to make this definitive conclusion. step 4: based on the given information, it is not possible to determine with certainty whether the hypothesis is entailed by the premise, as the premise does not explicitly state the documentation requirement, but if such a requirement is a common practice in the context described, then it can be inferred."
4132,There's a disconnect between lawyers and the people who need their services.,The lawyers don't understand why their customers can't get help.,1,0,False,"step 1: in the premise, there is a stated issue of disconnect between lawyers and the people who need their services. this disconnect implies a gap in communication or understanding. step 2: the hypothesis suggests that the lawyers may not understand why their clients are having difficulty accessing their services. this lack of understanding could potentially contribute to the disconnect mentioned in the premise. step 3: while the premise and hypothesis do not directly logically entail each other, there is a potential for the hypothesis to be a reasonable inference based on the information provided. the hypothesis does not contradict the premise and could plausibly explain the disconnect described."
4133,Providing delegated authorities can enable employees to control their own work processes and schedules.,No employees can control their own work processes and schedules.,0,0,True,"step 1: in the premise, it is stated that providing delegated authorities can help employees control their own work processes and schedules. this implies that under normal circumstances, and with the appropriate authority and resources, employees can exercise control over their tasks and schedules. step 2: the hypothesis, on the contrary, asserts that no employees can control their own work processes and schedules. this statement directly contradicts the information provided in the premise. step 3: based on this analysis, the hypothesis cannot be logically inferred from the premise, as it contradicts the stated information."
4134,"There is a good restaurant in the village, in addition to a well-stocked mini-market for self-catering visitors.",The village has nowhere to dine.,0,0,True,"step 1: in the premise, there is a statement about a good restaurant existing in the village. this means that the village has at least one place to dine. step 2: the hypothesis states that the village has 'nowhere to dine'. this directly contradicts the information given in the premise. step 3: based on the logical negation of the premise in the hypothesis, it is clear that the hypothesis cannot be inferred from the premise. instead, the hypothesis contradicts the premise.step 4: a contradiction between two statements cannot lead to a logical entailment, so the hypothesis is not entailed by the premise."
4135,yeah that's what i'm actually told i've i've never experienced a hurricane,I haven't lived anywhere that hurricane's are common. ,1,1,True,"step 1: in the premise, the speaker is stating that they have never experienced a hurricane and have only been told about it. this implies that they have not resided in an area where hurricanes are a common occurrence. in the hypothesis, it is stated that the speaker hasn't lived anywhere that hurricane's are common. the premise and hypothesis share the same essential meaning.step 2: the hypothesis is a more general statement than the premise, as it refers to any place where hurricanes are common, not just the specific places the speaker has lived. however, since the speaker's lack of experience with hurricanes directly implies that they haven't lived in such areas, the hypothesis can be logically inferred from the premise.step 3: based on the logical connection between the premise and hypothesis, the hypothesis can be considered a logical entailment of the premise."
4136,oh yeah it's really worth it i mean it's a very good movie and yes i would suggest seeing it at the theater i know that they're still playing it and they pushed it back to playing it in the theaters until like August,"Unfortunately, they're no longer playing it in theaters.",0,0,True,"step 1. in the premise, the speaker expresses their opinion that the movie is good and worth seeing at the theater, mentioning that it's still being played there until august. step 2. the hypothesis states that they're no longer playing it in theaters. this directly contradicts the premise, as the premise indicates that the movie is still being played in theaters when the speaker suggests seeing it. step 3. based on the contradiction between the two statements, the hypothesis cannot be logically inferred from the premise.step 4. it's important to note that logical inference is based on the given information, and any assumptions not explicitly stated in the premise or hypothesis are not considered. in this case, the hypothesis includes new information that contradicts the premise, making it impossible to infer the hypothesis from the premise."
4137,yeah i just wish it was a little more convenient convenient to do you know,I'm so glad that it is very easy to do.,0,0,True,"step 1: in the premise, the speaker expresses a wish that it was more convenient for them to do something. conveying a wish implies acknowledging that there is currently an inconvenience. in the hypothesis, the speaker expresses satisfaction with something being easy. these statements do not directly contradict each other, as the hypothesis can be interpreted as a positive response to the inconvenience mentioned in the premise.step 2: the hypothesis does not logically follow from the premise because the premise does not provide enough information to infer that the speaker's satisfaction with ease directly relates to the initial inconvenience. it is possible that the speaker is referring to a different situation or task in the hypothesis.step 3: based on the given information, the hypothesis is not logically entailed by the premise. there is no clear logical connection between the two statements."
4138,He and his party are charged with forging a positive path for the people of Jamaica.,The people of Jamaica supported him and his party.,1,1,True,"step 1: in the premise, it is stated that 'he and his party are charged with forging a positive path for the people of jamaica'. this implies that their goal is to improve the lives or well-being of the people. step 2: the hypothesis, 'the people of jamaica supported him and his party', does not directly contradict the premise. in fact, it is a likely outcome of their actions. if the people of jamaica saw that his actions were beneficial to them, they would be more likely to support him and his party. step 3: based on the logical connection between the actions described in the premise and the potential outcome of support from the people, and the common sense understanding that people often support those who work to improve their lives, the hypothesis can be inferred from the premise.step 4: it is important to note that while the hypothesis can be logically inferred from the premise, it does not necessarily mean that it is true in reality. the premise only describes their charge, and it does not provide any information about whether or not the people of jamaica actually did support him and his party."
4139,"Other Crusades followed, but the knights never recovered their earlier territories, and by the end of the 13th century were faced with a new enemy.","The knights eventually reclaimed all of the territory they had lost, and more.",0,0,True,"step 1: in the premise, it is stated that the knights never recovered their earlier territories by the end of the 13th century. this implies that they had lost significant territories during the crusades. no information is provided about any territorial gains after the 13th century. step 2: the hypothesis suggests that the knights not only reclaimed all of their lost territories but gained more. this is in direct contradiction to the premise since the premise asserts that they did not recover all their territories by the end of the 13th century. step 3: based on the logical analysis, the hypothesis is not entailed by the premise."
4140,"After reaching this long-run equilibrium, increased saving and investment yields a higher level of GDP per capita but does not boost worker productivity and economic growth.",Worker productivity and economic growth go hand in hand with higher yields of GDP.,0,0,True,"step 1: in the premise, it is stated that increased saving and investment leads to a higher level of gdp per capita, but it does not result in a boost to worker productivity and economic growth. this suggests that there is a decoupling between gdp per capita and worker productivity. however, the premise does not dispute the general relationship between productivity and economic growth. step 2: the hypothesis proposes a direct relationship between worker productivity and economic growth. this can be seen as a common sense assumption, as increased productivity often leads to economic growth. however, the premise does not explicitly deny this relationship, but rather states that it is not directly linked to increased yields of gdp. step 3: the hypothesis is not logically inferred from the premise, as the premise does not entail the hypothesis. the premise only indicates that there is no direct relationship between increased yields of gdp and productivity or economic growth. the hypothesis proposes a direct relationship between productivity and economic growth. therefore, the hypothesis cannot be logically inferred from the premise."
4141,no they don't take any i mean i couldn't even go there my husband couldn't we would have to receive all this special permission to go there for even when some you know in in inner company you know transfer or something and i have another friend from uh Costa Rica that she was born there she's Costa Rican i guess i do know a little bit i went to Mexico City one time and stayed i've been there twice and stayed and that was that was just really sad but a lot of it though is their debt i think that we should not loan them anymore money that if we still want to give them money give them money quit loaning it to them you're not going to get it back don't be indebted to anybody don't be the you know loaner nor borrower and it's just not good we need to if we feel like we need to give them money then give it to them but quit loaning all the money out which i don't think we're loaning anymore now but that's how we got into a problem if we got them we have sink them in the hole by us loaning them all of these billions of dollars that common sense you could just look at it and say they're not going to be able to pay us back,He will not go to the church in Guatemala.,0,0,True,"step 1. the premise discusses the speaker's experiences with visiting mexico and costa rica, her thoughts on loans to these countries, and her belief that these countries cannot pay back their debts. there is no direct mention or implication of guatemala or attending a church in guatemala. step 2. the hypothesis asserts that someone (not identified) will not go to a church in guatemala. the premise does not provide any information that logically leads to this conclusion, nor is it a necessary implication of the premise. step 3. based on the given information, the hypothesis 'he will not go to the church in guatemala' cannot be logically inferred from the premise."
4142,yeah oh and still are,Not anymore. ,0,0,True,"step 1: analyzing the given premise 'yeah oh and still are', it is vague and doesn't provide clear information about any specific subjects or their states. it could be interpreted as an affirmation or agreement about something that is ongoing.step 2: the hypothesis 'not anymore' contradicts the premise if we interpret 'yeah oh and still are' as an affirmation or agreement. however, without more context or specific subjects, it's hard to definitively determine if the hypothesis can be logically inferred from the premise.step 3: based on the given information, it's not possible to determine with certainty if the hypothesis 'not anymore' is entailed by the premise 'yeah oh and still are'. the lack of clear subject-verb agreement and context in the premise makes it difficult to make a logical inference."
4143,"In other words, we're not producing 30 percent more, but more of what we do produce goes to corporate profits and less to wages?",We spend $4million less on wages than 10 years ago.,1,0,False,"step 1: the premise indicates that there has been a shift in the distribution of resources between corporate profits and wages, with more going to profits and less to wages. this information does not directly provide specific numbers about the wages or the change in wages over the past 10 years.step 2: the hypothesis proposes a quantifiable change in wages, stating that $4million less is spent on wages compared to 10 years ago. this is not a logical direct inference from the premise, as the premise does not provide the necessary specific wage data.step 3: based on the given information, the hypothesis cannot be logically inferred from the premise."
4144,"Something in his mind seemed also to have developed a ""tan"" that let him face the bite of chance without flinching.",Despite all his experiences he still flinched at the prospect of chance.,0,0,True,"step 1: in the premise, the subject 'something in his mind' developed a mental resilience described as a 'tan' that allows him to face the 'bite of chance' without flinching. this implies that the subject has become accustomed to dealing with uncertain situations and can handle them with composure.step 2: the hypothesis states that 'despite all his experiences he still flinched at the prospect of chance.' this contradicts the premise, as the premise indicates that the subject no longer flinches at the prospect of chance.step 3: based on the given information, the hypothesis cannot be logically inferred from the premise."
4145, You Keep Me Hangin ' On  is a 1966 song composed by Holland – Dozier – Holland.,You Keep Me Hangin' On is a 1966 song written and composed by Holland–Dozier–Holland.,1,1,True,"step 1. both the premise and hypothesis describe the same song, 'you keep me hangin' on', and provide the same composers, holland–dozer–holland. the information in the premise and hypothesis is identical in this regard.step 2. since the composer information in the hypothesis is the same as that in the premise, the hypothesis can be logically inferred from the premise. in other words, if the premise is true, then the hypothesis must also be true because it is simply stating the same fact.step 3. based on the logical identity of the information in the premise and hypothesis, the hypothesis can be considered to be entailed by the premise."
4146,"'Hello.' It wasn't the strongest start in the world, but it was a classic.",Everyone says 'hello' since it is a classic way to start.,1,1,True,"step 1: in the premise, 'hello.' is described as a classic way to start. this implies that 'hello' is a common greeting, widely used in social situations. step 2: the hypothesis suggests that 'everyone says hello' because it is a classic way to start. this directly follows from the information provided in the premise. step 3: based on the logical connection between the premise and hypothesis, and the common sense understanding that 'hello' is indeed a classic way to start a conversation, the hypothesis can be inferred from the premise."
4147,Its major interest is in the seven statues by Michelangelo.,"Its main interest is in the statues made by Michelangelo, including David.",1,1,True,"step 1: in the premise, 'its major interest' refers to a specific subject's primary focus or fascination. the seven statues by michelangelo are identified as the object of this interest. step 2: the hypothesis also refers to 'its main interest' but uses the term 'main' instead of 'major'. although there might be a slight difference in emphasis between 'major' and 'main', in this context, they convey similar meanings. the hypothesis, however, adds the specification 'including david'. step 3: the hypothesis can be logically inferred from the premise because the seven statues by michelangelo include the statue of david. therefore, an interest in the seven statues logically implies an interest in david as one of those statues. step 4: logically, the hypothesis is entailed by the premise."
4148,Two people sit on a bench leaned against a building with writing on it.,Tow people are resting their backs against a bench.,1,1,True,"step 1: in the premise, two people are sitting on a bench that is leaned against a building. the key information here is that the bench is in contact with the building. step 2: the hypothesis suggests that the two people are resting their backs against the bench. this is a reasonable inference because typically, when a bench is leaned against a building, people sit on it with their backs facing the building for support and comfort. this is a common resting position. step 3: based on the logical reasoning and common sense, the hypothesis can be inferred from the premise."
4149,and i still live in the same area it's it's built up somewhat and crime really hasn't been a problem it's been uh uh mostly outsiders coming in and you know robbing or breaking into automobiles and stealing uh,Crime hasn't been a problem,1,1,True,"step 1. in the premise, the speaker states that they live in an area where crime hasn't been a problem for them personally. the speaker also mentions that the crime issues have been caused mostly by outsiders. step 2. the hypothesis is that 'crime hasn't been a problem', which is the same as the premise. therefore, the hypothesis can be logically inferred from the premise since it is an identical statement. step 3. since the hypothesis is an exact repetition of the premise, it is entailed by the premise."
4150,i understand i was around somebody today outdoors and they're smoking and it's like you know i smell it and i'm like well is this going into my bloodstream you know is this is there going to be enough there to get me,I was outside and someone was smoking but I didn't smell it.,0,0,True,"step 1: in the premise, the speaker states that they were outside and someone was smoking, and they detected the smell. this implies that the smoking occurred in close proximity to the speaker. step 2: the hypothesis suggests that the speaker did not detect the smell of smoking. this contradicts the information given in the premise, as the premise states that the speaker did indeed smell the smoke. step 3: based on the information in the premise, the hypothesis 'i was outside and someone was smoking but i didn't smell it' cannot be logically inferred, as the premise and hypothesis are contradictory.step 4: the hypothesis is not entailed by the premise, as the premise includes the detail that the speaker smelled the smoke, which is not mentioned in the hypothesis."
4151,uh-huh and is it true i mean is it um,It is absolutely correct.,1,0,False,"step 1: in this case, both the premise and hypothesis are declarative statements expressing truth. there's no clear relationship between them based on the given information. step 2: the hypothesis 'it is absolutely correct' can be logically inferred from the premise 'uh-huh and is it um' if we consider 'uh-huh' as an affirmative response and 'is it um' as a question seeking confirmation. in this context, 'is it um' can be interpreted as 'is what i'm about to say correct?'. the speaker's affirmative response 'uh-huh' implies agreement, which is similar to the meaning of 'it is absolutely correct' in the hypothesis. however, this inference relies on the assumption that the speaker's affirmation refers to the premise or the following statement. step 3: although the hypothesis can be inferred based on this assumption, it's essential to note that the hypothesis is a stronger claim than the premise. using 'absolutely correct' implies that there are no exceptions or contradictions, which might not be the case for the premise. therefore, the hypothesis is not strictly entailed by the premise, but it can be a reasonable inference given the provided context."
4153,The new Monica sounded sweetly  She told a friend it breaks my heart to testify and said all she wanted for her 25 th birthday was my life back.,Monica was wearing a dark blue shirt with blue jeans.,1,0,False,"step 1: in the premise, monica is described as sounding sweetly and sharing her feelings about testingify and wanting her life back for her 25th birthday. there is no mention of what monica was wearing at the time of this conversation.step 2: the hypothesis, about monica wearing a dark blue shirt with blue jeans, is not logically related to the premise, as it does not follow from the information provided. there is no commonsense connection or factual consistency between monica's appearance and her words.step 3: based on the given information, there is no entailment between the premise and the hypothesis."
4154,Your cousin?,That person looks similar to you.,1,1,True,"step 1: in the premise, 'your cousin' is mentioned. 'your cousin' is a person related to you by blood. step 2: the hypothesis states that 'that person looks similar to you'. this is a logical consequence of the premise, as it is a common observation that family members share physical resemblances. therefore, the hypothesis can be inferred from the premise based on logical and commonsense reasoning. step 3: given the logical connection and factual consistency between the premise and hypothesis, the hypothesis is entailed by the premise."
4155,UTC is was adopted in 1972.,"UTC is calculated by reference to atomic clocks, and was adopted in 1972.",1,1,True,"step 1: in the premise, utc (coordinated universal time) is mentioned as being adopted in the year 1972. utc is the primary time standard used in civil aviation, telecommunications, and meteorology. it is based on international atomic time (tai), with leap seconds being added at irregular intervals to keep utc aligned with the earth's rotation. step 2: the hypothesis states that utc is calculated by reference to atomic clcks and was adopted in 1972. the first part of the hypothesis is already known from the premise, as utc is indeed calculated using atomic clocks. the second part is consistent with the information in the premise since the adoption of utc in 1972 is the same in both statements. step 3: given that the hypothesis is logically equivalent to the premise for the first part, and the second part is a known fact that is consistent with the premise, the hypothesis is entailed by the premise.step 3: based on the logical reasoning and the factual consistency, the hypothesis is inferred from the premise."
4156,"One unexpected sight, in a remote valley near Cala Llonga, is a civilized, meticulously tended, exquisitely green golf course.","The golf course is not well known, so not a lot of people use it.",1,0,False,"step 1: the premise describes a golf course as unexpected, civilized, meticulously tended, and exquisitely green, located in a remote valley near cala llonga. no information is given about the popularity or usage of the golf course. step 2: the hypothesis makes an assertion about the golf course being not well known and, consequently, not having a lot of people use it. this information is not explicitly stated in the premise. however, the premise's description of the golf course as 'unexpected' suggests that it might not be well-known or heavily used. however, this is an assumption and not a direct logical inference from the premise. step 3: based on the given information, the hypothesis cannot be definitively proven or disproven as it goes beyond what is stated in the premise. the premise only describes the golf course's characteristics; it does not provide any information about its usage or popularity."
4158,He must parry opponents' attacks better.,He didn't need to parry his opponents' attacks.,0,0,True,step 1: the premise implies that the person needs to improve his ability to defend against attacks. this is stated in the conditional form 'must' and the verb 'parry'. step 2: the hypothesis contradicts the premise as it suggests that the person didn't need to parry his opponents' attacks. step 3: the hypothesis cannot be logically inferred from the premise as it goes against the stated requirement for the person to improve his parrying skills.
4159,"In the case of carbon, the bank would last another two years at the rate of drawdown in 2015, or longer if the drawdown declined.","Unaffected by carbon, the bank closed immediately.",0,0,True,"step 1: in the premise, it is stated that the bank would last another two years at the rate of drawdown in 2015, or longer if the drawdown declined. this implies that the bank's longevity depends on the rate of carbon drawdown. it also suggests that the bank would continue to exist for some time if the drawdown rate decreased. step 2: the hypothesis states that the bank closed immediately, unaffected by carbon. this directly contradicts the premise, as the premise indicates that the bank would continue to exist for some time, while the hypothesis states it closed immediately. step 3: based on the logical contradiction between the premise and hypothesis, the hypothesis cannot be inferred from the premise.step 3: the hypothesis states that the bank closed immediately, while the premise states that the bank would continue to exist for some time. these statements are contradictory, making the hypothesis not entailed by the premise."
4160,i'd like to have a volunteer come here and rake leaves and  mow the grass and,I'd hate for anyone to touch this law but agricultural experts.,0,0,True,"step 1. the premise describes a situation where the speaker is requesting someone to perform certain tasks: raking leaves and mowing the grass. this is a common request for maintaining a property. the hypothesis also describes a situation where someone is present and interacting with the speaker's property, but in the negative form: 'i'd hate for anyone to touch this law'. 'touch' is a vague term that can refer to physical contact, but the context suggests a figurative meaning, possibly referring to making changes or interfering with the speaker's plans.step 2. the hypothesis does not follow logically from the premise. the premise describes a desire for volunteer labor, while the hypothesis expresses a negative sentiment towards anyone touching the speaker's property. there is no logical connection between the two.step 3. based on the lack of logical connection and the different meanings of 'touch' in the two sentences, the hypothesis cannot be inferred from the premise."
4161,and uh i have a few health food stores that i send it to i can buy the cookies in a larger quantity than they can so i can get a deal from the uh from the main from the supplier,I send it to the health food stores once a month to get an order of the cookies.,1,1,True,"step 1: in the premise, the speaker mentions having health food stores that they send larger quantities of cookies to, allowing them to get a better deal from the supplier. this implies a regular buying pattern, as they are able to make larger orders. however, the premise does not explicitly state how often this occurs. step 2: the hypothesis suggests that the speaker sends the orders to the health food stores once a month. this is a reasonable assumption based on the information in the premise, as it suggests a regular buying pattern. it is also a common practice for businesses to place larger orders less frequently to save on costs and reduce inventory. step 3: based on the logical reasoning, the hypothesis can be inferred from the premise as it is a reasonable assumption given the information provided."
4162,yes it is seems very high it hasn't bothered me but i know the people that have allergies it seems to be a pretty high,"I know several people who are suffering from allergies so badly, that they have to take medication.",1,0,False,"step 1. in the premise, the speaker mentions that they are at a high altitude and it hasn't bothered them, but acknowledges that some people have allergies that can be worsened by high places. this implies that the speaker is currently in a high place and recognizes the potential for allergic reactions to occur. the hypothesis states that several people are suffering from allergies so badly that they require medication.step 2. the hypothesis does not logically follow from the premise as the premise does not provide enough information to deduce that several people are currently experiencing severe allergic reactions requiring medication at the high altitude. however, it is a common occurrence for people with allergies to be negatively affected by high places, and the speaker acknowledges this fact. therefore, the hypothesis is a reasonable assumption based on common sense and the information provided.step 3. based on the given information and common sense reasoning, the hypothesis is a reasonable assumption but it cannot be logically inferred from the premise."
4163,"Raves for this London import, directed by Howard Davies and starring Kevin Spacey.",It is directed by Kevin Spacey. ,0,0,True,"step 1: in the premise, the sentence 'directed by howard davies' identifies the name of the film's director. the sentence 'starring kevin spacey' identifies the name of the film's leading actor. step 2: the hypothesis 'it is directed by kevin spacey' is a direct contradiction to the premise. the hypothesis asserts that kevin spacey is the director, not the actor. step 3: based on the logical relationship between the premise and hypothesis, there is no entailment. the hypothesis cannot be logically inferred from the premise."
4164,"Situated due east of Mysore, Srirangapatnam was the site of the battles against the Muslim ruler Tipu Sultan in the 1790s, in which the British gained control of the peninsula.",Srirangapatnam was controlled by the British for over 100 years.  ,1,0,False,"step 1: the premise establishes that srirangapatnam was the site of battles between tipu sultan and the british in the late 1700s, resulting in british control. no specific time frame for the british control is mentioned in the premise, but it implies that the british gained control of srirangapatnam during that time. step 2: the hypothesis asserts that the british controlled srirangapatnam for over 100 years. this duration is longer than the period mentioned in the premise, but it is not explicitly stated that the british control ended during that time. however, there is no information provided in the premise that would contradict the hypothesis. step 3: based on the given information, the hypothesis can be considered plausible, as there is no direct contradiction to it in the premise. however, the premise does not logically entail the hypothesis, as the premise only implies that the british controlled srirangapatnam for a period of time, without specifying its exact length. therefore, the hypothesis cannot be logically inferred from the premise, but it is consistent with it."
4165,This rule would also require public utilities to implement standards of conduct to functionally separate transmission and wholesale power merchant functions.,The public utilities were trying to fight the regulations.,1,0,False,"step 1: in the premise, a rule is stated that would require public utilities to functionally separate their transmission and wholesale power merchant functions. this rule implies that there are regulations being imposed on public utilities. step 2: the hypothesis suggests that public utilities were trying to resist or fight these regulations. this hypothesis is not a direct logical entailment of the premise, but it is a plausible inference based on the context. the premise indicates a change or requirement that the public utilities must adapt to, which is a common reason for resistance or opposition. step 3: while the hypothesis cannot be logically deduced from the premise alone, it is a reasonable and common-sense inference given the context. the premise provides sufficient context for the hypothesis to be plausible.step 4: in some cases, common sense or background knowledge can provide additional context to support an inference. for instance, it is common knowledge that regulations often meet resistance or opposition from those they are imposed upon, particularly if the regulations involve significant changes or costs. this common sense knowledge, combined with the information in the premise, makes the hypothesis a reasonable inference.therefore, while the hypothesis is not a logical entailment of the premise, it is a reasonable and plausible inference based on the given context and common sense understanding."
4166,And a bizarre photo essay depicts a husband and wife who have worn matching outfits every day for the last 17 years.,It was the husband's idea for the couple to wear matching outfits.,1,0,False,"step 1: in the premise, it is mentioned that a husband and wife have worn matching outfits every day for the last 17 years. this implies a commitment and agreement between the couple to dress alike. however, the premise does not specify who came up with the idea. step 2: the hypothesis, 'it was the husband's idea for the couple to wear matching outfits', is not directly inferred from the premise as there is no conclusive evidence presented in the premise to support this claim. it is possible, but not logically necessary, that the wife suggested or agreed to this idea. step 3: based on the information given, it is not possible to determine if the hypothesis is entailed by the premise or not. the hypothesis makes an additional assumption that is not supported by the given information."
4167,Very little is known of Imhotep as a historical figure.,"Very little is known of Imhotep as a historical figure, but in the 3000 years following his death, he was gradually glorified and deified.",1,0,False,"step 1: the premise states that 'very little is known of imhotep as a historical figure'. this means that there is a lack of information or evidence about imhotep's life and actions. step 2: the hypothesis does not contradict the premise but adds additional information about imhotep's deification in the centuries following his death. this is not a logical contradiction, as the hypothesis can coexist with the premise. step 3: however, the hypothesis does not logically follow from the premise, as the premise does not provide any information about imhotep's post-death glorification or deification. the hypothesis is not entailed by the premise, but rather an additional fact or assumption."
4168,he did great,He did not impress me.,0,0,True,"step 1: in the premise, 'he did great', there is a positive evaluation of someone's performance or achievement. this statement is subjective and open to interpretation, as 'doing great' can mean different things to different people. step 2: the hypothesis, 'he did not impress me', implies a negative evaluation or no impression at all. this statement is also subjective and contradicts the premise's positive evaluation. step 3: based on the lack of logical connection and the contradictory nature of the hypothesis to the premise, the hypothesis cannot be inferred from the premise.step 4: it's important to note that subjective statements can be challenging to reason about logically because they depend on individual perspectives and experiences. this example highlights the importance of clear communication and context when making logical inferences."
4169,He was standing in front of a grey backdrop- somewhere that could be anywhere.,It was obvious where he was at.,0,0,True,"step 1: in the premise, the person is described as standing in front of a grey backdrop, which is neutral and non-descriptive, suggesting a lack of specific location. step 2: the hypothesis asserts that it was 'obvious' where he was at, but the premise itself does not provide any clear indication of a specific location. common sense and logical reasoning suggest that 'obvious' would imply easily recognizable or identifiable features, which are missing in the premise. step 3: based on the information provided, the hypothesis cannot be logically inferred from the premise as there is no clear connection or indication of a specific location in the premise."
4170,5 The share of gross national saving used to replace depreciated capital has increased over the past 40 years.,Depreciated capital does not need to be replaced.,0,0,True,"step 1: in the premise, it is stated that the share of gross national saving used to replace depreciated capital has increased over the past 40 years. this implies that there is a recognition of the need to replace depreciated capital. replacing depreciated capital is necessary to maintain a functional economy, and the increase in the share of savings allocated to this purpose indicates a greater commitment to this necessity. step 2: the hypothesis, however, directly contradicts the premise by suggesting that depreciated capital does not need to be replaced. this is illogical because the need to replace depreciated capital is a fundamental aspect of economic growth and maintenance. step 3: based on the logical inconsistency between the premise and hypothesis, it is clear that the hypothesis cannot be logically inferred from the premise."
4171,This theory is a little hazy about lobsters.,This theory is a little hazy about alligators.,0,0,True,"step 1: in the premise, 'this theory' is referred to as being 'a little hazy' about 'lobsters'. this implies that there are unclear or vague aspects of the theory regarding lobsters. step 2: the hypothesis states that 'this theory' is 'a little hazy' about 'alligators'. this is similar to the premise, as both suggest that there are unclear or vague aspects of the theory for different animals. step 3: while the premise and hypothesis share similarities, they do not logically follow from each other. a theory being unclear about one animal does not necessarily mean it is unclear about all animals. the hypothesis, while related, is not a logical entailment of the premise. step 4: therefore, based on logical reasoning and the given information, the hypothesis is not entailed by the premise."
4172,"There are, however, many bus tours to outlying destinations.",Bus tours always include a prepared lunch.,1,0,False,"step 1: in the premise, 'many bus tours to outlying destinations' are mentioned. this does not provide any direct information about what is included in these bus tours, such as a prepared lunch. common sense suggests that bus tours can offer various amenities, including meals, but this is not necessarily indicated in the premise. no contradictory facts are present.step 2: the hypothesis, 'bus tours always include a prepared lunch', is a stronger claim than what is stated in the premise. it is not logically entailed, as the premise does not guarantee that all bus tours include a prepared lunch.step 3: based on the given information and logical principles, the hypothesis cannot be logically inferred from the premise."
4173,Consequently the rule does not impose unfunded mandates under the Unfunded Mandates Reform Act of 1995.,THe mandates have been consistent for decades.,0,1,False,"step 1: in the premise, it is stated that the rule does not impose unfunded mandates under the unfunded mandates reform act of 1995. unfunded mandates refer to requirements imposed by the federal government on state, local, or tribal governments that lack the funding necessary to implement these requirements. the absence of unfunded mandates in the rule suggests financial consistency and predictability.step 2: the hypothesis posits that the mandates have been consistent for decades. consistency in mandates implies a stable and predictable regulatory environment. given that the rule itself is consistent and has not imposed unfunded mandates for decades, it is reasonable to infer that the mandates themselves have also been consistent.step 3: based on the logical reasoning, the consistency of the mandates for decades can be inferred from the premise, as the premise implies the financial stability and predictability necessary for such a conclusion."
4174,"The painted blue arabesques in the domes and upper walls are restorations; to see the original version, look at the wall beneath the sultan's loge.",The restored arabesques were painted the same shade of blue as the originals.,1,1,True,"step 1: the premise states that the blue arabesques in the domes and upper walls are restorations, and it provides a location to see the original version. this implies that there were originally blue arabesques, and the current restorations have been painted the same shade of blue for some reason. step 2: the hypothesis suggests that the restored arabesques were painted the same shade of blue as the originals. this is a reasonable assumption as restoration projects often aim to preserve the original appearance as closely as possible. step 3: based on the given information, the hypothesis can be inferred from the premise as it aligns with the common practice in restoration projects and the premise itself implies that the original arabesques were blue."
4176,oh it's fun jazzercise is really fun,Jazzercise is fun and a good way to lose weight.,1,1,True,"step 1: in the premise, the speaker expresses that 'jazzercise is really fun.' this statement implies that the person enjoys participating in jazzercise. step 2: the hypothesis also states that 'jazzercise is fun.' this is identical to the premise, so the hypothesis is entailed by the premise. additionally, the hypothesis adds the statement 'and a good way to lose weight.' step 3: while there's no direct contradiction between the hypothesis and the premise, the hypothesis goes beyond the information provided in the premise by making an additional claim. however, this claim is consistent with common knowledge that jazzercise can be an effective way to lose weight due to its combination of aerobic and resistance exercises. step 4: based on the logical reasoning, the identity of information between the premise and hypothesis, and the common-sense understanding that jazzercise can be effective for weight loss, the hypothesis is a logical extension of the premise.step 5: overall, the hypothesis is entailed by the premise because it logically follows from the information given in the premise and is consistent with common knowledge."
4177,A shirtless man is singing into a microphone while a woman next to him plays an accordion.,He is playing a saxophone.,0,0,True,"step 1: the premise describes a scene where a man, who is not wearing a shirt, is singing into a microphone, and a woman is playing an accordion. this information does not necessarily imply any logical connection between the man's instrument and his attire or the woman's instrument. common sense suggests that both the man's singing and the woman's accordion playing are plausible actions in various musical contexts.step 2: the hypothesis claims that the man is playing a saxophone instead of singing. however, the premise does not provide any evidence or indication that the man is playing a saxophone. therefore, the hypothesis cannot be logically inferred from the premise as there is no connection between the man's actions described in the premise and the hypothesis.step 3: based on the given information, the hypothesis 'he is playing a saxophone' is not entailed by the premise 'a shirtless man is singing into a microphone while a woman next to him plays an accordion'."
4178,"The house has beautiful views of Lake Windermere, which must have brought the poet great pleasure in his later years.",The poet died at the age of 20 years when he was still living with his parents.,0,0,True,"step 1: in the premise, it is mentioned that the house has beautiful views of lake windermere, and this detail is attributed to bringing 'great pleasure' to the poet in his later years. this suggests that the poet had a strong connection to the lake and enjoyed living near it. there is no contradictory information provided about the poet's age or living situation.step 2: the hypothesis states that the poet died at the age of 20. this information is not mentioned or implied in the premise. the hypothesis, therefore, contradicts the information provided in the premise.step 3: based on the logical reasoning and the contradictory nature of the hypothesis, it cannot be inferred from the premise."
4179,"His body was dressed in shabby clothes, and the face disfigured to prevent identification.",He was a poor man since he had bad clothes,1,1,True,"step 1: in the premise, it is mentioned that 'his body was dressed in shabby clothes' which indicates that the person was wearing old, worn-out clothes. this information can be inferred to suggest that the person is likely to be economically disadvantaged or poor. step 2: the hypothesis, 'he was a poor man,' directly follows from the premise as the premise establishes that the person's appearance indicates poverty. step 3: based on the logical connection between the premise and hypothesis, and the lack of contradictory information, the hypothesis can be inferred from the premise."
4180,but uh that Jimmy Johnson came in too though and he just you know when he bought the team and all and it just seemed like he just decided you know this is the way it's going to be and it was bad,"When Jimmy Johnson came in and bought the team, they started doing a lot better.",0,0,True,"step 1. the premise describes jimmy johnson buying the team and the negative impact it had on the team's performance. the relationship between jimmy johnson's arrival and the team's performance is described as 'bad'. step 2. the hypothesis suggests an opposite relationship between jimmy johnson's arrival and the team's performance. this means that the hypothesis contradicts the premise. step 3. based on the provided information, the hypothesis 'when jimmy johnson came in and bought the team, they started doing a lot better' cannot be logically inferred from the premise 'but uh that jimmy johnson came in too though and he just you know when he bought the team and all and it just seemed like he just decided you know this is the way it's going to be and it was bad'. in fact, the hypothesis contradicts the premise and cannot be reasonably inferred from it."
4181,Who does your transcribing?,Who does your dishes?,0,0,True,"step 1. in the premise, the subject is 'who' does the transcribing. this question indicates a person or entity responsible for performing the action of transcribing. in the hypothesis, the subject is also 'who' does an action, but this time it's 'who' does the dishes. the two 'who' questions are asking for different pieces of information.step 2. the hypothesis cannot be logically inferred from the premise as there is no connection between the actions of transcribing and doing dishes. the premise does not provide any information about dishes or the person doing them.step 3. based on the lack of logical connection and the fact that the hypothesis asks about a different action, it cannot be inferred from the premise."
4182,well no see i'm from a town named Panhandle,Panhandle is a town in Florida.,1,0,False,"step 1: in the premise, the speaker identifies themselves as being from a town named panhandle. step 2: the hypothesis proposes that panhandle is a town located in florida. however, the premise itself does not provide any information about the location of panhandle, specifically whether it is in florida or not. step 3: based on the given information, the hypothesis cannot be logically inferred from the premise as there is no logical connection or common-sense reasoning that supports this conclusion."
4183,"INDIANAPOLIS- Four years ago, the state Supreme Court asked law firms to address a growing  Not enough lawyers were donating time for pro bono work, and thousands of people were left with no legal help in civil cases.",Supreme Court never asked law firms to address any problems.,0,0,True,"step 1: in the premise, it is stated that four years ago, the indiana supreme court asked law firms to address a growing issue of insufficient pro bono work. this means that the court recognized a problem and requested help from law firms to address it. step 2: the hypothesis contradicts the premise by suggesting that no such request was ever made. contradictory hypotheses cannot be logically inferred from their contradictory premises. step 3: based on the logical reasoning, the hypothesis cannot be inferred from the premise."
4184,Lash is associate dean at the University of Southern California Law School.,Nobody works at the University of Southern California Law School anymore.,0,0,True,"step 1: in the premise, lash is identified as an associate dean at the university of southern california law school. this indicates that there is a functioning law school at the university of southern california with staff, including lash.step 2: the hypothesis states that 'nobody works' at the university of southern california law school. this directly contradicts the premise, as lash's employment is explicitly stated.step 3: based on the logical contradiction between the premise and hypothesis, the hypothesis cannot be logically inferred from the premise."
4185,"Sharm El Sheikh and Hurghada are the largest resorts, well-equipped with hotels and eateries, with a full range of facilities such as windsurfing, water-skiing, and water  Dahab and Nuweiba on the west coast of the Sinai are smaller, with a hardened diving or windsurfing crowd great for a low key vacation.","Sharm El Sheikh is the smallest resort, and Hurghada is the second smallest.",0,0,True,"step 1: in the premise, sharm el sheikh and hurghada are identified as the largest resorts with a full range of facilities and a large number of hotels and eateries. dahab and nuweiba, on the other hand, are described as smaller resorts with a low-key vibe and catering to a specific crowd.step 2: the hypothesis directly contradicts the information given in the premise, stating that sharm el sheikh is the smallest resort and hurghada is the second smallest. the premise does not provide any evidence or logical connection to support this conclusion.step 3: based on the given information and logical reasoning, the hypothesis cannot be inferred from the premise as it contradicts the information provided."
4186,"Well, here goes, murmured Tommy to himself, and repeated his former remark.","Tommy hated to repeat himself, having to mentally prepare.",1,0,False,"step 1: in the premise, tommy is mentioned to be murmuring to himself and repeating a former remark. there is no explicit information provided about tommy's feelings or motivations for repeating himself. however, we cannot infer anything about tommy's emotions or thoughts based on this premise alone. common sense suggests that repeating something might require mental effort, but it does not necessarily mean that someone hates to do it.step 2: the hypothesis states 'tommy hated to repeat himself.' this is not logically entailed by the premise, as the premise does not provide enough information to support the hypothesis.step 3: based on the lack of explicit information in the premise regarding tommy's feelings or motivations, and the absence of logical or factual connections between the premise and hypothesis, the hypothesis is not entailed by the premise."
4187,A side chapel is said to be where the manger stood.,Nobody has memorialized the site where it is believed the manger stood.,0,0,True,"step 1: in the premise, it is mentioned that a side chapel is said to be where the manger stood. this implies that there is a historical belief or tradition that the memorable event of jesus' birth occurred in this side chapel. step 2: the hypothesis, 'nobody has memorialized the site where it is believed the manger stood', suggests that there is no physical recognition or marking of the site's significance. this does not necessarily contradict the premise, as the absence of a memorial does not automatically mean that the site is not the actual location of the manger. common sense and historical records indicate that various religious sites and artifacts often do not have visible markers or memorials, and it is possible that the site of the manger is commemorated in other ways, such as through religious ceremonies or texts. step 3: based on the given information and common sense reasoning, the hypothesis cannot be logically inferred from the premise as it does not follow necessarily and there is a possibility that the site is indeed commemorated in other ways."
4188,"Despite their efforts, however, Ibiza was menaced by so many hostile flotillas that the locals took the unprecedented step of forming their own band of privateers.",Calm soon returned to Ibiza following peaceful resolution.,0,0,True,"step 1: in the premise, ibiza is under threat from numerous hostile flotillas. the locals respond by forming a band of privateers. this suggests a state of conflict or danger in ibiza. common sense and historical context tell us that peaceful resolution does not typically follow the formation of a band of privateers, which are essentially armed groups meant for defense or retaliation. step 2: the hypothesis, 'calm soon returned to ibiza following peaceful resolution', contradicts the premise. the premise indicates that ibiza is being menaced and the locals are taking aggressive action, while the hypothesis suggests a peaceful resolution and the return of calm. step 3: based on the logical reasoning and the contradiction between the premise and hypothesis, the hypothesis is not entailed by the premise."
4189,"11 East Asian  Many trace the dive to economic slumps in Malaysia, Thailand, the Philippines, and Indonesia--which together buy 4 percent of all American exports.",Thailand doesn't buy any American exports.,0,0,True,"step 1: in the premise, it mentions that thailand, along with malaysia, the philippines, and indonesia, collectively buy 4 percent of all american exports. step 2: the hypothesis states that thailand doesn't buy any american exports. this contradicts the information provided in the premise, as thailand is specifically identified as a country that buys american exports. step 3: based on the information from the premise and the logical contradiction with the hypothesis, we conclude that the hypothesis is not entailed by the premise."
4190,You can also purchase a pair of Cretan farmer's boots almost knee-high black leather with thick leather soles.,Cretan's farmers boots are made from alligator skin. ,0,0,True,"step 1. in the premise, it is mentioned that cretan farmer's boots are almost knee-high, made of black leather, and have thick leather soles. this information does not provide any indication of the material used to make the boots, such as alligator skin.step 2. the hypothesis, stating 'cretan's farmers boots are made from alligator skin', contradicts the information provided in the premise, as there is no mention or implication of alligator skin in the description of the boots.step 3. based on the logical analysis, the hypothesis cannot be inferred from the premise, as the premise does not provide enough information to logically deduce the material used to make the cretan farmer's boots."
4191,"Slightly out of breath, she came to a halt outside the ground glass door with the legend painted across it ""Esthonia Glassware Co."" Tuppence knocked.",Tuppence did not knock on the ground glass door with the legend painted across it.,0,0,True,"step 1: in the premise, it is stated that tuppence knocked on a ground glass door with the legend 'esthonia glassware co.'. this information creates a clear picture of tuppence's action at that location. step 2: the hypothesis states that tuppence did not knock on the same door. a contradiction to the premise. step 3: based on the provided information, the hypothesis cannot be logically inferred from the premise since it contradicts the stated fact."
4192,"Peruvian President Alberto Fujimori is in deep  Citizens are angry over his alleged illegal wiretapping and suppression of journalists, and newly discovered documents indicate that he may have been born in Japan rather than Peru, which would make him ineligible for his job.",Fujimori won't confirm if he was born in Japan or Peru despite the new proof.,1,0,False,"step 1: in the premise, it is stated that peruvian president alberto fujimori is facing allegations of illegal wiretapping and suppression of journalists, and there are newly discovered documents suggesting that he might have been born in japan instead of peru. this information implies that there is public anger over his actions, and there's a controversy regarding his nationality.step 2: the hypothesis indicates that fujimori won't confirm his birthplace in the face of new proof. this behavior is not a logical contradiction of the premise, as the premise does not necessarily state that fujimori has confirmed or denied his birthplace before. in fact, the premise implies that there is uncertainty about his birthplace.step 3: based on the information in the premise and the lack of contradiction with the hypothesis, it cannot be logically inferred that fujimori's refusal to confirm his birthplace is a direct result of the allegations or the discovered documents. people might refuse to confirm their birthplace for various reasons, and this behavior is not necessarily connected to the allegations against fujimori. therefore, the hypothesis is not logically entailed by the premise.step 4: it is essential to note that while the hypothesis is not logically entailed by the premise, it is not necessarily false either. the premise does not provide enough information to determine the truth or falsity of the hypothesis."
4193,Environmental Defense hailed this legislation as a model for the country.,The Environmental Defense put a lot of effort into getting his legislation passed.,1,1,True,"step 1: the premise indicates that environmental defense has expressed approval or support for the legislation in question. this doesn't directly provide information about the amount of effort they put into getting the legislation passed, but it does suggest a strong interest or commitment to the cause.step 2: the hypothesis is logically consistent with the premise, as a significant amount of effort put into getting a bill passed could result in one's organization hailing it as a model for the country. the hypothesis doesn't contradict the premise and adds detail to our understanding of the situation.step 3: based on the lack of contradiction and the logical consistency, the hypothesis can be inferred from the premise, as the two statements describe related but distinct aspects of the same event."
4194,What'd you see? ,He did not see anything.,0,0,True,"step 1: the premise is a question asking for a report of what was seen. it does not provide any specific information about what was or was not seen by the person being asked. step 2: the hypothesis is a negation of a claim about what was seen. it states that nothing was seen. step 3: the premise does not entail the hypothesis because the premise does not provide enough information to infer that the person did not see anything. the hypothesis contradicts the premise if we assume that the person being asked is the same person referred to in the hypothesis. however, without further context or information, it is not possible to definitively say whether the hypothesis is true or false based on the premise alone. step 4: given the lack of sufficient information in the premise to logically infer the hypothesis, and the potential for contradiction depending on the specific context, it is reasonable to conclude that the hypothesis is not entailed by the premise."
4195,"If you leave the park and walk up Cotton Tree Drive, you will find the Peak Tram terminal.",There are actually tons of cotton trees lined up on Cotton Tree Drive.,1,0,False,"step 1: in the premise, 'cotton tree drive' is mentioned as the path leading to the peak tram terminal. there is no explicit statement about cotton trees being present on the road. however, the name 'cotton tree drive' suggests a possible connection to cotton trees. the presence of cotton trees would not contradict the premise, as it does not change the fact that the peak tram terminal is located at the end of the road. step 2: the hypothesis 'there are actually tons of cotton trees lined up on cotton tree drive' does not logically follow from the premise. the premise only states that the peak tram terminal is located on cotton tree drive. it does not provide sufficient information to infer the presence of a large number of cotton trees. step 3: based on the given information, the hypothesis is not entailed by the premise."
4196,"Young owns four of the 19 best-ever seasons for a quarterback, and is the highest-rated passer of all time.",Young holds a lot of records.,1,1,True,"step 1: in the premise, it is stated that young has four of the 19 best-ever seasons for a quarterback and is the highest-rated passer of all time. this implies that young has accomplished a great deal in his football career and holds numerous records or impressive achievements. step 2: the hypothesis 'young holds a lot of records' is a general statement that can be logically inferred from the premise, as the premise already suggests that young holds several records for best-ever seasons and highest-rated passing. step 3: based on the logical relationship between the premise and hypothesis, and the lack of contradictory information, the hypothesis 'young holds a lot of records' can be inferred from the premise."
4197,A male is placing an order in a deli.,A man at a deli.,1,1,True,"step 1: a male is described in the premise. the term 'male' refers to the biological sex, which includes men. therefore, a man is one type of male. step 2: the hypothesis uses the term 'man' which is a synonym for 'male'. thus, a man is a more specific instance of a male. step 3: given the information provided, the hypothesis is logically entailed by the premise."
4198,what does um is Robby Robin Williams does he have a funny part in the movie or is,How much went into making the movie?,1,0,False,"step 1. in the premise, 'what does um' refers to an incomplete question, likely asking about a specific aspect of robby robin williams or his role in the movie. 'robby robin williams' is the name of a character or person, and 'does he have a funny part in the movie' is an inquiry into his comedic performance. the hypothesis, 'how much went into making the movie', is a completely different question, unrelated to the information or implications of the premise.step 2. the hypothesis cannot be logically inferred from the premise as they address different aspects of the movie and robby robin williams' character. the hypothesis is not a logical consequence or implication of the premise.step 3. based on the logical analysis, the hypothesis is not entailed by the premise."
4199,yeah i'll try that i sure will,"no way, I won't touch that",0,0,True,"step 1: in the premise, the speaker expresses an intention to try something. there is no specific information about what is being tried or what the outcome might be. in the hypothesis, the speaker expresses a negated intention, stating that they will not do something. the meaning of both sentences is subjective and depends on the context. however, the hypothesis contradicts the premise as it implies that the opposite intention is held.step 2: the hypothesis cannot be logically inferred from the premise as the premise does not provide sufficient information to deduce the hypothesis. in fact, the hypothesis contradicts the premise.step 3: based on the logical analysis, the hypothesis is not entailed by the premise."
4200,"No, don't dismiss it.",Let it go free immediately.,0,0,True,"step 1: in the premise, the speaker is giving a directive, 'no,' to someone or something. the meaning of 'no' is to deny or refuse something. the hypothesis, 'let it go free immediately,' is also a directive, but it is a command to allow something or someone to be free or released. this information does not provide enough context to determine a logical relationship between the premise and hypothesis.step 2: the hypothesis does not directly follow or contradict the premise. there is no entailment or logical connection between the two statements.step 3: based on the given information, the hypothesis cannot be inferred from the premise."
4201,You'll be able to choose from the naave to the sophisticated.,You can also choose from the poor to the rich.,1,1,True,"step 1: the premise suggests that there is a range or spectrum of options available, with 'naive' and 'sophisticated' being two extremes. no specific limitations are mentioned regarding the nature or origin of these options. step 2: the hypothesis introduces a new range of options, namely 'poor' and 'rich'. these new options can be seen as related to, or overlapping with, the options mentioned in the premise. for instance, some 'naive' options could be 'poor' and some 'sophisticated' options could be 'rich'. step 3: the hypothesis can be inferred from the premise, as it is a generalization or extension of the options mentioned in the premise. the range of options in the hypothesis does not contradict or negate the premise, but rather expands upon it. step 4: the hypothesis is logically entailed by the premise, as it is a valid extension of the possibilities implied in the premise."
4202,yeah because like what,No because why even,0,0,True,"step 1. in this case, both the premise and hypothesis lack clear and specific information, making it difficult to identify key relationships or logical connections. the premise is a fragmented sentence without a clear subject or predicate, while the hypothesis is a negation of an affirmative statement without providing an alternative. without a clear and specific premise, it's impossible to determine if the hypothesis can be logically inferred or contradicts it.step 2. due to the lack of clear information in the premise and hypothesis, it's impossible to make a definitive analysis of the relationship between the two. there is no logical connection or contradiction that can be established based on the given information.step 3. based on the logical reasoning, lack of clear and specific information in both the premise and hypothesis, and the impossibility of determining a logical relationship or contradiction, the hypothesis cannot be reasonably inferred from the premise.step 4. the lack of a clear and specific premise and hypothesis in this example makes it impossible to determine if there is entailment or not."
4204,Its roof affords a splendid panoramic view across the canals and La Petite France to the soaring silhouette of the cathedral.,La Petite France cannot be seen from the roof.,0,0,True,"step 1: in the premise, it is stated that the roof offers a panoramic view of the canals and la petite france, as well as the cathedral. this implies that the observer on the roof has a clear line of sight to both the canals and la petite france. common sense and logical consistency suggest that 'affording a view' and 'not being able to see' are mutually exclusive.step 2: the hypothesis contradicts the information in the premise, as it states that la petite france cannot be seen from the roof. since the hypothesis contradicts the premise, it cannot be logically inferred from the premise.step 3: based on the logical inconsistency between the premise and hypothesis, and the lack of any information in the premise that would support the hypothesis, the hypothesis is not entailed by the premise."
4205,"In evolutionary terms, this makes sense.",Evolution explains this.,1,1,True,"step 1: both the premise and hypothesis refer to the concept of evolution explaining certain phenomena. no contradiction is present between the two statements.step 2: the hypothesis is a more general statement that can be inferred from the premise. the premise implies that the concept of evolution makes sense in a given context, and the hypothesis states that evolution in general explains such phenomena.step 3: based on the logical relationship between the premise and hypothesis and the lack of contradictory information, the hypothesis can be inferred from the premise."
4206,A more controversial measure of personal saving would include changes in the value of existing assets.,Personal saving could include changes in the value of your home.,1,1,True,"step 1: in the premise, 'personal saving' is described as typically measured, but a more controversial method includes changes in the value of existing assets. this suggests that the usual definition of personal saving (money set aside from income) is being expanded to include changes in the value of assets. 'existing assets' is a broad term that could include many things, such as stocks, bonds, or real estate. a home is a common form of real estate and can be considered a personal asset. step 2: the hypothesis suggests that 'personal saving' could include changes in the value of your home. this is consistent with the broader definition of personal saving described in the premise. it is reasonable to infer that changes in the value of a home could be considered part of personal saving, as they represent a form of financial security or wealth accumulation. step 3: based on the logical reasoning and the expanded definition of personal saving provided in the premise, the hypothesis can be inferred from the premise."
4207,She noted that we have to help patients who have severe alcohol problems.,Patients wit severe alcohol problems can be completely ignored. ,0,0,True,"step 1: in the premise, 'she noted that we have to help patients who have severe alcohol problems,' the speaker is expressing a responsibility or obligation to provide assistance to patients with severe alcohol issues. this implies a moral or ethical obligation to care for these individuals.step 2: the hypothesis 'patients with severe alcohol problems can be completely ignored' contradicts the premise. it suggests the exact opposite action - to not help or even to ignore these patients. given the clear statement of a responsibility to help these patients in the premise, the hypothesis cannot be logically inferred.step 3: based on the logical inconsistency between the premise and hypothesis, and the fact that the hypothesis contradicts the stated obligation in the premise, the hypothesis cannot be inferred from the premise."
4209,"Sharon has especially exploited Kosovo to court Israel's 1 million new Russian immigrants, whose votes are expected to decide the election's outcome.",A million Russians came to Israel in the past year.,1,1,True,step 1. the premise states that sharon has used kosovo to attract 1 million russian immigrants to israel and that their votes are crucial for the election's outcome. the premise implies a recent increase in russian immigration due to its significance to the election. step 2. the hypothesis suggests that 1 million russians came to israel in the past year. this statement is a specific instance of the premise's implication of a recent increase in russian immigration. step 3. the hypothesis can be inferred from the premise as it is a more precise version of the premise's implication. the hypothesis does not contradict the premise and is a reasonable consequence of the premise's information.
4210,Adam's pose in the Creation scene (top left) inspired the Michelangelo figure reaching out to God on the Sistine Chapel ceiling.,"In the Creation scene, Adam is sitting down.",1,0,False,"step 1: in the premise, it is stated that adam's pose in the creation scene inspired michelangelo's figure reaching out to god on the sistine chapel ceiling. this implies that the pose of adam in the creation scene is significant and influential. however, the description of adam's pose is not directly mentioned in the premise.step 2: the hypothesis asserts that adam is sitting down in the creation scene. this pose would be quite different from the reaching pose described in the premise.step 3: based on the information provided, it cannot be logically inferred that adam was sitting down in the creation scene based on the premise. the premise describes the influence of adam's pose, but it does not specify the actual pose. therefore, the hypothesis contradicts the information in the premise.step 4: given that the hypothesis contradicts the premise, it cannot be logically inferred from it."
4211,AUTHORITY TO BORROW - Authority to borrow is a subset of budget authority.,Most mangers prefer to have an authority to borrow within their own departments.,1,1,True,"step 1: in the premise, 'authority to borrow' is identified as a subset of 'budget authority'. this means that 'authority to borrow' is a specific type of budget authority. no contradictory information is provided in the premise.step 2: the hypothesis suggests 'most managers' prefer to have an 'authority to borrow' within their own departments. this preference indicates that these managers have the ability or power to borrow funds for their specific departmental needs.step 3: given the information from the premise and the common-sense understanding that managers need flexibility to handle departmental expenses, it is reasonable to infer that 'most managers' having an 'authority to borrow' is a logical consequence of 'authority to borrow' being a subset of 'budget authority'. this is because having the power to borrow is a crucial part of managing a department's budget.step 4: in conclusion, the hypothesis is a logical consequence of the premise, as indicated by the 'most managers' having the 'authority to borrow' being a necessary part of effectively managing a department's budget."
4212,The doctor looked at them all curiously.,The doctor looked at their scars with curiosity.,1,1,True,"step 1: the premise describes the doctor's behavior as 'looking at them curiously.' the term 'them' is ambiguous and could refer to various things or people. however, in the absence of additional context, it's reasonable to assume that 'them' refers to the patients or people present in the room. in the medical context, it's common for doctors to show curiosity when examining wounds or scars. step 2: the hypothesis narrows the focus of the premise by stating that the doctor looked at 'their scars' with curiosity. given the common sense understanding that doctors may examine scars with curiosity, this hypothesis can be logically inferred from the premise. step 3: based on the logical reasoning, common sense, and lack of contradictory information, the hypothesis can be inferred from the premise."
4213,"What there is in the way of stylized leaps, spins, and balancing on the toes comes out as the natural expression of exceptionally graceful human beings and not as a demonstration of what some clever windup toys can do.",Balancing on the toes comes out as an unnatural expression.,0,0,True,"step 1: in the premise, 'stylized leaps, spins, and balancing on the toes' are described as the natural expression of exceptionally graceful human beings. this implies that these actions are typical of humans and considered a sign of grace and agility. 'balancing on the toes' is mentioned as one such expression. step 2: the hypothesis suggests that 'balancing on the toes' is an unnatural expression. this directly contradicts the premise, as the premise states that this behavior is a natural expression of graceful human beings. step 3: based on the logical contradiction between the premise and hypothesis, the hypothesis cannot be inferred from the premise."
4214,How was he to know? ,How did he miss that?,0,0,True,"step 1: neither the premise nor the hypothesis directly provide any specific information about a person, an action, or a situation. they are both rhetorical questions used to express doubt or disbelief. the premise is asking 'how was he to know' implying a lack of awareness or understanding. the hypothesis is asking 'how did he miss that' implying a failure to perceive or notice something.step 2: neither the premise nor the hypothesis state anything that can be logically inferred from each other. they are independent statements expressing different aspects of doubt or disbelief.step 3: based on the given information and logical analysis, there is no entailment relationship between the premise and the hypothesis."
4215,"If you insist on sticking to imported Scotch or Bourbon, expect to pay a relative fortune.",The import tax is high in our country.,1,1,True,"step 1: in the premise, it is stated that imported scotch or bourbon is expensive due to the relative fortune one must pay. this implies that there is a significant cost associated with importing these liquors. common sense and economic principles suggest that high costs are often due to taxes or tariffs. thus, the hinted high cost could be a result of import taxes. step 2: the hypothesis that 'the import tax is high in our country' is a reasonable explanation for the high cost indicated in the premise. it logically follows that high import taxes would result in the need to pay a relative fortune for imported goods. step 3: based on the logical reasoning and lack of contradictory information, the hypothesis can be inferred from the premise."
4216,David Clift was the first Executive Director 1958 - 1972,"David Clift served as Secretary from 1951-1958, and was the first Executive Director (1958-1972)",1,0,False,"step 1. in the premise, it is stated that david clift was the first executive director from 1958 to 1972. no other relevant information is provided. step 2. the hypothesis suggests that david clift had a different role (secretary) before becoming the executive director. however, the premise does not mention or contradict any such information. step 3. given that there is no contradiction or inconsistency between the premise and hypothesis, and no logical impossibility, it is theoretically possible for the hypothesis to be true. however, the premise alone does not provide enough information to logically infer the hypothesis as it does not mention anything about david clift's role before becoming the executive director. thus, based on the given information, the hypothesis is not entailed by the premise. step 4. it's important to note that the absence of evidence is not evidence of absence. while the premise does not disprove the hypothesis, it also does not provide sufficient proof to establish it as true."
4218,That is why icons have the power they have.,That is why icons have the power to move yoou.,1,0,False,"step 1: in the premise, 'that is why' implies an explanation for 'icons have the power they have'. the context does not provide any specific information about the nature of this power or the reason why icons have it. the hypothesis introduces a new subject 'you' and asserts 'icons have the power to move you', which is different from the premise. there is no apparent logical connection between the premise and hypothesis based on the given information.step 2: the hypothesis contradicts the premise because it introduces a new meaning for 'power' and 'why' that is not supported or implied in the premise. the hypothesis is not a logical inference from the premise.step 3: based on the given information, the hypothesis cannot be logically inferred from the premise."
4219,"Comrade, he said to me, our Five Year Plan for the People's Aesthetics proceeds on schedule.",The Five Year Plan for the People's Aesthetics is going slowly and behind schedule.,0,0,True,"step 1: the premise states that the five year plan for the people's aesthetics is proceeding on schedule. this implies that the plan is progressing according to its intended timeline. step 2: the hypothesis suggests that the five year plan for the people's aesthetics is going slowly and behind schedule, which directly contradicts the information provided in the premise. step 3: given the clear contradiction between the premise and hypothesis, no entailment exists."
4220,"Originally, these provisos permitted the use of LSC funds for legal assistance to an alien if the alien was a resident of the United States and fell within one of the permissible alien categories, all of which required that an alien was in lawful status.",The LSC is not allowed to use their funds to help illegal immigrants. ,0,0,True,"step 1: the premise describes the original use of lsc funds for legal assistance to aliens, specifying that aliens must be residents of the united states and fall within permissible alien categories, which all require lawful status. this indicates that the lsc's use of funds for aliens is contingent on their lawful status.step 2: the hypothesis states that the lsc is not allowed to use their funds to help illegal immigrants. this proposition directly contradicts the information in the premise, as it suggests that the lsc cannot help aliens who are in lawful status, not just those who are illegal.step 3: based on the contradiction between the premise and hypothesis, it is clear that the hypothesis cannot be logically inferred from the premise. the premise allows for the use of lsc funds for legal assistance to aliens in lawful status, and the hypothesis asserts that such use is not allowed at all. these positions are incompatible.step 4: it is important to note that the premise and hypothesis may still be factually true, but they express different rules or regulations. the premise describes the historical use of lsc funds, while the hypothesis may reflect a current restriction or limitation on those funds."
4221,cool yeah BS that's the way to do it,To BS is only one way to do it.,1,0,False,"step 1: the premise is a colloquial expression, 'bs' likely refers to bluffing or exaggerating. it does not provide any factual or logical information about a specific event or situation. the hypothesis is a statement that there is only one way to 'bs'. step 2: without any premise-related context or information, it is impossible to logically infer the hypothesis from the premise. the hypothesis introduces a new concept ('only one way to do it') that is not present or implied in the premise. step 3: based on the lack of logical connection and the absence of sufficient context, the hypothesis cannot be inferred from the premise."
4222,It depends on how you score it.,It doesn't depend on the way you score it.,0,0,True,"step 1: in the premise, 'it depends on how you score it' implies that the outcome or truth value of a statement can vary based on the scoring method used. this is a common way to express subjectivity or ambiguity in language. in contrast, the hypothesis states that 'it doesn't depend on the way you score it,' suggesting a lack of dependence on scoring methods.step 2: analyzing the relationship between the premise and hypothesis reveals an apparent contradiction. if the truth value or outcome depends on the scoring method, then it does not 'not depend on the way you score it.' therefore, the hypothesis cannot be logically inferred from the premise based on the information provided.step 3: the hypothesis is not entailed by the premise, as the premise and hypothesis present conflicting statements."
4224,Weather obsessives shop on the Web.,People who are obsessed with the weather spend more than those who are not concerned with it.,1,1,True,"step 1: in the premise, 'weather obsessives' are identified as a group of people. the term 'obsessives' implies a strong interest or concern for the weather. 'shop on the web' indicates an action taken, likely implying a financial transaction. no contradictory facts or logical principles are present in the premise.step 2: the hypothesis states that 'people who are obsessed with the weather spend more than those who are not concerned with it'. this hypothesis can be logically inferred from the premise because the premise establishes a connection between being a weather obssesive and shopping online, and it is a common assumption that online shopping often involves spending more money than usual.step 3: based on the logical connection between the premise and hypothesis, and the common-sense assumption that online shopping typically involves more spending, the hypothesis can be inferred from the premise."
4225,(Martha does not appear at all in the current issue of Living .) The zooming stock price is evidence that Wall Street can distinguish Martha from her product.,Martha was in the last issue of living.,1,0,False,"step 1: in the premise, it is stated that martha is not present in the current issue of living magazine. the hypothesis, on the other hand, asserts that martha was in the last issue. the premise and hypothesis discuss martha's presence or absence in living magazine issues.step 2: the premise and hypothesis are not logically related. the absence of martha in the current issue does not infer or logically lead to the presence of martha in the previous issue. there is no causal connection between the two statements.step 3: based on the logical analysis, the hypothesis cannot be logically inferred from the premise.step 4: furthermore, the premise and hypothesis make contradictory statements about martha's presence in the living magazine issues. the premise states that she is not present in the current issue, while the hypothesis asserts that she was in the previous issue.therefore, the hypothesis is not logically entailed by the premise."
4226,These and other inefficiencies point to the need for a nationally coordinated approach that could reduce cost while improving environmental progress and accountability.,Nationally coordinated approaches have worked well for other agencies in the past.,1,1,True,"step 1: in the premise, it is suggested that there are inefficiencies and the need for improvement in environmental progress and accountability. the statement implies that a nationally coordinated approach could address these issues. step 2: the hypothesis states that nationally coordinated approaches have worked well for other agencies in the past. this inference is reasonable because if nationally coordinated approaches have been successful in improving efficiency, environmental progress, and accountability for other agencies, then implementing the same approach for the specific issue mentioned in the premise could potentially yield similar results. step 3: based on the logical reasoning that a solution that has been effective in the past could be applicable to a similar situation, the hypothesis is a reasonable inference from the premise.step 4: it is also important to note that there is no contradictory information provided in the premise or hypothesis that would negate the possibility of a nationally coordinated approach being effective.therefore, the hypothesis is entailed by the premise."
4227,it wasn't as if a a new government was established when they were already here,There was not as much change happening as that kind of difference would imply. ,1,1,True,"step 1. in the premise, 'it wasn't as if a new government was established' implies that a government was already present when certain individuals arrived. this suggests continuity in governance.step 2. the hypothesis 'there was not as much change happening as that kind of difference would imply' can be inferred from the premise based on the common-sense understanding that the establishment of a new government often brings significant changes to a society or institution. the fact that no new government was established implies that the existing structure and processes remained relatively stable.step 3. the hypothesis is a logical consequence of the premise, as the premise implies the absence of significant change and the hypothesis states that 'there was not as much change happening'."
4228,but i used to work for a power company so it was very important that they make sure their employees especially linemen,I am an expert on the behavior of circuses when it comes to the employment of their linemen.,0,0,True,"step 1: in the premise, the speaker describes their past employment with a power company and the importance of ensuring employee expertise, specifically for linemen. this implies that the power industry places a high value on the competence of linemen.step 2: the hypothesis asserts that the speaker is an expert on the behavior of circuses regarding the employment of their linemen. however, there is no logical connection or information in the premise that implies the speaker now works for a circus or has any expertise in that area.step 3: based on the given information, the hypothesis cannot be logically inferred from the premise as there is no supporting evidence or logical relationship between the two statements."
4229,"The third season debuted on January 11, 2012 with 1,361,000 viewers, and the season finale drew 968,000 viewers.","The third season debuted on January 12, 2012 with 1,361,000 viewers, and the season finale drew 968,000 viewers.",0,1,False,"step 1. the premise provides the specific dates and viewer numbers for the debut and finale episodes of the third season. no logical connections or contradictions are present in the premise. step 2. the hypothesis is identical to the premise except for the date of the debut episode. since the date of the debut episode does not affect the number of viewers or the subsequent events, the hypothesis can be considered logically equivalent to the premise. step 3. based on the logical equivalence of the hypothesis and the premise, the hypothesis can be inferred from the premise.step 4. (optional) while the hypothesis can be logically inferred from the premise, it is important to note that the hypothesis is factually incorrect if we consider real-world information. the premise states that the debut episode was on january 11, 2012, and the hypothesis incorrectly states january 12, 2012. this serves as a reminder that logical entailment does not equal factual accuracy."
4230,"Hold hard, said Tommy.","""Don't hold at all!"" was Tommy's only message.",0,0,True,"step 1: the premise 'hold hard, said tommy' indicates that tommy gave an instruction to someone to hold something firmly. it does not provide any information about any other messages or statements made by tommy.step 2: the hypothesis 'don't hold at all!' suggests an instruction to let go of whatever is being held. this instruction contradicts the instruction given in the premise.step 3: based on the given information, it cannot be reasonably inferred that 'don't hold at all!' was tommy's only message. the premise and hypothesis are inconsistent with each other."
4231,Judy Woodruff had a compromise.,Judy Woodruff compromised on what questions she would ask.,1,1,True,"step 1: a compromise implies that there is an agreement reached between two or more parties, where each side gives something up to reach a resolution. in this context, the premise suggests that judy woodruff was in a situation where she had to make such an agreement.step 2: the hypothesis directly relates to the premise as it describes a specific action that judy woodruff took in the context of a compromise. it is a reasonable inference that if someone had a compromise, they likely compromised on certain aspects of the agreement.step 3: based on the logical connection between the two statements and the common sense understanding of the meaning of a compromise, the hypothesis can be inferred from the premise."
4233,"Try Loughrigg and Loughrigg Terrace, easily reached from Grasmere village, for superb views of Windermere and Grasmere lakes.",The terrace is impossible to get to.,0,0,True,"step 1: in the premise, loughrigg terrace is described as a location that is easily reachable from grasmere village. this implies that there is some means of access to the terrace. the mention of 'superb views' suggests that the location is worth visiting. step 2: the hypothesis 'the terrace is impossible to get to' directly contradicts the information provided in the premise. the premise states that the location is easily reachable from the village, while the hypothesis asserts that it is impossible to get there. step 3: based on the logical contradiction between the premise and hypothesis, the hypothesis cannot be logically inferred from the premise."
4234,"In the Phoenix case, the bounty hunters claimed that they were pursuing a skip but accidentally raided the wrong address.",The people in the house that the bounty houses raided were very angry when accidentally raided.,1,1,True,"step 1: in the premise, bounty hunters were pursuing a 'skip' or a fugitive from justice. they mistakenly raided the wrong address. the hypothesis states that the people in the house were angry when they were raided. both sentences describe events that occurred at the same residence.step 2: it is a common sense assumption that people would be angry when their home is unexpectedly raided by bounty hunters or any law enforcement personnel. this emotion is a typical response to such an intrusion. furthermore, there is no information in the premise that contradicts the hypothesis.step 3: based on the logical reasoning and common sense understanding, the hypothesis can be inferred from the premise."
4236,"'I can't, but the computer can.' Daniel said.",Daniel wanted to learn what the computer knew. ,1,0,False,"step 1: the premise indicates that daniel acknowledged a task he couldn't perform, but mentioned the computer as being capable of it. this does not provide any direct information about daniel's intentions or motivations.step 2: the hypothesis suggests that daniel wanted to learn from the computer, but this is not an inherent implication of the premise. there could be various reasons why daniel might want the computer to perform the task instead of him.step 3: based on the given information, it is not logically possible to infer the hypothesis from the premise as the premise does not provide sufficient evidence for the hypothesis.label: 0"
4238,It was nearer his own than any Dave had heard on this world.,It didn't sound anything like his own.,0,0,True,"step 1: in the premise, 'it' refers to a sound that is described as being 'nearer his own' than any other sound 'dave had heard on this world'. this implies that 'it' is a sound that is similar to, or familiar to, the speaker, 'dave'. the second sentence, the hypothesis, states that 'it didn't sound anything like his own'. this indicates a contradiction, as the premise suggests that 'it' is similar to, or familiar to, 'dave', while the hypothesis suggests that it is not. however, without further context, it's difficult to definitively determine if the hypothesis can be logically inferred from the premise.step 2: the hypothesis contradicts the premise, as it suggests that the sound is not familiar to 'dave', while the premise suggests that it is.step 3: based on the given information, the hypothesis cannot be logically inferred from the premise, as it contradicts the premise."
4239,"There's a small hole, high up in the wall.","The wall is solid, there are no holes in it.",0,0,True,"step 1: in the premise, a small hole is described as being present, high up in the wall. this means that the wall does not have a solid, unbroken surface in that particular location. step 2: the hypothesis asserts that the wall is solid and there are no holes in it, which directly contradicts the premise. step 3: based on the logical negation of the premise's information, the hypothesis cannot be inferred from the premise."
4240,yeah and they've got those bins that just stay there and they decorated them real cute you know with a bunch of big old flowers and stuff,"The bins just stay there and are decorated, I'm not sure if the decorations help.",1,0,False,"step 1: in the premise, it is mentioned that there are bins that are left there permanently and are decorated with flowers and other decorations. the decorations are not explicitly stated as being functional, but rather ornamental. step 2: the hypothesis states that the bins just stay there and are decorated, implying that the decorations are not necessarily functional. this hypothesis is consistent with the information given in the premise, as the premise does not state or suggest anything about the functionality of the decorations. step 3: based on the given information and the logical consistency of the hypothesis with the premise, the hypothesis can be considered as not being entailed by the premise, but also not contradicting it. the hypothesis is a valid description of the situation that can be inferred from the premise, but it does not follow logically from the premise as it adds no new information beyond what is already stated."
4241,exercise tends to be a a topic that i guess i've never developed any will power to maintain any regular program i uh,I have been in a regular program for three years now.,0,0,True,"step 1: in the premise, the speaker expresses a lack of will power to maintain a regular exercise program. this is a statement about their past behavior or attitude towards exercise.step 2: the hypothesis asserts that the speaker has been in a regular exercise program for three years. this directly contradicts the premise, as the premise states that the speaker has never maintained a regular exercise program.step 3: based on the given information, the hypothesis 'i have been in a regular program for three years now' cannot be logically inferred from the premise 'exercise tends to be a topic that i guess i've never developed any will power to maintain any regular program'. the hypothesis contradicts the premise and is not a logical consequence of it."
4242,"This was once the commercial center of the Old Town, including a weekly fabric market.",The weekly fabric market continues today as a craft and farmer's market.,1,1,True,"step 1: the premise describes the historical commercial center of the old town, which included a weekly fabric market. this means that, in the past, people would come to this location to buy and sell fabric on a weekly basis. step 2: the hypothesis suggests that the weekly fabric market continues today in the form of a craft and farmer's market. this implies that the market, although possibly not exclusively focusing on fabric, still operates on a weekly basis and offers various goods for sale. step 3: given the information from the premise and the hypothesis, it can be inferred that the weekly market, while possibly having a broader focus now, still maintains its weekly nature and continues to be an important part of the old town's commercial activity. therefore, the hypothesis is a logical extension of the premise as it describes a continuation of the historical weekly market in a different but related form. step 4: based on the logical connection between the premise and hypothesis, common sense reasoning, and the consistency of the information provided, the hypothesis is entailed by the premise."
4243,"The house is famed for its gardens particularly its rhododendrons, which were highly prized at the end of the 19th century and its beautiful setting; from here you can marvel at panoramic views of the lake and Skiddaw Peak and Blenthcathra beyond.",The gardens are located in an English county.,1,1,True,"step 1: the premise describes the house and its famed gardens, mentioning that they are particularly known for their rhododendrons and the beautiful views of the lake and surrounding peaks. it does not explicitly state the location of the house or gardens, but it is common sense and a reasonable assumption that they are located in england, as england is well-known for its gardens and beautiful landscapes, including those with rhododendrons. step 2: the hypothesis states that the gardens are located in an english county. this hypothesis can be logically inferred from the premise because the premise implies that the house and gardens are located in england. step 3: based on the logical reasoning and the common-sense assumption, the hypothesis is entailed by the premise."
4244,Compliance with these critical factors can increase the likelihood that an acquisition will meet an agency's needs at a reasonable cost and in a timely manner.,Compliance with those critical factors can increase the likelihood that an acquisition will meet the agency's staffing needs.,1,1,True,"step 1: in the premise, 'critical factors' are mentioned as elements that, when complied with, can increase the likelihood of an acquisition meeting an agency's needs at a reasonable cost and in a timely manner. this implies that these factors are essential for a successful acquisition. step 2: the hypothesis introduces a new context, 'agency's staffing needs,' which is related to the initial context of 'agency's needs.' the relationship is close enough that it's reasonable to assume that if compliance with critical factors can help meet the broader needs, it could also help meet staffing-specific needs. step 3: based on the logical connection between the two contexts, the hypothesis can be reasonably inferred from the premise.step 4: it is essential to note that the premise does not explicitly state that the critical factors affect staffing needs. however, it's a common-sense assumption that many factors influencing an acquisition's overall success can also impact the acquisition's ability to meet staffing requirements. for instance, factors like cost, timeliness, and quality can all be crucial for efficiently staffing a project or organization.step 5: given the lack of contradictory information in the premise or hypothesis, and the logical connection between the two, the hypothesis can be considered a valid inference from the premise."
4245,Now the tradition of open-air discussion continues over coffee or a glass of wine on some cafe terrace on the boulevard St-Michel or in the streets around the faculty buildings.,Traditional discussions are not allowed outdoors at all.  ,0,0,True,"step 1: in the premise, it is described that the tradition of open-discussion continues outdoors on cafe terraces or streets around faculty buildings. this implies that open-discussions are allowed outdoors. step 2: the hypothesis states that traditional discussions are not allowed outdoors at all, which directly contradicts the premise. step 3: based on the logical negation of the hypothesis in relation to the premise, the hypothesis is not entailed by the premise."
4247,It should also be noted that decreasing the amount of time provided to install control technologies to meet a given strategy has the potential to affect the cost of compliance as this will accelerate their installation.,Installation will be accelerated.,1,1,True,"step 1: in the premise, it is mentioned that decreasing the amount of time for installing control technologies can affect the cost of compliance. this implies a cause-and-effect relationship between the time provided for installation and the cost of compliance. the hypothesis suggests that the installation process will be accelerated. step 2: the hypothesis 'installation will be accelerated' is logically consistent with the premise. the premise states that decreasing the time for installation could have the effect of increasing the cost of compliance, but it does not necessarily mean that the installation process itself will not be accelerated. in fact, accelerating the installation process could potentially lead to cost savings in other areas, such as labor or equipment costs. step 3: based on the information provided in the premise and the logical consistency between the premise and hypothesis, the hypothesis can be inferred from the premise."
4248,"Koko-en actually comprises nine distinct gardens, each with a special theme such as bamboo, pine trees, seedlings, summer trees, and flowers.",Koko-en gardens have fun theme to go by so you know where you're going.,1,1,True,"step 1: the premise describes koko-en as comprising nine distinct gardens, each with a special theme. this indicates that the gardens have a deliberate organization and arrangement based on different themes. step 2: the hypothesis suggests that 'koko-en gardens have a fun theme to go by so you know where you're going.' this inference is based on the understanding that 'fun' can be interpreted as enjoyable, entertaining, or engaging. given that the gardens are specifically themed, it can be reasonably assumed that they are designed to provide an enjoyable experience for visitors. the hypothesis does not contradict the premise, as it is an additional implication of the given information. step 3: based on the logical reasoning that the gardens are themed and the common-sense understanding that themed gardens can be enjoyable, the hypothesis can be inferred from the premise."
4249,"However, a change would not seem likely to have a negative impact, since, in contrast to the current policy, it would be consistent with the airlines' position that frequent flyer miles belong to the individual traveler.",Individuals are groups of people or businesses that work as a team to achieve a goal.,0,0,True,"step 1: in the premise, the author states that a change in policy regarding frequent flyer miles would not have a negative impact because it aligns with the airlines' stance that miles belong to the individual traveler. this implies that the focus is on the relationship between the airlines and individual travelers, and there's no information provided about any potential impact on groups of people or businesses. step 2: in the hypothesis, 'individuals are groups of people or businesses that work as a team to achieve a goal,' the term 'individuals' refers to groups of people or businesses. this meaning is unrelated to the premise's context, where 'individuals' means single people. step 3: since the hypothesis does not follow logically from the premise, as they refer to different meanings of the term 'individuals,' the hypothesis cannot be inferred from the premise.step 4: the hypothesis is about a concept unrelated to the information provided in the premise, so no common-sense reasoning or factual consistency can be used to establish a connection between the two.therefore, based on the given information, logical principles, and common-sense reasoning, the hypothesis is not entailed by the premise."
4250,Trade unions are prohibited from carrying out political activities and may not associate with political parties.,Trade unions are prohibited from carrying out political activities and may not associate with political parties or receive finances from political parties.,1,1,True,"step 1: in the premise, it is stated that trade unions are prohibited from carrying out political activities and may not associate with political parties. this implies that trade unions have no involvement in political matters. step 2: the hypothesis adds an additional clause stating that trade unions may not receive finances from political parties. this is a logical extension of the premise, as the prohibition of political association could naturally include the prohibition of financial support from political parties. if a trade union is forbidden from being associated with a political party, it follows that they would also be forbidden from receiving finances from that party. step 3: based on the logical extension of the information in the premise, the hypothesis can be inferred from the premise."
4251,"The best of the local beaches, most of which are pebbly, is south at Albir, between Altea and the Sierra Helada.",Albir is the least pebbly of all the beaches in the region and has the most activities. ,1,0,False,"step 1. in the premise, albir is identified as the best local beach, despite most of the local beaches being pebbly. this implies that albir, despite being among the pebbly beaches, stands out for some other desirable qualities. step 2. the hypothesis proposes an alternative quality of albir: it is the least pebbly beach and has the most activities. to evaluate the hypothesis, we need to consider if it is consistent with or contradicts the information in the premise. the hypothesis does not contradict the premise, as it does not state that albir is not the best beach. however, it extends the information about albir's characteristics by adding 'least pebbly' and 'most activities'. step 3. to determine if the hypothesis is logically inferred from the premise, we need to consider if the hypothesis follows logically from the given information. while the premise does not explicitly state that albir is the least pebbly beach or has the most activities, it does not contradict these possibilities. common sense and logical reasoning suggest that a beach could have multiple desirable qualities, and being the best does not necessarily mean having the least pebbles or the most activities. however, without additional information, it is impossible to definitively prove that the hypothesis is true, as it goes beyond the information given in the premise. step 4. based on the logical reasoning and the lack of contradiction, the hypothesis is not logically inferred from the premise, but it is a possibility that could be consistent with the given information."
4252,well uh you know the only person i've ever known that had a hole in one was my brother-in-law but uh and he he said he got his luckily so i don't know that's that's but i mean,I was so proud of my brother-in-law though he was quite modest about it.,1,0,False,"step 1: in the premise, the speaker shares an anecdote about their brother-in-law having a hole in one in golf. the speaker expresses uncertainty about the authenticity of this achievement due to their brother-in-law's modest claims. step 2: the hypothesis describes the speaker's emotional state – being proud of their brother-in-law. pride is a feeling that is typically associated with accomplishments or achievements. given that the speaker doesn't question their brother-in-law's golfing ability or the hole-in-one achievement itself, it can be inferred that the speaker is proud of the brother-in-law's achievement, even if the speaker expresses some doubt about its authenticity. step 3: based on the information provided in the premise and the logical connection between feeling proud and accomplishments or achievements, the hypothesis can be inferred from the premise.step 4: it is essential to note that even though the hypothesis can be inferred, the premise does not necessarily entail the truth of the hypothesis. the speaker's statement about being proud of their brother-in-law does not contradict the information in the premise, but it does add additional information."
4253,yeah so i i trotted back to the car rather quickly uh jumped in went home and took a hot shower and changed clothes and went back,I did not even stop to have anything to eat.,1,0,False,"step 1: in the premise, the speaker mentions going home, taking a hot shower, and changing clothes. this sequence of actions does not explicitly include having something to eat. however, it does not contradict the hypothesis that the speaker did not eat anything. common sense suggests that taking a shower and changing clothes does not necessarily imply eating a meal. step 2: the hypothesis 'i did not even stop to have anything to eat' is consistent with the information in the premise since the premise does not state that the speaker had anything to eat. the hypothesis does not contradict the premise. step 3: based on the logical reasoning and lack of contradictory information, the hypothesis 'i did not even stop to have anything to eat' is not entailed by the premise, but it is not contradictory to it either."
4254,right right you know you you you'd you get the first you know the first first ice uh storm and the place closes up,The snow trucks come out when there's an ice storm.,1,1,True,"step 1: in the premise, it is stated that during the first ice storm, a place closes up. this implies that there are unfavorable weather conditions preventing access to the place.step 2: the hypothesis suggests that snow trucks come out during an ice storm. the presence of snow trucks implies that they are used for snow removal, which is a common response to snowy or icy weather conditions.step 3: given the information from steps 1 and 2, it can be logically inferred that the snow trucks coming out is a reasonable response to the ice storm mentioned in the premise. therefore, the hypothesis can be inferred from the premise.label: 1"
4256,These comments were reviewed and considered as discussed in the preamble to the final rule.,These comments were considered as part of the conclusion.,0,1,False,"step 1: the premise indicates that the comments were reviewed and considered during the discussions leading up to the final rule. this implies that the comments had an influence on the rule-making process. step 2: the hypothesis suggests that the comments were part of the conclusion itself, which is a logical extension of them being considered during the rule-making process. it is common sense that considering comments would involve taking them into account when forming a conclusion. step 3: based on the logical implications, common sense reasoning, and the lack of contradictory information, the hypothesis can be inferred from the premise."
4257,A person walking uphill from a construction zone.,The person is walking down stairs.,0,0,True,"step 1: the premise describes a person walking uphill from a construction zone. this indicates that the person is moving against the natural slope of the ground, requiring additional effort. the location of the construction zone is irrelevant to the reasoning. step 2: the hypothesis suggests that the person is walking down stairs. stairs are a man-made structure with steps that go downwards. the action of 'walking down stairs' is incompatible with 'walking uphill'. step 3: based on the logical inconsistency between the premise and hypothesis, the hypothesis cannot be inferred from the premise.step 3: the hypothesis contradicts the information in the premise."
4258,uh-huh you got it i,"Nope, try again.",0,0,True,"step 1: the premise does not provide sufficient information for any logical inference to be made. it is essentially a neutral statement. step 2: the hypothesis is a negative statement, indicating that the premise is incorrect or insufficient. since the premise itself does not contain any logical errors or inconsistencies, the hypothesis cannot be inferred from it. step 3: based on the logical analysis, common sense reasoning, and the lack of information in the premise to make such an inference, the hypothesis is not entailed by the premise."
4259,He's gittin' some biggety idear as how it's up t' him t' police this here town.,He's already started imposing laws on this town.,1,1,True,"step 1: in the premise, 'he's gittin' some biggety idear as how it's up t' him t' police this here town.' this sentence indicates that 'he' is considering taking responsibility for enforcing the law in the town. 'biggety idear' is a colloquial way of saying 'big idea' or 'ambitious plan'. 'it's up to him' implies that he is accepting a challenge or responsibility.step 2: in the hypothesis, 'he's already started imposing laws on this town.' this statement suggests that 'he' has taken action on his idea and has begun enforcing laws.step 3: the hypothesis can be logically inferred from the premise. while the premise does not directly state that 'he' has started enforcing laws, it does indicate that 'he' is considering taking on the responsibility of policing the town. given the natural progression of events for someone taking on such a role, it is a reasonable assumption that 'he' would begin enforcing laws after deciding to do so. this is a common sense inference based on logical reasoning and the given context.step 4: furthermore, there are no contradictory facts or information in the premise or hypothesis that would prevent the hypothesis from being inferred.step 5: based on the logical reasoning, common sense understanding, and lack of contradictory facts, the hypothesis is entailed by the premise."
4260,The Enquirer ran photographs of that couple's recent romantic and very public evening out in Los Angeles.,The couple hasn't been out lately.,0,0,True,"step 1: in the premise, it is stated that the enquirer ran photographs of a specific couple's recent romantic evening out in los angeles. this indicates that the couple was out in public and their outing was recent. step 2: the hypothesis, 'the couple hasn't been out lately', contradicts the information presented in the premise. the premise describes the couple being out, whereas the hypothesis suggests they haven't been out at all. step 3: based on the logical analysis, the hypothesis cannot be inferred from the premise as it contradicts the information provided."
4261,It was artistically corded.,I was the one who corded it.,1,0,False,"step 1: in the premise, 'it was artistically corded' describes an object that has been carefully and aesthetically arranged or decorated using cords. no specific agent is mentioned in the premise. step 2: the hypothesis 'i was the one who corded it' asserts that a particular agent, 'i', was responsible for the corded arrangement. step 3: to determine entailment, we need to find a logical connection between the premise and hypothesis. however, the premise alone does not provide enough information to infer the hypothesis. the hypothesis requires the addition of new information not present in the premise. therefore, the hypothesis is not logically entailed by the premise. step 4: it's important to note that the lack of entailment does not necessarily mean that the hypothesis is false, but rather that it cannot be logically deduced from the given premise."
4262,Unit and system operating constraints provide system-specific realism to the outputs of the model.,System realism ,1,1,True,"step 1: in the premise, 'unit and system operating constraints' are identified as factors that add realism to the model's outputs. realism, in this context, refers to the accuracy and relevance of the model's outputs to real-world systems. step 2: the hypothesis, 'system realism,' can be seen as a more general and abstract description of the concept presented in the premise. the hypothesis is a logical consequence of the premise since 'system realism' encompasses the idea that the operating constraints of a system are essential for producing accurate model outputs. step 3: based on the logical connection between the premise and hypothesis, and the fact that the hypothesis is a more abstract and general term for the concept presented in the premise, the hypothesis can be inferred from the premise."
4263,Then Acheson had looked up.,"After the loud sound, he looked up.",1,1,True,"step 1: in the premise, 'then acheson had looked up', the temporal conjunction 'then' suggests that this action of looking up by acheson followed some previous event. there is no explicit mention of a loud sound in the premise, but the hypothesis introduces this element. however, the premise does not provide any contradictory information that would rule out the presence of a loud sound before acheson looked up. step 2: the hypothesis suggests a causal relationship between the loud sound and acheson looking up. while the premise does not explicitly state this relationship, it is a common and reasonable assumption that people often look up in response to a loud sound. this inference is based on logical principles and common sense. step 3: based on the logical principles and common-sense reasoning, the hypothesis can be inferred from the premise.step 4: an alternative explanation for acheson looking up in the premise is that he might have looked up for some other reasons, unrelated to a loud sound. however, the hypothesis is not in contradiction with this possibility because the premise is ambiguous regarding the cause of acheson's action of looking up. therefore, the hypothesis is still a plausible explanation, even if not the only one.therefore, the hypothesis 'after the loud sound, he looked up' is a possible inference from the premise 'then acheson had looked up'."
4264,that's more than than the property i have right here that you've got as a uh a garden that's amazing,Your garden is tiny. ,0,0,True,"step 1: in the premise, the speaker is expressing that the property they have is less than 'that's more than' which is referred to but not specified. the speaker then goes on to describe the garden as 'amazing'. step 2: the hypothesis, 'your garden is tiny', suggests the opposite of 'amazing'. however, the term 'amazing' is subjective and does not necessarily contradict the hypothesis. in fact, a tiny garden can be described as amazing due to its charm or unique features. step 3: without further context or specific definitions of 'that's more than' or 'amazing', it is not possible to definitively infer the size of the garden from the premise. therefore, the hypothesis 'your garden is tiny' is not logically entailed by the premise.step 4: it is important to note that the premise is spoken language from a speaker and may contain colloquialisms, rhetorical devices, and nuances that can alter the meaning. the hypothesis, on the other hand, is a statement in written form and may not fully capture the speaker's intended meaning. in this case, the premise may have been an exaggeration or figure of speech, which further complicates the logical relationship between the two statements.step 5: in conclusion, without more context or clarification, it is not possible to logically infer the hypothesis from the premise."
4265,A little boy smiles while playing in the dirt.,A human smiling.,1,1,True,"step 1: in the premise, a little boy is described as smiling while playing in the dirt. this means that a human being is performing the action of smiling. step 2: the hypothesis 'a human smiling' is identical to the subject of the premise, so it can be directly inferred from the premise as it is a specific instance of the more general statement in the premise. step 3: the hypothesis is a logical entailment of the premise given that the hypothesis is a more specific version of the subject described in the premise."
4266,Personal saving percent of Household wealth to disposable disposable personal income personal income ratio,Public saving percent of Corporation wealth to necessary company income.,0,0,True,"step 1. in the premise, 'personal saving percent of household wealth to disposable disposable personal income' refers to the percentage of a household's income that is saved, relative to their disposable income. this ratio represents the portion of income that a household does not spend and sets aside for future use.'public saving percent of corporation wealth to necessary company income' in the hypothesis refers to the percentage of a corporation's wealth that is saved, relative to their necessary or required income. this ratio represents the portion of income that a corporation does not spend and sets aside for future purposes.step 2. the hypothesis cannot be logically inferred from the premise, as they discuss different entities – households and corporations – and their respective income and wealth. while both savings ratios are similar in concept, the information in the premise does not provide enough detail to make a direct inference about corporations.step 3: based on the logical analysis, no entailment exists between the premise and hypothesis."
4267,The intervention could be stopped by a block of isolationist senators and House members.,"The intervention was unstoppable, a juggernaut of political intent.",0,0,True,"step 1. in the premise, it is stated that the intervention could be stopped by certain senators and house members. this implies that the intervention is not an unstoppable force. step 2. in contrast, the hypothesis asserts that the intervention was unstoppable. this directly contradicts the information in the premise. step 3. based on the logical analysis, the hypothesis cannot be logically inferred from the premise as they are in contradiction."
4268,oh i have i've i've caught i watched that late um i guess it's on late Saturday nights or something that's on during the day as well,It is not on the TV on Saturday night.  ,0,0,True,"step 1. in the premise, the speaker mentions that they have watched a show 'late saturday nights or something' and that it is also on during the day. however, the exact name of the show or any specific details about its broadcasting schedule are not provided. step 2. the hypothesis states that the show is not on tv on saturday nights. this directly contradicts the information in the premise. step 3. based on the given information, the hypothesis cannot be inferred from the premise as it contradicts it."
4269,"Moreover, with the exception of daily evaluated time and daily pieces delivered per box, the average values of all variables change monotonically.",The amount of daily time increased ,1,1,True,"step 1: in the premise, it is stated that all variables, except for 'daily evaluated time' and 'daily pieces delivered per box', have monotonic changes in their average values. monotonic changes mean that the values either always increase or always decrease.step 2: the hypothesis suggests an increase in the 'amount of daily time'. if the average value of 'daily time' increases, it aligns with the definition of monotonic increases, as given in the premise. therefore, the hypothesis is not contradictory to the premise.step 3: based on the information provided, the hypothesis can be logically inferred from the premise, assuming that the 'amount of daily time' is one of the variables mentioned in the premise. if the 'amount of daily time' is not included among the variables mentioned, then the hypothesis cannot be logically inferred from the premise."
4270,"Our goal is to better serve our client by making GAO more responsive, more flexible - and more focused on our client.",We are trying to make GAO less flexible.,0,0,True,"step 1: in the premise, the goal is stated as making gao more responsive, more flexible, and more focused on the client. this implies an intention to improve gao's adaptability and effectiveness in serving the client. step 2: the hypothesis, however, suggests the opposite of what's stated in the premise - making gao less flexible. this is a contradiction to the information provided in the premise. step 3: based on the analysis in step 1 and step 2, the hypothesis cannot be logically inferred from the premise."
4272,"Starting out from Cavaillon, home of famously succulent cantaloupe melons, head east to the Lub??ron mountains, the heart of the Provencal countryside and now a protected regional park.",Lub is a popular tourist destination due to it's lush forests.,1,1,True,"step 1: in the premise, cavaillon is identified as the home of cantaloupe melons and the starting point. the destination is then described as the luberon mountains, which is now a protected regional park in the provencal countryside. no contradictory information is given. step 2: the hypothesis suggests that the luberon region is popular among tourists due to its lush forests. the premise does not directly mention tourists or the lushness of the forests, but it is common sense and a reasonable assumption that a protected regional park, especially in a countryside setting, would attract tourists. furthermore, lush forests are a typical feature that can make a destination appealing to tourists. step 3: based on the logical reasoning, common sense, and the lack of contradictory information, the hypothesis can be inferred from the premise as it provides a reasonable and likely explanation for the given context."
4273,"Still, Willey's story has serious problems, quite apart from Steele, as a recent, endless analysis in The Nation makes clear.","Willey really enjoys telling stories, but not when they have problems",1,0,False,"step 1: in the premise, it is stated that willey's story has serious problems and this fact is pointed out in a recent analysis in the nation. no information is given about willey's feelings or motivations regarding storytelling.step 2: the hypothesis suggests an opposite interpretation of willey's feelings towards storytelling, stating that he really enjoys telling stories, despite problems with them.step 3: it is not logical or entailed that willey enjoys telling stories based on the premise. the premise only states that willey's stories have problems and that this fact is widely acknowledged. the hypothesis is not a necessary or reasonable conclusion based on the information provided in the premise.step 4: thus, the hypothesis is not logically entailed by the premise."
4274,Here we have a guy using a pressure washer on the sidewalk.,A guy is washing the sidewalk.,1,1,True,"step 1: in the premise, it is stated that 'here we have a guy using a pressure washer on the sidewalk'. this indicates that a guy is performing an action (using a pressure washer) on the sidewalk. step 2: the hypothesis 'a guy is washing the sidewalk' directly follows the premise since 'washing' is a type of 'using a pressure washer' and the object of both actions is 'the sidewalk'. step 3: given that there is a clear semantic relationship between the premise and hypothesis, and no contradictory information, the hypothesis can be logically inferred from the premise."
4275,"It was a quite good idea too, and the next SMS ('All at cart by unintentionally only honest lamb') convinced him it was the best idea of his life.",The idea he had about what to have for dinner was awesome. ,1,1,True,"step 1: in the premise, it is mentioned that the idea was quite good and then later it is stated that the person was convinced it was the best idea of his life after receiving an sms. this implies that the idea was initially good and then later confirmed to be excellent. the hypothesis suggests that the idea for dinner was awesome, which aligns with the premise's description of the idea's goodness. no contradictory facts or logical inconsistencies are present in either the premise or hypothesis.step 2: the hypothesis 'the idea he had about what to have for dinner was awesome' is a stronger statement than the premise 'it was a quite good idea too'. however, the hypothesis can be inferred from the premise as the premise's description of the idea's goodness implies that it could be considered awesome.step 3: based on the logical reasoning and common sense, the hypothesis can be inferred from the premise."
4276,There's nothing left.,Everything had been completely destroyed.,1,1,True,"step 1: in the premise, 'nothing left' signifies an absence or completeness of something, which could be applied to various contexts such as physical objects or abstract concepts. no specific information is given about what was once present or how it came to be 'nothing'. in the hypothesis, 'everything' refers to the totality of what was previously existent. step 2: given that 'nothing left' implies the absence or destruction of all things involved in the context, 'everything had been completely destroyed' can be logically inferred from the premise. this inference is based on the assumption that the absence of something implies its previous existence and destruction, which is a common logical principle. step 3: the hypothesis is a logical entailment of the premise, as it provides a more detailed and complete description of the state described in the premise."
4278,"With funding from the Lawyers Trust Fund of Illinois, the Technology Working Group and representatives from CARPLS (the Chicago-based hotline and referral services), Legal Assistance Foundation of Metropolitan Chicago, Prairie State Legal Services and Land of Lincoln Legal Assistance Foundation have formed a Best Practices group.",The Lawyers Trust Fund of Illinois gives no funding to the Technology Working Group.,0,0,True,"step 1: in the premise, it is stated that the technology working group and other organizations have formed a best practices group with funding from the lawyers trust fund of illinois. this indicates a financial relationship between the lawyers trust fund and the technology working group. step 2: the hypothesis states that the lawyers trust fund gives no funding to the technology working group. this directly contradicts the information in the premise, as the premise explicitly states that the lawyers trust fund provides funding. step 3: based on the logical negation of the information in the premise, the hypothesis is not entailed by the premise, and in fact, the hypothesis contradicts the premise."
4279,yeah that kind of a deal as opposed to to uh you know having shooting giant cannons and all the kind of warfare that kids are playing with today you know they turn the stick into a cannon instead of a simple little gun,Kids play with big artillery instead of the guns we played with.,1,0,False,"step 1: in the premise, the speaker compares the toys kids used to play with in the past (sticks turned into guns) to the toys they don't play with anymore (big artillery). this implies that the toys kids used to play with were simpler and smaller than the toys they play with now. step 2: the hypothesis suggests that kids play with big artillery, which is the opposite of what the speaker mentioned in the premise about the toys kids used to play with. however, there is no clear contradiction between the premise and the hypothesis, as the premise does not state that kids do not play with big artillery at all. step 3: based on the given information, the hypothesis cannot be logically inferred from the premise, as the premise does not provide enough detail about the current toys kids play with to make such a conclusion. the hypothesis goes beyond the information provided in the premise."
4281,"While the mob was running the casinos, promoters were busily selling Las Vegas as a glamorous Hollywood in the desert.",The mob was not in Vegas yet.,0,0,True,"step 1: in the premise, 'the mob was running the casinos' implies the presence and control of the mob in las vegas. 'promoters were busily selling las vegas as a glamorous hollywood in the desert' suggests an effort to attract tourists and investors to the city. it is factually inconsistent for the mob to be running the casinos and not be present in vegas at the same time.step 2: the hypothesis 'the mob was not in vegas yet' contradicts the premise 'while the mob was running the casinos'. the hypothesis cannot be logically inferred from the premise as it goes against the information provided.step 3: based on the logical analysis, the hypothesis 'the mob was not in vegas yet' is not entailed by the premise."
4282,"It's perfectly sweet of you, she said, ""but you know you don't want to!""",It's rather rude of you. ,0,0,True,"step 1: the premise is a quote from a conversation where someone is expressing their opinion about an action as being sweet but acknowledges that the person being addressed might not want to do it. it does not provide any explicit information about the nature of the action or the context. step 2: the hypothesis implies that the action being discussed is rude. there is no direct connection between the premise and the hypothesis. the opinion expressed in the premise does not logically lead to the hypothesis. step 3: based on the given information, the hypothesis cannot be inferred from the premise as there is no logical connection or sufficient context provided to make such an inference."
4283,"A worried blond-haired baby is sitting inside a large, shiny metal cooking pot that is on top of an electric stove.",A baby in his stroller outside.,0,0,True,"step 1: in the premise, a worried blond-haired baby is described as being inside a large, shiny metal cooking pot that is on top of an electric stove. this information suggests an unusual and dangerous situation, as a baby should not be in a cooking pot. the premise does not provide any additional context about why the baby is in the pot or how it got there. step 2: the hypothesis describes a completely different situation, where a baby is in a stroller outside. there is no logical connection or relationship between the premise and hypothesis. the hypothesis cannot be inferred from the premise based on the information provided. step 3: based on the given information, there is no entailment relationship between the premise and hypothesis."
4285,"In his crime bill, passed in 1994, he went further than any Republican president would have dared to restrict habeas corpus, the writ by which state prisoners, including those on death row, can get their cases reviewed by federal courts.",The man who was president in 1994 was all for liberal rights for all prisoners.,0,1,False,"step 1: in the premise, it is stated that the man who was president in 1994 went further than any republican president in restricting habeas corpus for state prisoners, including those on death row. this indicates that the president took a more liberal stance on prisoners' rights regarding habeas corpus than what is typically expected from a republican president. step 2: the hypothesis suggests that the man who was president in 1994 was 'all for liberal rights for all prisoners.' this can be inferred from the premise because the premise already establishes that the president was more liberal in his stance on prisoners' habeas corpus rights than what is generally expected from a republican president. thus, the hypothesis is a stronger statement than what is stated in the premise, but it is still logically consistent with it. step 3: based on the logical reasoning and the given information, the hypothesis can be inferred from the premise as it is a logical consequence of the premise."
4286,yeah i think the the team i like rooting for the best which i don't i don't know if they really are the,My favorite team may not be the best. ,1,0,False,"step 1: in the premise, the speaker expresses their preference for a particular team and acknowledges that they are unsure if this team is actually the best. this indicates a subjective opinion and a degree of uncertainty.step 2: the hypothesis suggests a possibility that contradicts the speaker's stated preference – that their favorite team might not be the best. this contradiction does not logically follow from the premise, as the premise does not establish the truthfulness or superiority of the favorite team.step 3: based on the given information, the hypothesis is not entailed by the premise, as the hypothesis presents a contradictory statement to the speaker's expressed preference.label: 0"
4287,to remain biological they uh women are because they have choice are having children much later in life,Women have to have their children early in life and not wait.,0,0,True,"step 1: in the premise, it is stated that women are having children much later in life 'to remain biological.' this implies that there is a connection between a woman's age and her ability to have children. however, the premise also mentions that women 'have choice' in the matter. thus, the statement suggests a shift from biological constraints to personal choice.step 2: the hypothesis states that women 'have to have their children early in life and not wait.' this directly contradicts the premise, as the premise indicates that women are indeed choosing to have children later in life.step 3: based on the given information and logical principles, the hypothesis is not entailed by the premise as it contradicts the stated facts."
4288,to their success in building successful information-sharing relationships with and among their members.,The failure to build a successful info-sharing system was the downfall of their members. ,0,0,True,"step 1: in the premise, the success of information-sharing relationships among members is emphasized. the success of these relationships is a positive outcome.step 2: in the hypothesis, the failure to build a successful info-sharing system is suggested as a negative outcome leading to the downfall of members.step 3: the hypothesis contradicts the premise, as the premise states the success of info-sharing relationships, while the hypothesis posits their failure as causing a downfall.step 4: logically, the premise and hypothesis cannot both be true, as they present contradictory outcomes.step 5: based on the logical reasoning, the hypothesis is not entailed by the premise, and they are inconsistent with each other."
4289,All I have to do is let this train reach its third stop.',The train has to go to the seventh stop.,0,0,True,"step 1. in the premise, 'this train' is going to reach its third stop. the information does not provide any details about the total number of stops the train has, their sequence, or the identity of the train. the premise only states that the train will reach its third stop. step 2. the hypothesis 'the train has to go to the seventh stop' cannot be logically inferred from the premise. the premise does not provide any information about the sequence of stops beyond the third one. it is possible that the train stops at the third stop and then turns around or continues to other stops. the hypothesis is not entailed by the premise, as it introduces new information. step 3. based on the given information, the hypothesis is not entailed by the premise."
4290,'Greetings!',They said goodbye.,0,0,True,"step 1: in the premise, there is a simple and friendly greeting. the premise does not contain any explicit or implicit information about the speaker's intention to say goodbye or about the conversation's context. there is no factual inconsistency or logical connection between the premise and hypothesis.step 2: the hypothesis, 'they said goodbye,' is the opposite of the greeting given in the premise. a greeting is an expression meant to initiate or continue a conversation, whereas saying goodbye is an expression used to conclude or end a conversation. the hypothesis cannot be logically inferred from the premise as it contradicts the information provided in the premise.step 3: based on the logical analysis and the contradictory nature of the hypothesis with respect to the premise, the hypothesis is not entailed by the premise."
4291,of course charged those puppies up and it's oh boy when those bills start coming in they want a lot of money when you start getting them up there,they expect a lot of money from you when the electric bills start arriving,1,1,True,"step 1: in the premise, 'of course charged those puppies' is likely a colloquial expression meaning 'had a lot of expenses' or 'incurred significant costs' in relation to raising or taking care of 'them puppies'. 'up' in this context could mean an increase or a rising situation. the subsequent part of the premise 'oh boy when those bills start coming in they want a lot of money' indicates that there are significant financial costs involved.step 2: the hypothesis 'they expect a lot of money from you when the electric bills start arriving' is logically related to the premise. the 'bills' mentioned in the hypothesis can be reasonably assumed to be the electric bills, as they are the bills mentioned in the premise that are expected to cause significant financial costs.step 3: based on the logical connection between the premise and hypothesis, common sense reasoning, and the absence of contradictory information, the hypothesis can be logically inferred from the premise."
4292,"One of my first actions was to ring up the hospital where she was working.""",I sat on my hands and did not take action.,0,0,True,"step 1: in the premise, 'one of my first actions was to ring up the hospital where she was working', the speaker is describing an action they took in response to a situation. the action is not consistent with 'sitting on my hands and doing nothing'. step 2: the hypothesis is clearly contradictory to the premise as it states that no action was taken, while the premise states that a specific action was taken. step 3: based on the information presented, the hypothesis is not entailed by the premise as they are logically contradictory."
4293,Some had microphones; some had notepads.,They were all looking for a note pad or a microphone. ,0,0,True,"step 1: in the premise, it is stated that some people had microphones and some had notepads. this implies a group of individuals, each with different tools. there is no information provided about what they were doing with these tools or why they had them. step 2: the hypothesis suggests that all individuals were looking for a notepad or a microphone. this is not directly inferred from the premise, as there is no mention of them searching for these items. step 3: based on the given information, the hypothesis cannot be logically inferred from the premise."
4294,"Currently, the majority of the group members are attending graduating college.","Currently, the majority of the group members are attending or just graduating college.",1,1,True,"step 1: in the premise, 'the majority of the group members are attending graduating college' implies that most members are either currently enrolled in college or in the process of graduating. the phrase 'attending graduating' is a common colloquialism that refers to the transition from being an active student (attending college) to completing one's studies (graduating).step 2: the hypothesis, 'currently, the majority of the group members are attending or just graduating college', is identical to the premise with the addition of the conjunction 'or'. this modification does not change the meaning significantly, as 'attending college' and 'just graduating college' are closely related concepts in this context.step 3: based on the logical equivalence of the premise and hypothesis, and the lack of contradictory information, the hypothesis can be inferred from the premise."
4295,"Using the hypothetical data in table II.I, identify states for each type of purposive selection that we might consider.",The table shows  for each type of selection we could consider.,1,0,False,"step 1. analyzing the premise, it is asking to identify states for each type of purposive selection using the data in table ii.i. however, the premise does not provide any specific information about the types of purposive selection or the states in question. it only mentions that we should identify these based on the data in the table.step 2. the hypothesis, on the other hand, suggests that the table shows the states for each type of selection. however, there is no way to logically infer this from the premise as the premise does not mention anything about the table providing the states for each type of selection.step 3. based on the information provided, the hypothesis is not entailed by the premise. the premise only asks to identify states based on the data in the table, and the hypothesis goes beyond that by stating that the table already provides the states. without further context or information, it is impossible to infer this from the premise alone."
4296,This chilling story of a mother's crushing love for a son will haunt me long after I've forgotten the details of the handover ceremony.,This story will always make me cry when I remember it.,1,1,True,"step 1: the premise describes a chilling story about a mother's intense love for her son, and the fact that the details of the handover ceremony have been forgotten indicates that the story's emotional impact has remained. step 2: the hypothesis suggests that the story will make the reader cry whenever it is remembered. this emotional response can be considered a natural consequence of the 'crushing love' described in the premise. step 3: based on the logical connection between strong emotions and the tendency to evoke tears, the hypothesis can be inferred from the premise. step 4: common sense also supports the inference, as strong emotions like a mother's love often lead to tears.step 5: the hypothesis does not contradict the premise in any way, as the hypothesis only adds an additional detail about the emotional impact of the story.therefore, the hypothesis is a logical inference from the premise."
4297,"'C-C-C-..C...Computer O-O-Online,' came a croaking voice from one of the consoles.",The computer was equiped with an old voice module that told me it was online.,1,1,True,"step 1: in the premise, the sentence 'c-c-c-..c...computer o-o-online,' came a croaking voice from one of the consoles, describes a computer reporting that it is online using an old-fashioned, croaking voice. this voice output is a common feature of older or outdated voice modules.step 2: the hypothesis, the computer was equipped with an old voice module that told me it was online, is consistent with the premise. the hypothesis is a reasonable inference from the premise because the premise implies that the voice coming from the console is from an old voice module, and the hypothesis expands on this detail. the hypothesis does not contradict any information in the premise, and it adds to our understanding of the scene described.step 3: based on the logical relationship between the premise and hypothesis, and the lack of contradictory information, the hypothesis is a logical inference from the premise. the hypothesis provides additional details that are consistent with the information given in the premise."
4298,One couple we definitely don't expect to see reconciling anytime soon is Cybill Shepherd and her former fiance Robert Martin.,Shepherd and Martin will most likely make up soon.,0,0,True,"step 1: in the premise, cybill shepherd and robert martin are identified as a couple with a strained relationship, and it is stated that their reconciliation is not expected. no specific information is provided about the reasons for their breakup or any recent developments that might indicate a potential reconciliation.step 2: the hypothesis, on the other hand, states that shepherd and martin are 'most likely' to make up soon. this contradicts the premise, as the premise explicitly states that their reconciliation is not expected.step 3: based on the given information, there is no logical or factual basis for the hypothesis. the premise and hypothesis present contradictory statements about the same situation.step 4: given that the hypothesis contradicts the premise, it cannot be logically inferred from the premise."
4299," ""And I say once again, Captain, that men who ride for me do not in addition ride for Kitchell.""","""I promise you that my men are loyal to me and no one else.""",1,1,True,"step 1. in the premise, the speaker asserts that his men do not ride for kitchell, emphasizing their loyalty to him. this statement implies that the speaker has control over his men and they are not divided in their allegiance.step 2. the hypothesis asserts that the speaker's men are loyal to him and no one else. this statement is consistent with the premise, as both assert the same thing - that the men are loyal to the speaker only.step 3. the hypothesis can be inferred from the premise because the premise implies the loyalty of the speaker's men, and the hypothesis simply states this fact explicitly.step 4. it is also important to note that there is no contradictory information in either the premise or hypothesis that would prevent the hypothesis from being logically inferred from the premise.therefore, based on logical reasoning, the lack of contradictory information, and common sense, the hypothesis is entailed by the premise."
4300,"Despite huge projected increases in food production, per capita food consumption in South Asia, the Middle East, and the less-developed nations of Africa will scarcely improve or will actually decline below present inadequate levels.",Some Africans will starve and others will flourish.,1,0,False,"step 1: the premise states that per capita food consumption in south asia, the middle east, and the less-developed nations of africa will scarcely improve or even decline, despite projected food production increases. this implies a situation of food scarcity or inadequacy for many people in these regions.step 2: the hypothesis suggests a contrasting scenario where some africans will starve (experience food scarcity) and others will flourish (have ample food). this hypothesis is not logically contradictory to the premise, as the premise does not state that every individual in these regions will experience the same food situation.step 3: while the premise indicates a general trend of food scarcity, it does not necessarily entail that some individuals will starve. however, the hypothesis is a reasonable inference from the premise because food scarcity often leads to situations where some individuals face starvation while others have access to enough food. this inference is based on common sense, logical principles, and factual consistency with historical and current situations in these regions.step 4: in conclusion, the hypothesis is not logically entailed by the premise but is a reasonable inference based on common sense and the logical connection between food scarcity and individual food access."
4301,and it's kind of almost expected of you anyway people kind of look down on on a you know the role of a woman as a housewife it's kind of like oh well you know she didn't go to college and she's just a housewife and that's all she does right,People are really mean to women who choose to stay home instead of going to work.,1,1,True,"step 1: in the premise, there is a description of societal expectations and attitudes towards women who choose to be housewives. the speaker mentions that people look down on this role and often make derogatory comments. step 2: the hypothesis directly relates to the premise as it also expresses the negative treatment of women who choose to stay at home. the hypothesis can be logically inferred from the premise as the premise sets up the context for the behavior described in the hypothesis. step 3: based on the logical connection between the premise and hypothesis, common sense understanding of societal attitudes, and the lack of contradictory information, the hypothesis is entailed by the premise."
4302,"Planning and organizing for this final merger has been extensive, and a merger website at www.wvlegalservicesmerger.org helps facilitate the process.",The planning for the merger was swift and easy. ,0,0,True,"step 1: in the premise, the extent of planning and organizing for the merger is emphasized. the existence of a merger website is mentioned as a facilitator for the process. no information in the premise suggests that the planning was swift and easy. in fact, the use of the term 'extensive' implies significant time and effort.step 2: the hypothesis contradicts the premise, as it states that the planning was swift and easy whereas the premise indicates the opposite.step 3: based on the logical analysis, the hypothesis cannot be inferred from the premise."
4303,uh probably about first grade,Probably about third grade. ,1,1,True,"step 1: both the premise and hypothesis are describing approximate grades in school. the difference between first and third grade is two grades. step 2: the hypothesis can be inferred from the premise as it is a logical progression of one grade level higher. step 3: based on the given information and logical principles, the hypothesis can be inferred from the premise."
4304,"I know the smell of fear and blood as you do, my friend, and I still miss it.",I dream of the smell of blood every night.,1,0,False,"step 1: in the premise, the speaker compares their personal experience of recognizing the smells of fear and blood with that of a friend. this suggests a strong emotional connection to these smells. step 2: the hypothesis describes a dream where the speaker experiences the smell of blood. dreaming is an experience that involves the mind and senses, and it is common for people to have vivid and emotional dreams. step 3: the hypothesis can be inferred from the premise, as the speaker's strong emotional connection to the smells of fear and blood could potentially manifest in dreams, especially given the use of the word 'still' which implies an ongoing attachment or longing for these smells. step 4: it's important to note that while the hypothesis can be inferred from the premise, it doesn't necessarily mean that it is a fact. dreams are subjective experiences and their meaning can vary from person to person. therefore, the hypothesis is an inference but not an entailment."
4305,"In making these decisions, Congress should consider the criteria presented earlier in my testimony, especially those related to agency transitions, such as mission relevancy, similar goals and objectives, leveraging effectiveness, and creating gains through consolidation.",I testified that consolidation was the best way to create gains.,1,1,True,"step 1: in the premise, the speaker mentions that congress should consider certain criteria related to agency transitions. these criteria include mission relevancy, similar goals and objectives, leveraging effectiveness, and creating gains through consolidation. the speaker emphasizes the importance of considering these criteria 'especially those related to consolidation.' step 2: the hypothesis directly aligns with the speaker's emphasis on consolidation as a way to create gains. the hypothesis can be logically inferred as an expected or implied outcome of the speaker's testimony, given the context provided. step 3: based on the logical connection between the premise and hypothesis, and the emphasis placed on consolidation in the premise, the hypothesis can be inferred from the premise."
4306,"On your way through the Italian rooms, be sure to keep an eye peeled for Fra Angelico's glowing and stupendous Annunciation, as well as for Antonello da Messina's realistically detailed, intensely tragic Christ Sustained by an Angel, and Sandro Botticelli's The Story of Nastagio Degli Onesti.","You don't have to be careful when going through the Italian rooms, there's not much to see there.",0,0,True,"step 1: in the premise, the speaker explicitly mentions several specific pieces of art to look out for while going through the italian rooms. this implies that there is valuable art in the italian rooms worth paying attention to. step 2: the hypothesis states that there's not much to see there and that caution is not required. this contradicts the information provided in the premise. step 3: based on the information in the premise and the logical negation of the hypothesis, it can be inferred that the hypothesis is not entailed by the premise."
4307,The Alps of Savoie and the Dauphin?? peter out in the rugged little Alpilles of Provence.,These Alps are some of the lesser known ones in the world.,1,1,True,"step 1: in the premise, the alps of savoie and the dauphin are identified as 'petering out' in the alpilles of provence. this means that these alps gradually lose their height and prominence as they reach the alpilles. it is common knowledge that the alps are a major mountain range in europe, but there are indeed lesser-known alpine ranges. step 2: the hypothesis suggests that these particular alps are among the lesser-known ones in the world. given that the alps of savoie and the dauphin are described as 'petering out' in the premise, it is a reasonable inference that they are not as well-known or prominent as other parts of the alps. step 3: based on the logical connection between the premise and hypothesis, common sense understanding, and the lack of contradictory facts, the hypothesis can be inferred from the premise."
4308,"The NEPDG carried out many activities, the results of which are subject to evaluation by GAO under the plain meaning of the statute.",NEPDG committed illegal activities.,1,0,False,"step 1: the premise states that the nepdg carried out activities, and these activities are subject to evaluation by the gao under the plain meaning of the statute. this implies that the nepdg's activities are within the scope of the statute and are not necessarily illegal. common sense and factual consistency suggest that the hypothesis does not contradict the premise.step 2: the hypothesis, 'nepdg committed illegal activities,' is not logically entailed by the premise, 'the nepdg carried out many activities, the results of which are subject to evaluation by gao under the plain meaning of the statute.' the premise only indicates that the gao has the authority to evaluate the activities, it does not provide evidence or information that these activities were illegal.step 3: based on the logical analysis and the lack of contradictory information, the hypothesis 'nepdg committed illegal activities' is not entailed by the premise."
4309,"These films include core elements of science fiction, but can cross into other genres.","These films include core elements of science fiction, but can cross into identical genres.",0,0,True,"step 1: the premise states that these films include core elements of science fiction but can cross into other genres. this implies that science fiction is a primary genre, and other genres are secondary. it is a fact that science fiction can incorporate elements from other genres, and there are numerous examples of films that fit this description. step 2: the hypothesis suggests that these films can cross into identical genres, which appears to be a redundant statement given the information in the premise. however, it is possible that the hypothesis intends to emphasize the extent of genre blending or the absence of distinct genre boundaries in these films. step 3: while the hypothesis does not directly contradict the premise, it does not logically follow from it either. the premise describes a relationship between science fiction and other genres, while the hypothesis introduces an additional condition (identical genres) without clear justification or logical connection. step 4: given the ambiguity and potential redundancy in the hypothesis, it would be prudent to consider the context and intent of the statement before determining entailment. in the absence of clear evidence or logical necessity, it is difficult to conclude that the hypothesis is entailed by the premise."
4310,"Did you notice if that was bolted too?"" Annie hesitated. ",Annie didn't hesitate.,0,0,True,"step 1: the premise describes a situation where annie hesitated. this means she showed signs of uncertainty or doubt. hesitation is a common human behavior and is not inherently contradictory to any logical principle.step 2: the hypothesis suggests that annie did not hesitate, which is the opposite of what is stated in the premise.step 3: based on the given information, the hypothesis cannot be logically inferred from the premise because they make contradictory claims about annie's behavior.step 4: it's important to note that the absence of hesitation, as stated in the hypothesis, is not equivalent to the presence of certainty or confidence in annie's actions or words. the hypothesis does not provide enough information to logically infer that annie acted or spoke with confidence.therefore, the hypothesis is not entailed by the premise."
4311,um-hum you you don't think that they went and did a uh what is it an Ishihara uh quality analysis,"You don't think they did a quality analysis over Christmas break, do you? ",1,1,True,"step 1: in the premise, 'they' are mentioned as not having done an ishihara quality analysis. the ishihara test is a type of quality analysis used in various fields, including vision screening. 'over christmas break' refers to a specific time period. step 2: the hypothesis also refers to 'they' not having done a quality analysis, but it does not mention the ishihara test specifically. however, the premise provides no information contradicting the hypothesis. the hypothesis can be seen as a more general version of the premise. step 3: based on the similarity of the subjects and the lack of contradictory information, the hypothesis can be inferred from the premise. both statements are saying that 'they' did not perform a quality analysis during the specified time period, just the ishihara test is not explicitly mentioned in the hypothesis.step 4: it is important to note that while the hypothesis can be logically inferred from the premise, without additional context, it is unclear if the ishihara test was the only quality analysis that 'they' were expected or required to perform during the christmas break."
4312,This is the image of two Asian men squatting near a mop-pad.,Two italian girls are squatting.,0,0,True,"step 1: in the premise, we have a description of two asian men performing an action (squatting) near a mop-pad. the description is limited to the people involved and their action. no specific information about their nationality being italian is provided. common sense and factual knowledge tell us that squatting is a universal behavior and is not exclusive to any particular ethnicity or nationality.step 2: the hypothesis suggests a different scenario involving two italian girls. however, the premise does not provide any information that would logically lead to this conclusion. the hypothesis contradicts the premise because the description of the people in the premise as asian men is inconsistent with the hypothesis of italian girls.step 3: based on the logical reasoning, common sense, and the contradiction between the premise and hypothesis, the hypothesis is not entailed by the premise."
4313,"He was the father of Chris Evert, who was one of the world 's top women tennis players in the 1970s.","He was the father of Chris Evert, who was one of the world's top women tennis players in the 1970s and 1980s.",1,1,True,"step 1: the premise establishes that the subject is the father of chris evert, who was one of the world's top women tennis players in the 1970s. the hypothesis adds no new information about the father but extends the timeframe of chris evert's successful tennis career to include the 1980s. step 2: since the hypothesis does not contradict the premise and only adds a fact that is already known or could have been inferred (given that chris evert's career spanned both decades), it can be logically inferred from the premise. step 3: based on the logical reasoning and the absence of contradictory information, the hypothesis is entailed by the premise."
4314,The SEC expects the rule will cause the costs associated with offerings to decrease significantly and also decrease the costs of distributions.,The SEC has confirmed that the rule will raise the costs by 10%.,0,0,True,"step 1: in the premise, the sec expresses their expectation that the rule will decrease the costs significantly for offerings and distributions. this implies that the sec anticipates a net cost reduction.step 2: the hypothesis, however, states that the rule will raise the costs by 10%, which contradicts the premise's expectation of a cost decrease. the hypothesis suggests a net cost increase, making it incompatible with the premise.step 3: based on the logical inconsistency between the premise and hypothesis, the hypothesis cannot be logically inferred from the premise. the hypothesis presents a contradictory scenario.step 4: inconsistent or contradictory hypotheses cannot be logically inferred from their premises, and the hypothesis presented contradicts the premise's key information and the sec's stated expectation."
4315,"For example, in 1999, even though personal saving was less than $150 billion, households' wealth still grew by $5.","Even though personal saving was less than $150 billion, the household wealth still grew because their real estate holdings appreciated.",1,1,True,"step 1: in the premise, we have the information that in 1999, personal saving was less than $150 billion, but households' wealth still grew by $5 trillion. this indicates that there was another significant contributor to the growth of households' wealth besides their savings. step 2: the hypothesis suggests an alternative explanation for the growth of households' wealth, stating that it was due to an appreciation in their real estate holdings. this explanation is reasonable based on the information given in the premise, as real estate holdings can significantly contribute to a household's wealth. step 3: given that the hypothesis provides a plausible explanation for the growth of households' wealth that is consistent with the information in the premise, it can be inferred that the hypothesis is entailed by the premise.step 4: it is important to note that the premise does not directly mention real estate, but the hypothesis does not contradict the premise. in fact, the hypothesis provides a probable explanation for the growth of households' wealth when personal saving was low.therefore, the hypothesis is a valid inference from the premise."
4316,"That is what rat choice teaches, and nobody has yet proved it wrong--even in theory.",Over 1100 people have tried to prove that rat choice teachings is wrong.,1,0,False,"step 1: in the premise, it is stated that 'that is what rat choice teaches' and that no one has yet proved it wrong, even in theory. this suggests that rat choice teachings is a belief or theory that has not been disproven. the hypothesis introduces a new piece of information claiming that over 1100 people have tried to prove it wrong.step 2: the hypothesis does not logically follow from the premise. while there might be attempts to disprove rat choice teachings, the premise does not provide any information about the number of people who have attempted to do so. the hypothesis introduces new information not suggested by the premise.step 3: based on the logical analysis, the hypothesis is not entailed by the premise."
4317,"The film was selected as the Hungarian entry for the Best Foreign Language Film at the 44th Academy Awards, but was not accepted as a nominee.","The film was selected as the Hungarian entry for the Best Foreign Language Film at the 44t5 Academy Awards, but was not accepted as a nominee.",0,0,True,"step 1: in the premise, it is stated that the film was the hungarian entry for the best foreign language film at the 44th academy awards, but it was not accepted as a nominee. this means that the film was submitted for consideration in the 44th academy awards and did not make it to the nominees' list. the hypothesis is similar to the premise, except that it changes the specific year from '44th' to '44t5'. however, the premise does not provide any information about the reason for the film not being nominated or the specific year.step 2: the hypothesis does not contradict the premise, as both sentences describe the same situation (the film being selected and not nominated). however, since the hypothesis does not logically follow from the premise (as it introduces a new detail, the specific year), it cannot be considered a logical entailment.step 3: logically, there is no way to determine if a film was selected as the hungarian entry for the best foreign language film at the 44t5 academy awards based on the information provided in the premise. therefore, the hypothesis cannot be logically inferred from the premise.your final answer:{'thought_process': "
4318,The following table summarizes the details on the size and structure of the organizations' information security staffs.,The table summarizes hundreds of pages of information altogether.,1,1,True,"step 1: the premise describes a table that summarizes the details on the size and structure of organizations' information security staffs. it does not provide any information about the length or number of pages the table represents. however, the term 'summarizes' implies that the table condenses and presents information from a larger source in a more succinct form. common sense and logical reasoning suggest that a table capable of summarizing detailed information on multiple organizations would likely contain a significant amount of information, potentially hundreds of pages. step 2: the hypothesis 'the table summarizes hundreds of pages of information altogether' is consistent with the information given in the premise. the hypothesis can be inferred from the premise because the premise states that the table summarizes the information, and it is reasonable to assume that a comprehensive summary of such detailed information would span multiple pages. step 3: based on the logical reasoning and common sense, the hypothesis can be inferred from the premise."
4319,"You will discover a medieval world updated by the varied exotica of smoky Greek barbecues, Tunisian pastry shops, and art-house cinemas.","Cinemas are an outdated thing to this area, they know that everyone watches on TV so they don't have any cinemas.",0,0,True,"step 1: in the premise, we have a description of a medieval world that has been updated with various exotic elements including smoky greek barbecues, tunisian pastry shops, and art-house cinemas. the presence of these modern elements in a medieval setting suggests that the society is still evolving and adapting to new influences. common sense tells us that cinemas are a form of entertainment that has been around for a long time and continues to exist in many parts of the world. step 2: the hypothesis, however, states that cinemas are outdated and that everyone watches tv instead. this contradicts the premise, as the presence of art-house cinemas in the medieval world suggests that cinemas are still in use. step 3: based on the logical reasoning and the contradiction between the hypothesis and the premise, the hypothesis cannot be inferred from the premise."
4320," ""The risings are almost due, Bork,"" he said.","""Don't worry about the risings, Bork, you've got plenty of time,"" He said.",0,0,True,"step 1: the premise is stating that the 'risings' are almost due for someone named bork. the term 'risings' is not explicitly defined in the context provided, but it could refer to various things such as tides, sunrise, or some other event. however, without additional context or definition, it is not possible to determine the exact meaning of 'risings' and its implications. step 2: the hypothesis is stating that bork has plenty of time concerning the 'risings'. this statement contradicts the premise if we assume that 'risings' refers to a time-sensitive event with imminent occurrence. however, if 'risings' refers to an event with a more flexible or non-urgent timeline, then the hypothesis might not contradict the premise. step 3: without sufficient information to determine the meaning of 'risings' and its implications, it is not possible to definitively say whether the hypothesis can be inferred from the premise or not. the inconsistency between the two statements only arises when we make assumptions about the meaning of 'risings'. in the absence of clear context or definition, the hypothesis cannot be logically inferred from the premise."
4321,"The original Winnie-the-Pooh was the mascot of a Canadian regiment, an actual living bear named for the city of Winnipeg.",The original Winnie-The-Pooh was inspired by actual things that happened in Winnipeg (in addition to the mascot).,1,1,True,"step 1: the premise establishes that winnie-the-pooh had its origins in a real-life bear and a mascot for a canadian regiment named after winnipeg. step 2: the hypothesis suggests that the creation of winnie-the-pooh might have been inspired by other experiences or events in winnipeg. this is a reasonable assumption, as the naming of the mascot and the creation of the popular literary character are closely linked. step 3: given the information in the premise, it is plausible that the hypothesis is true. in fact, it is well-known that author a.a. milne was inspired by his experiences in winnipeg and the real-life bear that would later become the inspiration for winnie-the-pooh. thus, the hypothesis can be inferred from the premise. step 4: the hypothesis is a specific instance of the broader idea presented in the premise, making it a more detailed or refined version of the premise's information.step 5: the hypothesis can be seen as an expansion or elaboration of the premise, as it explores the potential sources of inspiration for winnie-the-pooh beyond just the mascot.step 6: the hypothesis does not contradict the premise in any way, and the information in the hypothesis can be reasonably derived from the information in the premise.therefore, the hypothesis is entailed by the premise."
4322,Researchers do not agree on whether baby boomers and other workers are saving enough for their retirement.,Most baby boomers have pensions that will help with retirement.,1,0,False,"step 1: in the premise, it is stated that there is disagreement among researchers regarding the retirement savings of baby boomers and other workers. this implies that the amount saved by baby boomers is uncertain and a topic of debate. step 2: the hypothesis suggests that most baby boomers have pensions which could help them during retirement. having a pension does not necessarily mean that someone is saving enough for retirement, but it is an additional source of income. step 3: contrary to the premise, the hypothesis does not logically follow as it does not address the retirement savings of baby boomers directly. the existence of pensions for most baby boomers does not guarantee that they are saving enough for retirement or that they will not need additional savings. therefore, the hypothesis is not entailed by the premise.step 4: it's important to note that the premise and hypothesis deal with different aspects of the retirement situation for baby boomers. the premise discusses the debate surrounding their retirement savings, and the hypothesis states that most baby boomers have pensions. these statements do not directly contradict each other but address different aspects of the retirement scenario.step 5: in summary, the hypothesis is not logically inferred from the premise as it does not follow from the information provided in the premise, and they address different aspects of the retirement situation for baby boomers."
4323,The court ordered Moore to advertise the verdict in newspapers in 22 cities.,Moore has never received an order from a court. ,0,0,True,"step 1: the premise states that a court ordered moore to advertise a verdict in newspapers in 22 cities. this implies that moore is the subject of a legal proceeding and that he is required to take a specific action. there is no information in the premise that contradicts the hypothesis. step 2: the hypothesis claims that moore has never received an order from a court. this directly contradicts the information in the premise. step 3: based on the provided information, the hypothesis cannot be logically inferred from the premise. in fact, the hypothesis contradicts the premise."
4324,"Although Ibiza's popularity as a holiday destination has never waned, the events of the past few years Seville Expo  92, the Barcelona Olympics have ensured its continued success.",Ibiza has never been more popular than during the Barcelona Olympics.,1,0,False,"step 1: the premise states that ibiza's popularity as a holiday destination has never waned, and it mentions the seville expo 92 and the barcelona olympics as contributing factors to its continued success. these events took place in the late 1980s and the 1990s, respectively. step 2: the hypothesis suggests that ibiza has never been more popular than during the barcelona olympics. this statement implies that ibiza's popularity during the barcelona olympics was the highest it has ever been. step 3: given the information from the premise, it is reasonable to infer that ibiza was quite popular during the barcelona olympics because they are cited as significant contributors to its continued success. however, the premise does not directly state that ibiza's popularity during the barcelona olympics was higher than at any other time. it only implies that it was a period of great success for ibiza. therefore, while the hypothesis is related to the premise, it goes beyond what can be logically inferred from it. step 4: based on the given information and logical reasoning, the hypothesis is not entailed by the premise, but it might be a reasonable assumption or approximation."
4325,"Quinn explores ' what it is to be human in the world today ' through subjects including the body, genetics, identity, the media.","Quinn explores 'what it is to be human in the world today' through subjects including the body, genetics, identity, environment and the media.",1,1,True,"step 1: in the premise, quinn is stated to explore 'what it is to be human in the world today' through various subjects, including the body, genetics, identity, and the media. these subjects provide a foundation for understanding human experiences and conditions in contemporary society. step 2: in the hypothesis, an additional subject, 'environment', is introduced. while not explicitly mentioned in the premise, exploring the relationship between humans and their environment is a common theme in discussions on human existence and contemporary life. the other subjects in the hypothesis are identical to those in the premise. step 3: the hypothesis can be inferred from the premise because the addition of the subject 'environment' expands upon the original subjects in a reasonable and logical manner. this expansion does not contradict the premise and is a natural extension of the exploration of what it is to be human in the world today."
4326,"Doctorow compares Starr to Joseph  Starr has shown us how a conscienceless, ideologically vindictive use of the investigative privilege can undercut the legitimacy of any duly elected American government.",Doctorow is a great admirer of Starr and his methods.,0,0,True,"step 1: the premise describes doctorow's comparison of starr to joseph, mentioning starr's conscienceless and ideologically vindictive actions that undercut american governments. it does not provide any direct information about doctorow's admiration for starr or his methods. however, a comparison can often imply some level of admiration or recognition of the subject's qualities, especially if the comparison is favorable. step 2: the hypothesis explicitly states that doctorow is a great admirer of starr and his methods. while the premise does not directly state this, it is possible that the comparison could be interpreted as implying such admiration based on common sense and the context of the comparison. however, the premise does not logically entail the hypothesis, as the comparison could be made for other reasons such as criticism or analysis. step 3: based on the information given, the hypothesis cannot be logically inferred from the premise. the comparison made in the premise alone does not logically entail doctorow's admiration for starr."
4327,"Your eye will be drawn right, but be sure not to miss the left junction at the sign for Watendlath.",The view to the right of the road is ranked among the best in the world.,1,0,False,"step 1: in the premise, the instruction 'your eye will be drawn right' suggests that there is something worth looking at or appreciating in that direction. however, it does not provide any direct information about the quality or ranking of the view. step 2: the hypothesis makes a statement about the ranking of the view to the right, which goes beyond the information provided in the premise. the hypothesis cannot be logically inferred from the premise as it adds new information rather than being a necessary or logical consequence. step 3: based on the logical analysis, the hypothesis is not entailed by the premise."
4328,LSC strongly encourages all its grantees to obtain other funding for the client community that Congress has legislated is eligible for LSC funding.,LSC does not encourage grantees to seek more funds ,0,0,True,"step 1: in the premise, lsc (legal services corporation) is stated to 'strongly encourage' grantees to obtain other funding for the client community. this encouragement implies that it is not only allowed but also beneficial for grantees to seek additional funds. step 2: the hypothesis, 'lsc does not encourage grantees to seek more funds', directly contradicts the information stated in the premise. step 3: based on the given premise, the hypothesis cannot be logically inferred and is, in fact, a contradiction."
4329,"Young people head for Teatro (facing the CityPark, next to the municipal theater; Tel. 291/759 959), D?? F?¡ Sol (Largo das Fontes; Tel. 291/241 464) and Clube Avenida on top of the Marina Shopping Ceter.",Clube avenida is next to the municipal center.,0,1,False,"step 1: the premise provides a list of places that young people head to, which includes teatro (the municipal theater), d?? f?¡ sol, and clube avenida. it also mentions the location of teatro, which is next to the municipal center. step 2: the hypothesis states that clube avenida is next to the municipal center. this relationship is already established in the premise with regard to teatro. therefore, the hypothesis is entailed by the premise. step 3: based on the logical consistency and factual information provided in the premise, the hypothesis is a logical inference."
4330,"A group of youths, one wearing a t-shirt labeled ""L.A. City Lounge South"", are working on a craft project that involves the use of flour.",A teacher is writing notes on a test.,0,0,True,"step 1: in the premise, a group of youths is engaged in a craft project using flour. flour is a common material used in various arts and crafts activities. there is no mention of a teacher or a test in the premise. step 2: the hypothesis describes an entirely different situation from the premise. there's no logical connection or implication of the hypothesis from the premise. step  3: based on the given information, the hypothesis, which is about a teacher writing notes on a test, cannot be logically inferred from the premise about a group of youths working on a craft project with flour."
4331,"To assert Spain's authority and extinguish dissent, he ordered the execution of five Creole rebels.",He had formerly ordered the execution of sixth Creole rebels. ,1,0,False,"step 1: in the premise, we have information about the spanish ruler ordering the execution of five creole rebels to assert his authority and suppress dissent. this indicates a historical context where the ruler used executions as a means to maintain control. the hypothesis suggests that the ruler had previously ordered the execution of another group of six creole rebels. step 2: the hypothesis is related to the premise as both involve the spanish ruler ordering executions of creole rebels. it does not contradict the premise, as the premise does not state that the ruler had never ordered executions of more than five rebels at a time. step 3: the hypothesis is not entailed by the premise, as the premise does not provide sufficient evidence to logically infer that there were previous executions of six rebels. while it is common for rulers in such contexts to execute more than one person at a time, the premise only specifically mentions the five rebels. therefore, more information would be needed to logically infer the hypothesis from the premise."
4332,and uh well if you if you got got him a power mower it'd probably take him a lot less time to do it but i enjoy doing it i feel good doing it uh i i feel a lot better doing it with a power mower with that with a  with a pull tractor on it so i don't have to push so hard,"Keeping the old push mower is the best idea, since it gets the job done as fast as a power mower.",0,0,True,"step 1: in the premise, the speaker expresses their preference for using a power mower over a push mower due to the time it takes and the physical effort required. however, the statement does not necessarily mean that a power mower is always faster or more efficient than a push mower. it merely indicates the speaker's experience and preference.step 2: the hypothesis asserts that keeping the old push mower is the best idea because it gets the job done as fast as a power mower. this contradicts the information in the premise, as the speaker states that a power mower gets the job done faster than a push mower.step 3: based on the information provided, the hypothesis cannot be logically inferred from the premise. in fact, the hypothesis contradicts the premise."
4333,oh yeah yeah if if it snowed that much in Denver you know they got that much up in the mountains you know just west of there,The mountains are a harsh environment to live in.,1,1,True,"step 1: in the premise, it is mentioned that when it snows a significant amount in denver, there is a large accumulation of snow in the mountains located to the west. this implies that the mountains have extreme weather conditions, which is a characteristic of harsh environments. step 2: the hypothesis, stating that the mountains are a harsh environment to live in, is consistent with the information in the premise and can be logically inferred as a consequence of the extreme weather conditions described. step 3: based on the logical connection between the premise and hypothesis, and the common-sense understanding that harsh environments are those with extreme weather, challenging terrain, or other adverse conditions, the hypothesis is a valid inference from the premise."
4334,Country markets start business around 8am and run through mid-afternoon.,The country markets stay open into the evening.,0,0,True,"step 1: in the premise, country markets are described as starting their business around 8am and running through mid-afternoon. this information indicates a typical market day where vendors arrive early and sell their goods until the afternoon. there is no mention of the markets staying open into the evening. step 2: the hypothesis proposes that the country markets stay open into the evening, which contradicts the information in the premise. markets starting their business in the morning and closing in the afternoon is inconsistent with markets staying open into the evening. step 3: based on the logical reasoning, the hypothesis cannot be inferred from the premise as it contradicts the given information."
4335,That's a good analogy to an election with many equally plausible candidates whose odds of winning might depend only on how much they spend compared with everyone else.,That analogy does not regard elections and odds of winning.,0,0,True,"step 1: in the premise, an analogy is drawn between an election with many equally plausible candidates and a situation where the odds of winning depend solely on how much one spends. the analogy implies a comparison between an election scenario and a situation involving spending and winning.step 2: the hypothesis denies the involvement of elections in the analogy. however, the premise explicitly states 'that's a good analogy to an election.' this information from the premise contradicts the hypothesis.step 3: based on the logical analysis, the hypothesis is not entailed by the premise, as the hypothesis contradicts a key aspect of the premise."
4336,"Two weeks ago, Sweeney brought a steelworkers union official to the National Press Club to illustrate how the WTO's prohibition against trade barriers facilitates the loss of U.S. manufacturing jobs to dumped imports and cheap labor abroad.",Sweeney never brought anyone from the union.,0,0,True,"step 1: in the premise, sweeney is stated to have brought a steelworkers union official to the national press club two weeks ago. this implies that sweeney had some intention of using the union official to make a point or illustrate a concept. step 2: the hypothesis directly contradicts the premise as it suggests that no one from the union was actually brought to the national press club. in order for the hypothesis to be logically inferred from the premise, there would need to be evidence or logical reasoning that supports the idea that no union official was present. however, there is no such information provided in the premise. step 3: based on the given information, there is no entailment between the premise and the hypothesis."
4337,"Shortly after, the buzz began to spread.",Everyone was talking about it.,1,1,True,"step 1: the premise 'shortly after, the buzz began to spread' suggests that news or information had started spreading rapidly among a group of people. this implies that there was a topic of conversation that had gained significant attention.step 2: the hypothesis 'everyone was talking about it' directly relates to the premise as it also implies that a topic had gained widespread attention and was being discussed among all individuals within the group. the hypothesis can be considered a likely or reasonable consequence of the premise.step 3: based on the logical connection between the premise and hypothesis, and the lack of contradictory information, the hypothesis can be inferred from the premise."
4338,It's enough to make you turn to drink.,"It was unlikely that, that could make you turn to drinking.",0,0,True,"step 1: in the premise, 'it's enough to make you turn to drink' is an idiomatic expression meaning that something is very upsetting or frustrating. it does not provide any specific information about the cause or context of this emotion. in the hypothesis, 'it was unlikely that, that' refers to a situation that was not probable. the second part of the hypothesis, 'could make you turn to drinking' is similar in meaning to the premise but has the added qualifier 'unlikely'. step 2: the hypothesis does not directly follow from the premise, as the premise does not imply anything about the likelihood of the situation making someone turn to drinking. idiomatic expressions should be understood based on their literal meaning, but also considering the intended meaning in the given context. in this case, the idiom 'enough to make you turn to drink' implies that the situation is very frustrating or upsetting, but it does not provide any information about the likelihood of someone turning to drinking as a result. step 3: based on the analysis of the given information, the hypothesis is not logically entailed by the premise."
4339,"With minimum wagers as low as 5a and a distinct lack of potentially impatient players waiting for you to decide your next move, electronic gaming is an alternative that many novice gamblers never move beyond.",Electronic gaming is best left to the professionals.,0,0,True,"step 1: in the premise, electronic gaming is described as an attractive option for novice gamblers due to its convenience and lack of pressure. the absence of impatient players and low minimum wagers make it accessible and less intimidating. step 2: the hypothesis, 'electronic gaming is best left to the professionals', presents a contrasting perspective. it suggests that electronic gaming is not suitable for the average player and is better handled by experienced gamblers. step 3: the hypothesis does not logically follow from the premise. the premise describes the appeal of electronic gaming for novice gamblers and does not provide any information about the skills or experience required to succeed in electronic gaming. while professionals may have an edge due to their experience and familiarity with the games, there is no inherent reason why novice gamblers cannot improve their skills and become proficient in electronic gaming. therefore, the hypothesis is not entailed by the premise."
4340,"The ideological impetus behind judicial developments in the last two areas, campaign finance and equal-time provisions, is related less to speech, except as a kind of constitutional cover, than to a revival of the old right to property--that is, the Supreme Court tends to disapprove of legislative and administrative efforts to require broadcasters to carry opposing viewpoints on the grounds that since it's their property, owners of television stations should be able to broadcast what they like.",The Supreme Court likes efforts to change what broadcasters do.,0,0,True,"step 1: in the premise, the focus is on the ideological motivations behind judicial decisions in campaign finance and equal-time provisions. the author argues that these decisions are more about property rights than speech. the property rights in question refer to the ownership of television stations. step 2: the hypothesis suggests that the supreme court likes efforts to change what broadcasters do. however, the premise does not indicate that the supreme court approves of changes to what broadcasters do, but rather that they disapprove of efforts to require broadcasters to carry opposing viewpoints based on their property rights. therefore, the hypothesis contradicts the premise. step 3: based on the logical reasoning and the contradiction between the premise and hypothesis, the hypothesis is not entailed by the premise."
4341,"Here's my nominee for worst movie of the year (complete category should  Worst Movie of the Year That Assumedly Adult Male Reviewers Slathered Over): There's Something About Mary --a pathetically sophomoric, penis-obsessed mess that wouldn't even appeal to Larry Flynt!",I regret spending money to watch There's Something About Mary.,1,1,True,"step 1: in the premise, the speaker expresses their strong disapproval for the movie 'there's something about mary' and labels it as 'sophomoric,' 'penis-obsessed,' and 'a mess.' this implies a negative opinion towards the movie.step 2: the hypothesis states 'i regret spending money to watch there's something about mary.' this is a logical inference from the premise as the speaker's strong disapproval of the movie would naturally lead to regret for having spent money to watch it.step 3: based on the logical reasoning, the hypothesis can be inferred from the premise."
4342,"Well, we've just got to get down to it, that's all.",We've been stalling this project for months.,1,0,False,"step 1: in the premise, 'we've just got to get down to it' is an idiomatic expression that means it's time to start working on something earnestly. no specific information about the project or the reason for the delay is provided. step 2: the hypothesis suggests that there has been a significant delay ('we've been stalling this project for months') in the project, which contradicts the premise's implication of starting to work diligently. step 3: based on the lack of information in the premise about the cause of the delay and the contradiction between the premise and hypothesis, the hypothesis cannot be logically inferred from the premise."
4343,"France is a large country of infinite variety, so a great many factors come into play as you decide which parts to visit.",The South of France is the most popular destination for visitors.,1,0,False,"step 1: the premise describes france as a large and varied country, implying that many factors must be considered when deciding which parts to visit. it does not, however, limit the popularity of any specific region. step 2: the hypothesis states that the south of france is the most popular destination for visitors, which is not directly stated or logically entailed in the premise. step 3: while common sense might suggest that certain areas, such as the south of france, could be more popular among visitors due to factors like climate or cultural attractions, the premise itself does not provide sufficient information to logically infer the hypothesis."
4344,it's one of um i do um television ratings and i process some ratings and put do graphics for their television stations those are their clients so,My work involves putting squeakers in rubber duckies.,0,0,True,"step 1: in the premise, the speaker describes their job in the context of television ratings and creating graphics for television stations. this job involves processing ratings and creating visual representations for clients in the media industry. there is no mention of putting squeakers in rubber duckies or any relation to that activity.step 2: the hypothesis presents an entirely different scenario, involving putting squeakers in rubber duckies. there is no logical connection or implication of this activity from the information presented in the premise.step 3: based on the given information, the hypothesis cannot be logically inferred from the premise, as they describe unrelated activities.label: 0"
4345,something really horrible and they just get away with it and nothing happens,"They can do something horrible, get away with it, but I think they should face more time.",1,0,False,"step 1: in the premise, it is stated that 'something really horrible' happened, and 'they just get away with it' without any consequences. this implies that the individuals responsible for the horrible act have not been held accountable. step 2: the hypothesis suggests that 'they should face more time,' which is a statement about desirability or justice, not a logical inference from the premise. however, the hypothesis can be related to the premise through the shared element of 'they,' who are the individuals responsible for the horrible act. step 3: while the hypothesis cannot be logically inferred from the premise, it is a reasonable extension based on the premise and common sense. in the real world, it is generally agreed that individuals who commit horrible acts should be held accountable and face consequences. the hypothesis expresses this common sense notion, but it goes beyond the information provided in the premise and therefore cannot be considered a logical entailment."
4346,"After signing with Columbia Records in 1979, Cash 's second studio album "" Wrong "" was released.","After signing with Columbia Records in 1979, Cash's second studio album ""Right or Wrong"" was released.",1,0,False,"step 1. in the premise, it is stated that cash signed with columbia records in 1979 and his second studio album 'wrong' was released after that. the hypothesis also mentions the same record label (columbia records) and the same year (1979) but instead suggests that 'right or wrong' was the second studio album released. step 2. since both the premise and hypothesis agree on the artist, record label, and time frame, the only difference is the title of the album. the titles 'wrong' and 'right or wrong' are similar and could potentially be interchangeable, especially given that there seems to be no indication of which title is correct in the premise itself. however, without definitive evidence proving that 'right or wrong' is indeed the correct title, the hypothesis cannot be considered logically entailed by the premise. step 3. based on the available information, it is impossible to definitively say if the hypothesis is entailed by the premise or not. while they share many similarities, the titles of the albums are different and without further context or evidence, we cannot infer one from the other."
4347,He celebrated the fact by announcing that the capital would be moved from Calcutta to a whole new city to be built in Delhi.,The capital has never moved locations in its history. ,0,0,True,"step 1: in the premise, it is stated that the capital was moved from calcutta to delhi. this implies that there was a previous capital location, which was calcutta, and a new capital location, which is delhi. step 2: the hypothesis, however, asserts that 'the capital has never moved locations in its history'. this directly contradicts the information in the premise. step 3: based on the logical contradiction between the premise and the hypothesis, the hypothesis cannot be logically inferred from the premise.step 4: it's important to note that the analysis here is based on the given information and does not consider any potential contextual factors or background knowledge that might influence the situation."
4348,"Moreover, it is possible to have questions that require nested case studies.","Also, questions can not require nested case studies.",0,0,True,"step 1: in the premise, it is stated that it is possible to have questions that require nested case studies. this means that some questions can be answered by considering multiple case studies, where each case study builds upon the information from the previous one. step 2: the hypothesis, on the other hand, states that questions cannot require nested case studies. this directly contradicts the premise, as the premise clearly illustrates an instance where a question does indeed require nested case studies to be answered fully. step 3: based on the logical contradiction between the premise and hypothesis, the hypothesis cannot be logically inferred from the premise.step 4: it is essential to understand that just because two statements contradict each other does not necessarily mean that one is incorrect or false. in this case, the premise and hypothesis are both valid in their respective contexts, but they cannot both be true at the same time. the premise describes a scenario where nested case studies are possible, while the hypothesis asserts that this is not the case.step 5: in summary, the hypothesis cannot be logically inferred from the premise due to the contradiction between the two statements."

4350,"This guidance, therefore, provides a flexible, risk-based framework for data reliability assessments that can be geared to the specific circumstances of each engagement.",The sole purpose of this guidance is to assess how much money is being frivolously spent in each engagement.,0,0,True,"step 1: in the premise, the guidance is described as a 'flexible, risk-based framework' for data reliability assessments. this implies that the approach can be tailored to various situations. no information is provided regarding the assessment of financial aspects or frivolous spending. step 2: the hypothesis 'the sole purpose of this guidance is to assess how much money is being frivolously spent in each engagement' contradicts the premise. the premise acknowledges that the assessment framework can be applied to various circumstances, not just financial ones. step 3: based on the given information, the hypothesis cannot be logically inferred from the premise."
4351,"The interior continues the bands of black and white marble, while elaborately inlaid marble paving one of the cathedral's primary attractions, with large sections regularly covered for protection covers the floor with 56 pictures of biblical and allegorical themes, done over two centuries by some 40 artists.",Many artists spent their entire careers creating the pictures now found on the cathedral floor.,1,1,True,"step 1: the premise describes the interior of a cathedral with marble bands and floors inlaid with pictures of biblical and allegorical themes, created by multiple artists over two centuries. step 2: the hypothesis suggests that 'many artists' spent their entire careers creating these pictures. this implication can be inferred from the information given in the premise, as it indicates that 'some 40 artists' were involved in the creation of the pictures over a span of two centuries. it's a reasonable assumption that some artists might have dedicated their entire careers to this project. step 3: based on the information provided in the premise and the logical implication from the hypothesis, the hypothesis can be inferred from the premise."
4352,"Aside from the occasional Ted Turner bombshell, the Gateses seem to have just about guaranteed themselves the top slot on The Slate 60 for the rest of their lives, even if they never give another nickel away.","The Gateses have never appeared on The Slate 60, probably because of the extreme philanthropist Ted Turner maintaining the top slot for decades.",0,0,True,"step 1: in the premise, it is mentioned that the gateses have guaranteed their top spot on the slate 60 for life due to their significant philanthropic contributions. however, there is no explicit statement about them having actually appeared on the slate 60 before. step 2: the hypothesis states that the gateses have never appeared on the slate 60. this statement contradicts the premise, as the premise implies that they have attained a top spot on the list. step 3: however, it is important to note that the premise does not necessarily mean that the gateses have actually appeared on the slate 60 before, it only implies that they have guaranteed a spot for life. the hypothesis, therefore, is not logically entailed by the premise, as the premise does not rule out the possibility that the gateses have never appeared on the list but have only secured a future spot. step 4: in light of this, it is likely that the premise and hypothesis describe different situations. the premise talks about the gateses' current position on the slate 60, while the hypothesis talks about their past appearance or lack thereof. step 5: based on this analysis, the hypothesis cannot be logically inferred from the premise, as they describe different aspects of the situation."
4353,"Once you've found a consistent division, you can be sure that no other is possible.","There is no other possible way once a consistent division is found, but some are claiming that there may be a possible way, although this is being argued very intensely in many fields.",1,0,False,"step 1: the premise asserts that when a consistent division is found, no other division is possible. this implies that the division process is deterministic and unique, meaning once the correct division is determined, no other divisions can be valid.step 2: the hypothesis introduces an element of disagreement, stating that some people argue for the possibility of other divisions despite a consistent one being found. this is a contradiction to the premise, as it suggests that there may exist other divisions that could be valid after a consistent one is determined.step 3: based on the given information, the hypothesis cannot be logically inferred from the premise as it contradicts it.step 4: the hypothesis presents an alternative perspective that challenges the premise, and while it may be argued passionately in various fields, it does not logically follow from the information provided in the premise.your reasoning: the hypothesis contradicts the premise, making it not entailed by it."
4355,Rugbyaand football (soccer) can be seen at the spectacular new Stade de France on the northern outskirts at St-Denis or at Parc-des-Princes at the south end of the Bois de Boulogne.,Rugby is not popular enough in France to be found in larger venues.,0,0,True,"step 1: in the premise, it is mentioned that both rugby and football (soccer) can be seen at stade de france and parc-des-princes, which are described as 'spectacular new' and 'larger venues' respectively. this implies that these venues are able to accommodate a large number of spectators. step 2: the hypothesis suggests that rugby is not popular enough to be found in larger venues. however, the premise itself contradicts this, as it states that rugby is indeed found in larger venues. step 3: based on the information provided in the premise, the hypothesis is not logically entailed and can be considered a contradiction."
4356,"Napoleon wanted it as a temple of glory for his army, but his architect suggested the Arc de Triomphe instead.","Arc de Triomphe was already built, so his architect never suggested it.",0,0,True,"step 1: in the premise, napoleon wanted to build a temple of glory for his army, but his architect suggested an alternative, the arc de triomphe. this implies that the arc de triomphe was a proposed structure, not an existing one at the time of the conversation. common sense tells us that architects propose new designs or suggest modifications to existing structures, they don't suggest already built structures as alternatives. step 2: the hypothesis, 'arc de triomphe was already built, so his architect never suggested it', contradicts the information provided in the premise. in the premise, it is stated that the architect suggested the arc de triomphe as an alternative, not that it was already built. step 3: based on the logical reasoning and the fact that the hypothesis contradicts the premise, it is clear that the hypothesis cannot be inferred from the premise."
4357,A man in a red sweater holds a child on top of his shoulders.,The man is touching the child.,1,1,True,"step 1: the premise describes a man wearing a red sweater holding a child on his shoulders. this indicates that the man is supporting the child's weight and likely maintaining physical contact with the child. it is a common sense understanding that holding someone involves touching them. step 2: the hypothesis is an accurate description of a situation that is logically implied by the premise. if a man is holding a child, then he is touching the child. step 3: based on logical reasoning and common sense, the hypothesis is entailed by the premise."
4358,"Of all the powers of the Science, the greatest lies in the true name.",The true name is an obscure and unimportant part of the Science.,0,0,True,"step 1: the premise suggests that the greatest power in the science lies in the true name. this implies that the true name is significant and holds great importance in the context of the science. step 2: the hypothesis, however, states that the true name is obscure and unimportant. this contradicts the information provided in the premise, as the premise indicates that the true name is of great importance and power. step 3: based on the logical contradiction between the premise and hypothesis, it can be concluded that the hypothesis is not entailed by the premise."
4359,"In both performance measurement and human capital development, practices used by the federal CIOs differed from those of CIOs in leading organizations, though federal CIOs were actively trying to address the issues.",Federal CIO's use the same practices as all other CIOs.,0,0,True,"step 1: the premise describes a situation where federal cios use different practices than other cios in performance measurement and human capital development. it also mentions that federal cios are attempting to address these differences. step 2: the hypothesis suggests that federal cios use the same practices as all other cios. however, the information in the premise directly contradicts this hypothesis, as the premise states that federal cios do not currently use the same practices. step 3: based on the logical contradiction between the premise and hypothesis, the hypothesis cannot be logically inferred from the premise."
4361,The higher savings rate would raise the growth rate.,The growth rate has been low recently compared to other years.,1,0,False,"step 1: in the premise, it is suggested that an increase in the savings rate has a causal relationship with a rise in the growth rate. no specific information is provided about the current growth rate or when the higher savings rate occurred.step 2: the hypothesis indicates that the growth rate has been lower recently compared to other years. this information does not contradict the premise, as the premise does not specify the current state of the growth rate.step  3: it is important to note that the hypothesis does not logically follow from the premise, as the premise does not guarantee that a higher savings rate will always lead to a higher growth rate in the current situation or time period. however, the premise does imply that there is a causal relationship between savings and growth rates in general. therefore, the hypothesis being false (low growth rate recently) does not necessarily mean that the premise is false (higher savings rate raises growth rate).step  4: to determine the entailment relationship between the hypothesis and the premise, we would need more context or additional information. for example, if we had specific data about the relationship between savings and growth rates, and the data showed a consistent pattern, we might be able to infer that the low growth rate was due to a decrease in savings. however, without this information, the hypothesis does not follow logically from the premise."
4362,USAT and the WP lead with the heating-up Paula Jones case.,The WP and USAT opted to lead with the case of Paula Jones due to the increased ratings.,1,1,True,"step 1: in the premise, usat (united states today) and wp (washington post) are mentioned as leading their publications with the paula jones case. the paula jones case refers to allegations made by paula jones against president bill clinton. no specific reason for their decision to lead with this case is provided in the premise.step 2: the hypothesis suggests that the wp and usat led with the paula jones case due to the increased ratings. this means that the high public interest or attention towards the case was the reason for their decision.step 3: the hypothesis does not contradict the premise but rather offers an explanation for the actions mentioned in the premise. while the premise does not provide information about the reasons for leading with the paula jones case, it is a common practice for media outlets to lead with high-rating stories. therefore, the hypothesis is a reasonable inference based on common sense and the given context.step 4: the hypothesis adds explanatory information to the premise, providing more context and detail about the actions of the wp and usat.based on the reasoning above, the hypothesis can be inferred from the premise."
4363,"The train's narrow roof beckoned me, boasting of safety... The roof lied.",The train's roof was shaky.,0,1,False,"step 1: the premise describes a situation where the speaker is on a train and expresses a false sense of safety based on the train's narrow roof. this implies that the roof might not be as safe as it appears. step 2: the hypothesis suggests that the train's roof was shaky. this is a reasonable inference from the premise, as a false sense of safety could be due to a misleading appearance, and a shaky roof would indeed mislead the speaker. step 3: based on the logical connection between the premise and hypothesis, and the common-sense understanding that a false sense of safety can be caused by a hidden danger like a shaky roof, the hypothesis can be inferred from the premise."
4364,The previous winners were all quality people.,These people were from the wealthiest political families in the country.,1,0,False,"step 1: the premise states that the previous winners were all 'quality people'. this means they possessed desirable traits such as integrity, competence, and respectability. step 2: the hypothesis suggests that these 'quality people' were from the wealthiest political families in the country. however, the premise does not provide any information regarding the financial status or background of the previous winners. step 3: while it is not possible to logically infer the hypothesis from the premise because the premise does not contain the necessary information, it is important to note that the hypothesis does not contradict the premise either. the lack of evidence to support the hypothesis does not negate its possibility, but it also does not make it a logical consequence of the premise."
4365,A little boy bowls in a carpeted hallway.,A boy is skipping rope.,0,0,True,"step 1: in the premise, a little boy is bowling in a carpeted hallway. bowling involves rolling a heavy ball towards pins, which are typically set up in a rectangular lane. a carpeted hallway is not a typical location for bowling. however, the key information here is that a boy is performing an activity.step 2: the hypothesis suggests a different activity for the boy: skipping rope. skipping rope is an activity that does not depend on a specific location. it can be done in various settings, including a carpeted hallway.step 3: the hypothesis cannot be logically inferred from the premise because the activities described in each sentence are distinct. bowling and skipping rope are two different activities, and there is no way to infer one from the other based on the given information."
4366,To the south of it are remains of the Basilica Julia law court and the Rostra orators' platform from which Mark Antony informed the people of Caesar's assassination.,"When Caesar was assassinated, Mark Anthony chose not to announce this fact to the public. ",0,0,True,"step 1. in the premise, we have information about the location of the basilica julia law court and rostra orators' platform, and we know that mark antony used this platform to announce caesar's assassination to the public. step 2. the hypothesis suggests that mark antony did not make this announcement when caesar was assassinated. this contradicts the information given in the premise, as the premise explicitly states that mark antony did, in fact, use the rostra to announce caesar's assassination to the public. step 3. based on the information provided, the hypothesis cannot be logically inferred from the premise. the hypothesis is in fact the opposite of what is stated in the premise."
4367,Those others are presumably still in office.,Those others have left office years ago.,0,0,True,"step 1: the premise indicates that 'those others' are currently in office or holding a position. step 2: the hypothesis suggests that 'those others' have left office years ago. this hypothesis contradicts the information in the premise as the premise states that 'those others' are still in office, while the hypothesis claims they have left years ago. step 3: based on the contradiction, the hypothesis cannot be logically inferred from the premise as the hypothesis goes against the information provided in the premise.step 4: it's important to note that the lack of entailment does not imply that the hypothesis is necessarily false, only that it cannot be logically derived from the premise."
4368,"We now know many facts about Minoan Crete including that at the height of its influence, the population probably numbered more than 2 million, about four times greater than today's figure, with 100,000 people in the capital, Knosses.",The people lived in compact apartment style buildings made of stone.,1,1,True,"step 1: the premise provides information about the population size and the number of people living in the capital city, knossos, during the height of minoan crete's influence. there is no direct mention of the living arrangements or building styles. however, the population size suggests a densely populated area to accommodate such a large population. common sense and historical knowledge indicate that compact living arrangements could be a likely solution for accommodating a large population. step 2: the hypothesis suggests that the people lived in compact apartment-style buildings made of stone. this hypothesis is consistent with the premise's information about the population size and the need for compact living arrangements. step 3: based on the logical connection between the premise and hypothesis, the hypothesis can be inferred from the premise. the premise does not directly state that the people lived in apartment-style buildings, but the information provided in the premise, along with common sense and logical reasoning, supports the hypothesis."
4369,when you were um when when you  serve it do you shell them and then serve them to,You only have to shell them if you serve them raw.,0,0,True,"step 1: the premise describes an action, 'when you serve it,' but it's unclear if the served dish is cooked or raw. the hypothesis suggests that 'shelling them' is only necessary when serving 'them' raw. step 2: the logical connection between the premise and hypothesis is not directly apparent, but we can infer that the 'them' in the hypothesis refers to the same 'it' in the premise, which could be nuts (in which case shelling is necessary for serving raw nuts) or peas (in which case shelling is not necessary for serving cooked peas). step 3: to determine if the hypothesis is entailed by the premise, we need more context or clarification on the nature of 'it' in the premise. in its current form, the premise does not provide enough information to logically infer the hypothesis."
4370,uh-huh yeah no talking to my folks in Wyoming they uh they were still hoping they get some more because if they don't they're going to have water problems this summer so,My parents don't want any more even though they don't anticipate any water problems.,0,0,True,"step 1: in the premise, the speaker mentions that their parents 'were still hoping they get some more' implying that they want or need more water. the reason for their desire for more water is stated to be due to potential water problems in the summer. step 2: in contrast, the hypothesis states that 'my parents don't want any more' which contradicts the information provided in the premise about their desire for more water. step 3: the hypothesis that 'my parents don't want any more even though they don't anticipate any water problems' cannot be logically inferred from the premise as it contradicts the information about their desire for more water and there is no mention of their current wants or needs in the premise being irrelevant to water problems. step 4: based on the logical analysis, the hypothesis cannot be inferred from the premise."
4371,Tuppence rose.,Tuppence remained seated.,0,0,True,"step 1: analyzing the given premise 'tuppence rose', we identify 'tuppence' as the subject and 'rose' as the action. this suggests that tuppence stood up from a sitting or lying position. step 2: contrarily, the hypothesis 'tuppence remained seated' states that tuppence did not change her position and stayed seated. these two statements contradict each other. step 3: based on the logical contradiction and given that the hypothesis is not entailed by the premise, the hypothesis 'tuppence remained seated' cannot be logically inferred from 'tuppence rose'."
4372,"Ah, yes, actually, two weeks ago we had a very similar situation, the captain alertly added and quickly changed the subject, 'What's important now is that you get ready for about 2 minutes in the state of weightlessness, and not some Slovakian satellite from two weeks ago.",The captain of the ship didn't want to bring up the destruction of the Slovakian satellite that happened two weeks prior. ,1,1,True,"step 1: in the premise, the captain is changing the subject from a previous event that happened two weeks ago, which was the destruction of a slovakian satellite. he does this to prepare the passengers for an experience of weightlessness. step 2: the hypothesis suggests that the captain didn't want to discuss the destruction of the satellite. this can be logically inferred from the premise because the change of subject indicates that the captain didn't want to dwell on the unfortunate event. step 3: based on the logical connection between the premise and hypothesis, and the common sense understanding that a captain might change the subject to avoid discussing a potentially distressing topic, the hypothesis is a valid inference from the premise.step 4: additionally, there is no contradictory information in the premise or hypothesis, as both statements involve the captain's actions and the topic of the slovakian satellite.therefore, the hypothesis is a logical entailment of the premise."
4373,Both professors soon realized that creating a new language was not an easy task.,Professors realized it was easy to make a new language.,0,0,True,"step 1: in the premise, the text states that creating a new language was not an easy task for the professors. this implies that the process of creating a new language is complex and challenging. common sense and experience tell us that creating a new language is indeed a difficult task. no facts are provided that contradict this understanding.step 2: the hypothesis, 'professors realized it was easy to make a new language,' contradicts the information in the premise. the hypothesis suggests that the professors found the task of creating a new language to be simple or effortless, which is not indicated or supported by the premise.step 3: based on the information in the premise and the logical contradiction between the premise and hypothesis, the hypothesis cannot be logically inferred from the premise."
4374,uh-huh oh yeah well Sheba Sheba the himmy loves to play with the paper she uh she gets she likes to crawl inside of it and she thinks she's hiding and nobody can see her and uh she'll jump all over it and tear it to shreds she's something she she's a stubby little thing she's big for her age she got little short legs and great big paws  and she's not she's not athletic like Kitty Cat i mean the two of them these two are the favorite playmates,"Sheba the himmy likes to eat the paper to help her grow her stubby, short legs.",1,0,False,"step 1. the premise describes sheba, a himmy (a pet name), as a small animal that enjoys crawling inside paper and tearing it to shreds. it also mentions her short legs and large paws. the premise does not provide any information about sheba consuming or eating paper for growth. however, the description of sheba's behavior with paper and her physical appearance is given.step 2. the hypothesis suggests a possible new piece of information: sheba eats paper to help her grow her short legs. this is not explicitly stated or logically implied in the premise.step 3. based on the given information, there is no clear logical entailment between the premise and the hypothesis. the hypothesis adds an extra assumption that is not directly related to or inferred from the provided information in the premise. therefore, the hypothesis cannot be logically inferred from the premise."
4375,"Well, Texas sure is a great big piece o' country, so maybe you don't know 'bout them river tricks.","Greenland is a nice time to visit in the summer, so maybe you know about the travel plans.",0,0,True,"step 1. in the premise, the speaker expresses their knowledge or experience about the vastness of texas and implies a possible lack of knowledge about 'river tricks'. this doesn't provide any direct information about greenland or visiting it in the summer. in the hypothesis, the speaker is expressing a positive opinion about visiting greenland during the summer. step 2. there is no logical connection between the premise and hypothesis as the two sentences discuss different topics: texas and its size compared to a person's knowledge, and greenland and the desirability of visiting it during the summer. step 3. based on the given information, the hypothesis cannot be logically inferred from the premise as they address unrelated topics."
4376,yes we all enjoy camping and they're you know they're in like R As and scouts and stuff like that you know so they get to go camping in those organizations also,Everybody that I know hates camping because you're forced to do it with the scouts.,0,0,True,"step 1. in the premise, it is stated that 'we all enjoy camping' and that 'they're in r as and scouts and stuff like that', implying that 'they' are also campers. the premise does not provide any information about the speaker's personal feelings or any negative experiences they or others have had with camping.step 2. the hypothesis states 'everybody that i know hates camping because you're forced to do it with the scouts'. this contradicts the premise, as the premise states that 'we all enjoy camping' and 'they' are campers. the hypothesis also does not provide any evidence or reasons to support the claim that everyone the speaker knows hates camping specifically because they have to do it with the scouts.step 3. based on the logical analysis and the contradiction between the premise and hypothesis, it can be concluded that the hypothesis is not entailed by the premise. the premise does not support the hypothesis in any way."
4377,The ornate ancestral temple Leong San Tong stands opposite a smaller hall used for open-air Chinese opera and theater.,People always visit the temple and theater together.,1,0,False,"step 1: in the premise, we have two structures - leong san tong (a larger ornate temple) and a smaller hall used for chinese opera and theater. they are located opposite each other. no specific information is given about the relationship between the visitors of these two structures. step 2: the hypothesis suggests that people always visit the temple and theater together. this implies a causal or associative relationship between the visiting of the temple and the theater. step 3: given the information in the premise, there is no logical or factual reason to infer that people always visit the temple and theater together. the premise only establishes their spatial relationship, not their temporal or causal relationship. thus, the hypothesis cannot be logically inferred from the premise.step 4: however, it is important to note that the absence of evidence for the hypothesis does not prove its falsity. the premise might not provide enough information to infer the hypothesis, but there could still be circumstances or cultural practices that support this association. nonetheless, based on the given premise alone, the hypothesis is not entailed."
4378,"But the warm-hearted, high-spirited Neapolitans in no way feel themselves inferior to the cool, pragmatic  managerial  types of the vibrant northern cities.",Neapolitans are nice areas with good living environments. ,1,0,False,"step 1: in the premise, the neapolitans are described as warm-hearted and high-spirited people who do not feel inferior to the northern cities and their managerial types. this implies that they have a strong sense of self-worth and pride in their culture. the premise does not provide any negative or derogatory information about neapolitans or their areas. step 2: the hypothesis describes neapolitans as 'nice areas with good living environments'. this is not a direct logical consequence of the premise, but it is a positive assessment of neapolitans and their places. such a positive assessment is consistent with the neapolitans' positive self-perception and the lack of negative information in the premise. step 3: although the hypothesis is not logically entailed by the premise, it is a reasonable inference based on the positive information provided in the premise and the common-sense understanding that nice living environments contribute to the overall well-being and pride of the people who inhabit them. step 4: considering the logical connections, commonsense understanding, and factual consistency, the hypothesis can be seen as a reasonable and positive inference from the premise."
4379,"A young women, in a black shirt, is holding a bike, while a young boy is holding a skateboard.",A young woman and young boy are holding hands.,0,0,True,"step 1: in the premise, we have two young individuals, one is a woman identified by her black shirt, and the other is a boy. they are both holding items - a bike for the woman and a skateboard for the boy. there is no information suggesting they are interacting in any other way. step 2: the hypothesis suggests an interaction between the woman and the boy, specifically holding hands. however, the premise does not provide any information or logical implications suggesting the women and the boy are holding hands. step 3: based on the given information, the hypothesis 'a young woman and young boy are holding hands' cannot be logically inferred from the premise 'a young women, in a black shirt, is holding a bike, while a young boy is holding a skateboard'."
4380,oh my word oh was it we trew grew cantaloupe last year and that's how they were just tasteless you couldn't even eat them,We grew cantaloupe last year and they were great.,0,0,True,"step 1: in the premise, it is stated that cantaloupe was grown last year but they turned out to be tasteless. the hypothesis suggests that the cantaloupe grown last year were great.step 2: the hypothesis does not logically follow from the premise. the tastelessness of the cantaloupe in the premise does not necessarily mean that they were not great. there could be various reasons why the cantaloupe were tasteless, such as improper ripening, disease, or poor farming practices. the hypothesis, on the other hand, makes a positive claim about the quality of the cantaloupe.step 3: based on the given information, the hypothesis cannot be logically inferred from the premise."
4381,business expenses and all those kind things,Income exceeded business expenses. ,1,0,False,"step 1: in the premise, 'business expenses and all those kind things' are mentioned, indicating the existence and costs related to running a business. however, the premise does not provide explicit numerical values or information about income.step 2: the hypothesis suggests that income has exceeded expenses, indicating a positive net income. although the premise does not directly provide this information, it does not contradict the hypothesis. the hypothesis can be seen as a possible outcome when the business incurs expenses but still manages to generate more income.step 3: based on the lack of contradiction between the premise and hypothesis, and the possibility that the premise could be part of a larger context where income is eventually mentioned or implied, the hypothesis can be considered a logical inference.step 4: however, it's important to note that the hypothesis might not be a definitive conclusion, as more information would be needed to confirm that income indeed exceeded expenses in the specific situation described in the premise."
4382,"These were the Arawaks, who lived from fishing and planting, and produced beautiful pottery.",The Arawaks were artists who only ate fish and plants.,1,0,False,"step 1: in the premise, the arawaks are described as people who lived from fishing and planting, and they produced beautiful pottery. this implies that their livelihood was based on these two activities, and they had the skill to create artistic pottery. step 2: the hypothesis states that the arawaks were artists who only ate fish and plants. while the premise does not directly state what the arawaks ate, it does not contradict the hypothesis, as there is no information given to the contrary. the hypothesis is not logically inferred from the premise, but it is not in contradiction with it either. step 3: based on the given information, the hypothesis is not entailed by the premise, but it is also not contradictory to it."
4383,With trembling fingers they 176 unfolded it.,The fingers were steady as they unfolded it.,0,0,True,"step 1: the premise describes an action where someone's fingers are trembling as they unfold something. this information indicates a lack of stability or control in the finger movements. step 2: the hypothesis suggests that the fingers were steady during the unfolding process. this statement contradicts the information in the premise. therefore, it is not logically entailed by the premise. step 3: the hypothesis that 'the fingers were steady as they unfolded it' directly contradicts the premise, which states 'with trembling fingers they unfolded it'. thus, it cannot be inferred from the given premise."
4384,It's a phase some kids go through.,Sucking their thumb is a phase children go through. ,1,1,True,"step 1: in the premise, 'it's a phase some kids go through' refers to a stage or period in a child's development where they exhibit certain behaviors. this is a common idiomatic expression used to describe growing out of a behavior or habit. the hypothesis 'sucking their thumb is a phase children go through' is stating that thumb-sucking is a behavior or habit children grow out of.step 2: the hypothesis can be inferred from the premise because the concept of 'phases' or 'stages' children go through implies that they will eventually grow out of the behaviors associated with those phases. thumb-sucking is indeed a behavior that many children exhibit during their development, and it is common for them to outgrow it.step 3: based on the logical connection between the premise and hypothesis, and the common understanding of the idiom 'it's a phase,' the hypothesis can be logically inferred from the premise."
4385,A team of people on a bike race.,The people are riding bikes.,1,1,True,step 1: a bike race involves people participating in the event on bikes. the term 'bike race' itself indicates that bikes are being used. no contradictory information is present in the premise.step 2: the hypothesis 'the people are riding bikes' is directly implied in the premise 'a team of people on a bike race'. the hypothesis is a more specific version of the information given in the premise.step 3: the hypothesis can be inferred from the premise as it is a logical consequence and a more detailed description of the situation presented in the premise.
4386,Albino Alligator (Miramax).,Albino alligators are very rare in wild.,1,0,False,"step 1. in the premise, 'albino alligator (miramax)' is a reference to a movie title. the term 'albino alligator' does not provide any additional context or information about the real-world existence or rarity of albino alligators. step 2. the hypothesis, 'albino alligators are very rare in the wild,' is a statement about a factual property of albino alligators in the natural world. step 3. the premise does not provide any information that directly supports or contradicts the hypothesis. however, it is a commonly known fact that albino animals, including alligators, are indeed very rare in the wild due to their lack of camouflage. therefore, while the premise does not entail the hypothesis, the hypothesis is a reasonable and likely inference based on common knowledge. step 4. while the premise does not logically entail the hypothesis, the hypothesis can be reasonably inferred from the conjunction of the premise and common knowledge.step 5. in real-world reasoning, it is important to consider the context, including the premise and any background knowledge. in this case, the premise is a movie title, and the hypothesis is a factual statement about albino alligators. while the premise does not directly provide the information needed to logically infer the hypothesis, the hypothesis is a well-known fact that can be inferred from common knowledge.step 6. in summary, while the premise does not logically entail the hypothesis, the hypothesis can be reasonably inferred from the conjunction of the premise and common knowledge."
4387,"I just had a lot of anger and frustration pent up, and it sounded like this man was dangerously close to blowing my cover.",I was very calm and collected.,0,0,True,"step 1: in the premise, the speaker acknowledges feeling angry and frustrated, suggesting heightened emotions. step 2. the hypothesis, stating that the speaker was 'very calm and collected', contradicts the information given in the premise. common sense and logical reasoning tell us that feeling angry and frustrated is the opposite of being calm and collected. step 3: based on the given information, the hypothesis cannot be logically inferred from the premise as it contradicts it."
4388,A large percentage of the Jews killed both in Eastern and Western Europe were either nonobservant.,A large percentage of the Jews killed both in Eastern and Western Europe were either nonobservant or had not received even an elementary level Jewish education.,1,1,True,"step 1: in the premise, 'a large percentage of the jews killed both in eastern and western europe' refers to a significant number of jews who were killed during the holocaust. the fact that they were 'either nonobservant' implies that they did not strictly follow jewish religious practices and laws. step 2: the hypothesis adds an additional condition 'or had not received even an elementary level jewish education'. this condition is related to the premise as many jews, due to economic or geographical reasons, may not have had access to formal jewish education, which could have influenced their level of observance. step 3: given that the premise states that the majority of the killed jews were nonobservant, it is reasonable to assume that a significant number of them might also not have received a formal jewish education. therefore, the hypothesis can be logically inferred from the premise as it expands upon the condition of the jews being nonobservant."
4389,"However, for nearly everyone visiting Nepal, the Himalayas, whether experienced from the comfort of a hotel terrace, from the seat of plane, or from along the trail, are at the heart of a visit to Nepal.","Only a small number of visitors actually hike in the Himalayas, but all visitors see them.",1,0,False,"step 1: in the premise, it is stated that 'for nearly everyone visiting nepal, the himalayas are at the heart of a visit to nepal.' this implies that the himalayas play a significant role in the experience of most nepal visitors. the premise does not specify, however, that all visitors physically hike in the himalayas. it only mentions that 'they' (the himalayas) are a central part of the visit for most people. step 2: the hypothesis suggests that 'only a small number of visitors actually hike in the himalayas, but all visitors see them.' this contradicts the premise, as it implies that the majority of visitors do not have a direct experience of the himalayas (hiking), despite the premise stating that the himalayas are a central part of the visit for most people. step 3: based on the logical contradiction between the premise and hypothesis, and the lack of information in the premise suggesting that only a small number of visitors hike in the himalayas, the hypothesis cannot be logically inferred from the premise."
4390,"The unintended side effect is radical, direct  In what other state do voters set the tax rates?","There is a radical side effect that was not intended, said the teacher.",1,0,False,"step 1: in the premise, 'unintended side effect' refers to an unplanned consequence. the state of 'radical' describes something extreme or fundamental in nature. no specific context is given regarding taxes or voters. in the hypothesis, 'radical side effect' is repeated, and the term 'said the teacher' indicates that this is a statement made by someone. however, there is no clear indication that the hypothesis is related to the premise or changes the previous context.step 2: the hypothesis does not logically follow from the premise as it does not provide any new information that can be logically derived from the premise. there is no explicit or implicit connection between 'unintended side effect' in the premise and 'radical side effect' in the hypothesis, and the teacher's statement does not affect the meaning of the premise.step 3: based on the logical analysis, the hypothesis is not entailed by the premise, and there is no clear inferential relationship between them."
4391,"The object of the game is to come as close as possible to 9; the only real skill involved is deciding whether to bet on the player or the bank (i.e., the dealer).",Coming close to nine is a sure way to lose the game.,0,0,True,"step 1: in the premise, it is stated that the goal of the game is to come as close as possible to 9. this implies that reaching or surpassing the number 9 results in a loss. however, the premise also mentions that betting on the player or the bank is the only real skill involved, and that coming close to nine is not explicitly stated as a loss-inducing condition on its own. step 2: the hypothesis suggests a negative relationship between coming close to nine and winning the game, which is not directly inferred from the premise. the premise only states that coming close to nine is the goal and that reaching it or surpassing it results in a loss when betting is involved. step 3: based on the given information, the hypothesis cannot be logically inferred from the premise as it suggests a more general and negative relationship between coming close to nine and losing the game, while the premise only implies this when betting is involved. therefore, the hypothesis is not entailed by the premise."
4392,Two cyclist a man and a woman enjoy a leisurely bike ride on the cobblestone path.,The two people are taking a stroll through a museum.,0,0,True,"step 1: in the premise, we have the information that there are two people, a man and a woman, engaging in a leisurely activity on a cobblestone path. this scenario could involve various activities such as biking, walking, or even having a picnic. the context does not specify an indoor location nor does it indicate any particular object of interest.step 2: the hypothesis states that the two people are taking a stroll through a museum. there is no logical connection or necessary implication between the premise and this hypothesis. the hypothesis introduces a new context (a museum) that is not present or suggested in the premise.step 3: based on the information provided, the hypothesis 'the two people are taking a stroll through a museum' cannot be logically inferred from the premise 'two cyclists, a man and a woman, enjoy a leisurely bike ride on the cobblestone path'. the hypothesis contradicts the premise in terms of the activity being done and the context of the scene."
4393,a white dinner jacket or something and so you can only wear a white dinner jacket between those two,There isn't another choice. ,1,1,True,"step 1: in the premise, it is stated that there are only two times when you can wear a white dinner jacket. this implies that there isn't a third or any other choice available for wearing a white dinner jacket.step 2: the hypothesis, 'there isn't another choice', directly aligns with the premise as it also conveys the idea that there is no other option or alternative.step 3: based on the logical relationship and no contradictory information, the hypothesis is entailed by the premise."
4395,"Around 1548 St. Francis Xavier began his mission among the pearl fishermen of Goa, before he set sail for Japan.",St Francis exavier didn't ever make it to Japan. ,0,0,True,"step 1: in the premise, st. francis xavier started his mission among the pearl fishermen of goa around 1548. he then set sail for japan. this timeline indicates that st. francis xavier indeed went to japan after his mission in goa.step 2: the hypothesis, on the other hand, states that st. francis xavier never made it to japan. this contradicts the information provided in the premise, indicating a clear lack of logical entailment.step 3: based on the given premise, st. francis xavier's journey to japan is a known fact, and the hypothesis suggesting otherwise cannot be logically inferred from the premise."
4396,"One part each, lending each its own essential quality to the mixture, so that the sky is solid as earth, radiant as fire, formless as water, insubstantial as air.",The combination of which makes the whole.,1,1,True,"step 1: in the premise, the author uses the metaphor of the sky having essential qualities of earth, fire, water, and air. this metaphor implies that these elements come together to form the whole of the sky. the hypothesis, 'the combination of which makes the whole,' directly relates to the premise, as it describes the result of the individual elements coming together. step 2: the hypothesis can be logically inferred from the premise, as the metaphor in the premise sets up the expectation that the individual elements combine to form the whole. step 3: based on the logical connection between the premise and hypothesis, and the common metaphorical understanding that elements coming together form a whole, the hypothesis can be inferred from the premise."
4397,It said that cancellation of President Clinton's planned visit to India this fall would be disastrous and only intensify nationalist fervor in that country.,President Clinton never planned to visit India.,0,0,True,"step 1: in the premise, it is stated that the cancellation of president clinton's planned visit to india would be disastrous and intensify nationalist fervor. this implies that there was indeed a plan for president clinton to visit india. step 2: the hypothesis states that president clinton never planned to visit india. this contradicts the information provided in the premise, as the premise assumes the existence of a planned visit. step 3: based on the provided logical reasoning and the given information, the hypothesis 'president clinton never planned to visit india' is not entailed by the premise."
4398,all the time i got real used to it then i felt like we roughed it then,"I never got used to it, it felt like we were living in luxury. ",0,0,True,"step 1: the premise describes a situation where the speaker 'got used to it' which implies an adaptation to certain conditions. however, the premise also includes the phrase 'then i felt like we roughed it' which suggests a change in circumstances, possibly implying a return to harsher conditions or a new realization of discomfort. step 2: the hypothesis states 'i never got used to it, it felt like we were living in luxury.' this is the direct opposite of the premise, as it implies that the speaker never adapted to the conditions and instead found them comfortable or even luxurious. step 3: the hypothesis cannot be logically inferred from the premise as they present contradictory information. the hypothesis suggests a lack of adaptation to the conditions, while the premise implies an adaptation. therefore, the hypothesis is not entailed by the premise."
4399,where they're at school from what eight to three or something and then i would be at my school teaching,They only attend school for three hours a day.,0,0,True,"step 1. the premise states that 'they' are at school from 8 to 3, which can be interpreted as being present at the school for a total of five hours. step 2. the hypothesis proposes that 'they' only attend school for three hours a day. the hypothesis contradicts the information given in the premise, as three hours is less than the five hours mentioned. step 3. based on the logical inconsistency between the premise and the hypothesis, the hypothesis cannot be inferred from the premise."
4400,Istanbul owes its long-held historical significance to a stra?­tegic location at the mouth of the Bosphorus.,Istanbul is the only city near the Bosphorus.,1,0,False,"step 1: the premise explains that istanbul's historical significance is due to its strategic location at the mouth of the bosphorus. this implies that istanbul is one of the cities or places near the bosphorus. it does not, however, state that it is the only city. common sense and historical facts tell us that there may be other cities or towns near the bosphorus.step 2: the hypothesis, 'istanbul is the only city near the bosphorus', contradicts the information in the premise, as the premise does not guarantee that there are no other cities near the bosphorus.step 3: based on the given information and logical reasoning, the hypothesis cannot be inferred from the premise."
4401,"At least they were in here, drinking, too.",There were several people drinking because it was the weekend.,1,1,True,"step 1: in the premise, 'they' were identified as being in the same location and engaging in the activity of drinking. the use of 'at least' implies that there might be more than just the two people mentioned. step 2: the hypothesis suggests that 'several people' were drinking during the weekend. the premise does not explicitly state the day of the week, but the use of the term 'weekend' in the hypothesis implies that the drinking took place during the weekend. given that 'at least' two people were drinking in the premise, it is reasonable to infer that 'several' people could have been drinking based on common sense and the context of the premise. step 3: based on the logical reasoning, the use of 'at least' in the premise implying the possibility of more than two people drinking, and the common sense understanding that weekends are a typical time for social gatherings and drinking, the hypothesis can be inferred from the premise.step 4: it's also important to note that the hypothesis does not contradict the premise in any way and both sentences can coexist."
4402,"Flowing in and out of 80 arched passageways known as vomitoria, aristocrats and plebs alike came to see bears, lions, tigers, and leopards starved into fighting each other and against criminals, war captives, and (according to some historians) Christians.",Christians were not really forced to fight lions or bears.,1,0,False,"step 1: in the premise, it mentions that christians were among the people forced to fight animals in the colosseum. however, the premise does not specify the nature of this 'forcing'. it is possible that christians were coerced into participating as gladiators, but it is also mentioned that they could have been compelled to fight against animals as part of the spectacle. step 2: the hypothesis challenges the premise by suggesting that christians were not truly compelled to fight lions or bears. to evaluate this, we need to consider the historical context and logical implications of such an event. it is important to note that there is substantial historical evidence indicating that christians were indeed forced to fight animals in the colosseum as part of the gladiatorial games. this is documented in various ancient sources, including christian texts and roman historians. step 3: based on the historical evidence and logical consistency, the hypothesis that 'christians were not really forced to fight lions or bears' is not entailed by the premise. in fact, it contradicts the available historical evidence.step 4: it is crucial to distinguish between christians being forced to fight as gladiators, which is well-documented, and the specific instance of being forced to fight against animals. while it is less clear whether christians were specifically forced to fight lions and bears, there is no credible evidence suggesting that they were not. moreover, it is not illogical to assume that they could have been, given the general context of the gladiatorial games and the use of christians and other groups as spectacle.step 5: in conclusion, the hypothesis cannot be logically inferred from the premise. the premise does not necessarily imply that christians were forced to fight lions and bears in the same sense that they were forced to be gladiators, and there is historical evidence that they were indeed forced to fight animals. the hypothesis contradicts this evidence and lacks sufficient logical or factual support."
4403,"The administrative approval normally is based on verification that the items ordered were actually received and met the government's specifications, and thus validates a vendor's request (invoice) for payment.",Verification of invoice approval is a long and tedious process and may delay payment for months.,1,1,True,"step 1: in the premise, it is stated that administrative approval is based on verification that items were received and met government specifications. this verification process is necessary to validate a vendor's request for payment. step 2: the hypothesis suggests that the invoice approval process is long and tedious, possibly delaying payment for months. this is a reasonable inference from the premise, as the verification process itself takes time to ensure accuracy and compliance with government regulations. common sense would also suggest that thorough verification may take longer than a simple approval process. step 3: based on the logical connection between the premise and hypothesis, and the common-sense understanding that verification processes can take time, the hypothesis is a reasonable inference from the premise."
4404,was it was it a criminal,Last night she thought she spotted someone attempting to break into her car.,1,1,True,"step 1: in the premise, no explicit statement is made about the identity of 'was it'. however, the context suggests that 'was it' is a question being asked about an event. the event described in the hypothesis, 'someone attempting to break into her car', is a criminal act.step 2: the hypothesis, 'last night she thought she spotted someone attempting to break into her car', can be logically inferred from the premise, 'was it', because the hypothesis describes a possible answer to the question. the hypothesis provides a specific event that could answer the question.step 3: based on the logical relationship between the premise and hypothesis, and the lack of contradictory information, the hypothesis is entailed by the premise."
4405,I'll try to do better next time.,I'll try to do better the next time I'm president. ,1,1,True,"step 1: in the premise, the speaker expresses an intention to improve in the future. 'next time' refers to any future occasion. in the hypothesis, the same speaker expresses an intention to improve, but this time, it's specifically related to being president. the premise does not limit 'next time' to being only when the speaker is president. however, there is no contradiction between the two sentences.step 2: the hypothesis can be reasonably inferred from the premise because the premise does not restrict the 'next time' to a specific context. the hypothesis adds a context (being president) to the premise, which does not contradict the original statement.step 3: based on the logical reasoning and lack of contradictory information, the hypothesis can be inferred from the premise, as it does not change the original meaning but adds a specific context."
4406,"V egetarian : For overall brand consistency, Amy's is a solid choice and, as a bonus, most of the meals are organic.",None of the food served at Amy's is organic. ,0,0,True,"step 1: in the premise, amy's is described as a vegetarian brand with overall brand consistency and most meals being organic. this implies that amy's is known for its vegetarian food and organic offerings. step 2: the hypothesis states that 'none of the food served at amy's is organic'. this contradicts the information provided in the premise. step 3: based on the logical analysis, the hypothesis cannot be inferred from the premise since the hypothesis contradicts the premise."
4407,"It is named for the presence of many century plants or maguey (""Agave americana"").","It is named for the presence of few century plants or maguey (""Agave americana"").",1,0,False,"step 1. in the premise, 'it is named for the presence of many century plants or maguey' indicates that the name of a certain place or thing is derived from the presence of a large number of century plants or maguey. step 2. the hypothesis 'it is named for the presence of few century plants or maguey' suggests a different explanation for the name, stating that it is derived from the presence of a small number of century plants or maguey. step 3. however, the premise does not contradict the hypothesis. it is possible that the number of century plants or maguey was misrepresented or misunderstood when the name was given. however, without more context or information, it is impossible to definitively say that the hypothesis can be logically inferred from the premise. step 4. since the hypothesis does not logically follow from the premise and there is a possibility of misinformation, it cannot be entailed by the premise."
4408,when i'm fixing dinner or something like that it's i uh at least know if there's anything i want to read thoroughly in the newspaper,When I make dinner I concentrate on only that and nothing else.,0,0,True,"step 1: in the premise, the speaker mentions that when they are fixing dinner, they at least know if there's anything they want to read thoroughly in the newspaper. this implies that they might be multitasking between cooking and reading the newspaper. step 2: in contrast, the hypothesis suggests that when making dinner, the speaker concentrates on only that and nothing else. this contradicts the premise because it implies that the speaker does not engage in any other tasks, such as reading the newspaper, while cooking. step 3: based on the logical analysis, the hypothesis cannot be inferred from the premise as it contradicts the information provided in the premise."
4409,i haven't seen it in a long time but Sesame Street is still really good,I think Sesame Street is a horrible show.,0,0,True,"step 1: in the premise, the speaker expresses a personal opinion that they have not seen sesame street for a long time but still believe it to be good. this is a subjective statement and does not provide any factual information about the quality of sesame street. in the hypothesis, a different speaker expresses an opposite opinion, stating that they think sesame street is a horrible show.step 2: the hypothesis contradicts the premise by providing an opposing viewpoint about the quality of sesame street. while the premise expresses a positive opinion, the hypothesis expresses a negative one.step 3: based on the information provided, the hypothesis cannot be logically inferred from the premise as they present contradictory viewpoints."
4410,TEST SPECIES,The test species are mammalian. ,1,1,True,"step 1: in the premise, no specific information about the type or characteristics of the test species is provided, except for the fact that they are test species. however, it is a well-known fact that mammals are a class of animals. step 2: the hypothesis states that the test species are mammalian. since the known fact that mammals are a class of animals and the hypothesis that the test species belong to this class are logically equivalent, the hypothesis can be considered as a specific instantiation of the premise. step 3: based on the logical equivalence between the premise and hypothesis, the hypothesis is entailed by the premise."
4411,"The town once had a population of 350,000 and some 100 churches.","The town never had more than 200,000 population.",0,0,True,"step 1: in the premise, we have a town with a population of 350,000 and 100 churches. no direct relationship between the population and the number of churches is mentioned, but having a large number of churches might suggest a more stable, longer-term population, as churches often take time and resources to build and maintain. common sense tells us that a large number of churches would not be built to serve a transient population.step 2: the hypothesis contradicts the premise, as the premise states an initial population of 350,000, while the hypothesis states that the population was never above 200,000. a population of 200,000 is less than the initially stated population.step 3: based on the given information and logical principles, the hypothesis cannot be inferred from the premise as it directly contradicts it."
4412,Both France and Finland include the costs of cancellation and mail preparation in counter costs.,France and Findland do not include cancellation costs.,0,0,True,"step 1: in the premise, it is stated that both france and finland include the costs of cancellation and mail preparation in counter costs. this means that these costs are part of the total cost of a transaction or mailing process in both countries.step 2: the hypothesis suggests that france and finland do not include cancellation costs. however, the premise directly contradicts this hypothesis, as it states that both countries do include cancellation costs.step 3: based on the logical negation of the premise, the hypothesis cannot be inferred or logically entailed from the premise."
4413,"But he said he thought the Ledfords understood they could qualify only if he put down a stated income, typically an undocumented business income that raises the borrower's interest rate. ",He thought he didn't need anything to qualify.,0,0,True,"step 1: the premise describes a situation where a person (referred to as 'he') believed that the ledfords could only qualify for a loan if he reported undocumented income. the use of the phrase 'he thought' indicates a belief or perception on his part. step 2: the hypothesis suggests a contrasting belief held by the same person, that he didn't need anything to qualify. this directly contradicts the information given in the premise. step 3: based on the given information, the hypothesis cannot be logically inferred from the premise as they represent contradictory beliefs."
4414,you know back just even fifty years ago when people had had financial problems the fir st place they went to was their family and families took care of themselves and um,"Fifty years ago, no one had any financial problems.",0,0,True,"step 1: in the premise, it is stated that fifty years ago, when people had financial problems, they went to their families for help. this implies that families took care of their own financial issues and supported each other. it does not state that everyone had no financial problems, only that they went to their families when they did.step 2: the hypothesis contradicts the premise as it states that 'no one had any financial problems'. however, the premise suggests otherwise, as it states that people did have financial problems and went to their families for help.step 3: based on the information in the premise, the hypothesis cannot be logically inferred. the premise and hypothesis are contradictory."
4415,actually sent more mail to the U.S. than it received.,Mexicans send more mail here than we send there.,1,0,False,"step 1: in the premise, 'actually, x sent more mail to the u.s. than it received,' the information provided is about the mail exchange between a country x and the u.s. this premise does not disclose the identity of country x. the hypothesis, 'mexicans send more mail here than we send there,' is about the mail exchange between mexico and another country.step 2: to determine if the hypothesis can be logically inferred from the premise, we need to establish a connection between the two. however, there is no clear connection or logical implication. the premise does not provide enough information to support the hypothesis.step 3: based on the given premise and hypothesis, the hypothesis cannot be logically inferred from the premise as there is no direct relationship between the two statements.step 4: it's important to note that the absence of logical entailment does not mean the hypothesis is false, but rather that it cannot be inferred from the given premise alone."
4416,"Watergate remains for many an unhealed wound, and Clinton's critics delight in needling him with Watergate comparisons--whether to Whitewater or Flytrap.",Clinton has several similarities to Whitewater or Flytrap.,1,1,True,"step 1: in the premise, it is mentioned that watergate is an unhealed wound for many, and clinton's critics often compare him to watergate, particularly with regards to whitewater and flytrap. this implies that there are perceived similarities between clinton and watergate or the incidents related to it. step 2: the hypothesis suggests that clinton indeed has similarities to whitewater or flytrap. given the information from the premise, this hypothesis is logically consistent and can be inferred. step 3: based on the logical connection between the premise and hypothesis, and the lack of contradictory information, the hypothesis can be inferred from the premise."
4417,"From this aerie on the rim of the Kathmandu Valley, 322 km (200 miles) of the Himalayas stretch out before you in an immense wall of rock and ice.",The Kathmandu valley directly faces the Himalayas.,1,1,True,"step 1. in the premise, the speaker describes a view from an aerie (perch or nest, often high up) in the kathmandu valley, where they can see 322 km (200 miles) of the himalayas. this implies that the kathmandu valley and the himalayas are in relatively close proximity to each other, with the himalayas being to the north or northeast of the valley based on standard mountain ranges' directions.step 2. the hypothesis states that the kathmandu valley directly faces the himalayas. this can be logically inferred from the premise as the close proximity and the description of the view suggest that the valley is indeed facing the mountains.step 3. based on the logical reasoning and the spatial relationship described in the premise, the hypothesis can be inferred from the premise."
4418,"The wagon train was traveling slow, the wagons riding heavy in the ruts with their burden of northern goods heading south.","The wagon was going really fast north, carrying eastern goods. ",0,0,True,"step 1: in the premise, the wagon train is described as traveling slowly, with wagons riding heavily in ruts and carrying northern goods heading south. this implies that the journey is likely difficult and laborious, and the wagons are carrying a significant load.step 2: in the hypothesis, the wagon is described as going really fast north, carrying eastern goods. this is directly contradictory to the information in the premise. a fast-moving wagon going north with eastern goods is inconsistent with the slow-moving wagon train described in the premise.step 3: based on the logical analysis, the hypothesis cannot be inferred from the premise as they are contradictory statements."
4419,"Leaving the Old City pass through Zion Gate, which is pitted with bullet holes from the 1948 war.",You do not pass Zion Gate when leaving the city.,0,0,True,"step 1: in the premise, it is stated that leaving the old city involves passing through zion gate. the presence of bullet holes in zion gate is described as a result of the 1948 war. step 2: the hypothesis states that one does not pass zion gate when leaving the city, which is directly contrary to the information provided in the premise. step 3: based on the information in the premise, the hypothesis is not logically inferred and in fact contradicts it.step 4: it is important to note that the presence of bullet holes in zion gate may not prevent people from passing through it, and the premise does not suggest that it does. however, the hypothesis as stated would prevent anyone from leaving the city through this gate, which is a significant difference.therefore, based on the given information and logical reasoning, the hypothesis is not entailed by the premise."
4420,Software copyright in China in Chinese Law means that creator or other oblige enjoys exclusive rights of the software under related copyright law.,Software copyright in China in Chinese Law means that creator or identical oblige enjoys exclusive rights of the software under related copyright law.,1,1,True,"step 1: both the premise and hypothesis refer to software copyright in chinese law and the exclusive rights enjoyed by the creator or other obliges. the difference lies in the description of the obliges as 'identical' in the hypothesis. step 2: the term 'identical' does not change the meaning of the premise significantly. in chinese law, the term 'creator or other obliges' is often used interchangeably with 'copyright owner' or 'rights holders'. thus, 'identical obliges' can be understood as synonymous with 'creator or other obliges'. step 3: therefore, the hypothesis can be logically inferred from the premise as both convey the same essential meaning."
4421,This peer group benefited from the opportunity to come together to discuss the challenges and new opportunities created by the processes of state planning.,There were ten people in the peer group.,1,0,False,"step 1: in the premise, there is no specific mention of the number of people in the peer group, only that they came together for a discussion. the premise is about the action and its context, not about the number of individuals involved. step 2: the hypothesis, 'there were ten people in the peer group', is not logically entailed by the premise. the hypothesis adds new information, which is not given in the premise. step 3: the premise does not entail the hypothesis, as the hypothesis makes an assertion about the number of people in the peer group, which is not stated or implied in the premise."
4422,"Ten km (6 miles) from Javea is Denia, with long sandy beaches, a lofty brooding castle and 830 metres (2,500 feet) of Mount Montge to climb.",Mount Montge is over 2 miles high.,0,0,True,"step 1. the premise provides information about javea, denia, and mount montge. the distance between javea and denia is given as 10 km or 6 miles. denia is described as having long sandy beaches, a lofty brooding castle, and 830 metres (2,500 feet) of mount montge to climb. step 2. to determine if the hypothesis can be inferred from the premise, we need to analyze the height of mount montge given in the premise and compare it to the hypothesis. the height of mount montge according to the premise is 830 metres or 2,500 feet. step 3. the hypothesis states that mount montge is over 2 miles high. to convert feet to miles, we divide by 5280. so, 830 feet is approximately equal to 0.157 miles. since 2 miles is 3280.8 feet, mount montge is less than 2 miles high. therefore, the hypothesis cannot be logically inferred from the premise. step 4. it is important to note that a small difference in height or a misunderstanding of units could potentially lead to a false conclusion. in this case, the premise and hypothesis are close but not identical, and the hypothesis is not logically entailed by the premise."
4423,Maybe Wachtler writes cliches because prison has become cliche.,Maybe Wachtler is a writer of cliches because prison in its own right has become cliche in the way the media represents it.,1,1,True,"step 1: the premise suggests a possible explanation for why wachtler writes cliches, implying that there is a connection between the cliches in wachtler's writing and the cliched nature of the representation of prison in the media. step 2: the hypothesis proposes a similar explanation but focuses on prison being cliche in itself, which is consistent with the premise's suggestion. it does not contradict the premise and is a reasonable extension of it, as the media representation of prison can contribute to the overall cliched nature of the topic. step 3: based on the logical consistency between the premise and hypothesis, and the absence of contradictory information, the hypothesis can be inferred from the premise."
4424,Changes in the emissions of SO2 and NOx caused by the Clear Skies Act will change the level of visibility in much of the U.S by reducing concentrations of sulfate and nitrate particles.,Visibility in US cities will be worsened by reducing concentrations of sulfate and nitrate particles.,0,0,True,"step 1: in the premise, it is stated that changes in so2 and nox emissions due to the clear skies act will result in reduced concentrations of sulfate and nitrate particles, leading to improved visibility. common sense and scientific knowledge tell us that sulfate and nitrate particles contribute significantly to air pollution and haze, which can reduce visibility. step 2: the hypothesis, however, suggests that visibility in us cities will be worsened by reducing these particles. this contradicts the information provided in the premise. step 3: based on the given information and logical principles, the hypothesis cannot be logically inferred from the premise. in fact, the premise indicates the opposite of what the hypothesis suggests."
4425,They are sitting with clothes on.,Clothed people are sitting.,1,1,True,"step 1: in the premise, 'they are sitting with clothes on', 'they' refers to a group of people, and 'sitting' means that these people are occupying seats or positions on the ground or other surfaces. 'with clothes on' indicates that these people have clothing covering their bodies. common sense and factual consistency tell us that when people are clothed, they are typically not in the state of being naked. therefore, the premise implies that 'clothed people are sitting'.step 2: the hypothesis 'clothed people are sitting' can be logically inferred from the premise 'they are sitting with clothes on' because the premise already includes the information that people are clothed. the hypothesis is a more specific version of the premise, focusing only on the clothed state and the sitting position.step 3: based on the logical relationship between the premise and hypothesis, common sense understanding, and the absence of contradictory facts, the hypothesis 'clothed people are sitting' can be logically inferred from the premise 'they are sitting with clothes on'."
4426,"Anyway, she was found dead this morning.""",She was still alive.,0,0,True,"step 1: in the premise, the subject 'she' is described as being found dead. this means she is no longer alive. step 2. the hypothesis suggests that 'she was still alive'. this statement directly contradicts the information given in the premise. step 3. based on the logical principle that a dead person cannot be still alive, the hypothesis is not entailed by the premise. step 4. therefore, the label is 0."
4427,"In about a quarter of an hour the bell rang, and Tuppence repaired to the hall to show the visitor out.","After 15 minutes, nothing happened and Tuppence and the visitor decided that it was time to eat some lunch. ",0,0,True,"step 1: in the premise, it is stated that the bell rang and tuppence went to the hall to show the visitor out. this implies that there was a visitor present and that tuppence responded to the bell by letting the visitor in. no information is given about any events that occurred between the time the bell rang and the time tuppence went to the hall. the hypothesis suggests that nothing happened during that time and that tuppence and the visitor decided to eat. this is a possible sequence of events, as people often eat meals after waiting for a while for a guest.step 2: the hypothesis does not directly contradict the premise, as it does not deny anything stated in the premise. however, it does add information that is not explicitly stated in the premise. this is a common scenario in reasoning tasks, where the hypothesis provides additional context or details that are not mentioned in the premise.step 3: to determine if the hypothesis is logically entailed by the premise, we need to consider if the hypothesis follows logically from the information given in the premise. in this case, the hypothesis does not directly follow from the premise, as the premise does not mention anything about tuppence and the visitor eating. however, it is not contradictory to the premise, either. the hypothesis could be a plausible explanation for what happened between the time the bell rang and the time tuppence went to the hall.step 4: based on the given information, logical principles, and common-sense reasoning, the hypothesis is not logically entailed by the premise, as it adds information that is not explicitly stated in the premise. however, it is a plausible scenario that could have occurred based on the information provided in the premise."
4428,These provisions authorize the FCC to make such rules and regulations as may be necessary to encourage more effective use of radio as in the public interest.,The FCC always abuses their power to make rules regarding the use of radio.,1,0,False,"step 1: the premise states that the fcc has the authority to make rules and regulations concerning radio use in the public interest. this implies that the fcc has the power to enact rules to promote efficient radio use. there is no mentioned information about any past misuse of this power.step 2: the hypothesis alleges that the fcc always abuses their power. this is a strong claim that cannot be directly inferred from the premise. the premise neither states nor implies that the fcc has always abused their power.step 3: based on the given information, the hypothesis is not entailed by the premise. the premise only establishes the fcc's power to enact rules, and it does not provide any information about their past actions or behavior."
4429,and i don't know if they make landscape ties that aren't treated,I know they make landscape ties that aren't treated,0,0,True,"step 1: in the premise, the speaker expresses uncertainty about whether untreated landscape ties exist. the hypothesis, on the other hand, asserts a positive statement that untreated landscape ties do exist. step 2: the hypothesis does not logically follow from the premise, as the premise does not provide enough information to infer that untreated landscape ties exist. however, the hypothesis is not contradictory to the premise either. step 3: based on the lack of logical connection and the absence of contradiction, the hypothesis is not entailed by the premise."

4431,i'm from California  my mom the last time i was like purchased a gun my  my mom was getting a rifle for my brother that he wanted like an antique one  and,My mother refused to buy a gun for my brother.,0,0,True,"step 1: in the premise, it is mentioned that my mom bought a gun for my brother. the specific gun is described as an 'antique one'. no information is given about my brother's desire for the gun or my mother's reasons for buying it. step 2: the hypothesis states that my mother 'refused' to buy a gun for my brother. this directly contradicts the information provided in the premise. step 3: based on the contradiction, the hypothesis cannot be logically inferred from the premise."
4432,and he uh i don't think he didn't apply i don't think he'd get admitted there but he's starting to get enough motivated he wants to go there that i think he'll go to Richland and take what he needs to have to take to qualify in Tech and then try to go to Tech the next year,He is doomed to be a failure. ,0,0,True,"step 1: in the premise, the speaker discusses a person's desire to go to a specific school (tech) and the steps they are taking to qualify and eventually attend. no information is provided about any failures or lack of success the person has experienced.step 2: the hypothesis 'he is doomed to be a failure' contradicts the information in the premise. the premise indicates the person's motivation and actions towards achieving their goal, and nothing suggests that they are destined for failure.step 3: based on the logical reasoning that the hypothesis contradicts the premise and lacks factual support, the hypothesis is not entailed by the premise."
4433,"Your credibility begins when you open your mouth, she said. ",A person's credibility begins when they sign their name on a contract.,0,0,True,"step 1: the premise refers to the starting point of a person's credibility being established through their speech. it is a figurative statement, suggesting that a person's trustworthiness is demonstrated as soon as they begin speaking. step 2: the hypothesis proposes a different starting point for credibility, one that is linked to signing a contract. these two statements describe different situations. step 3: since the premise and hypothesis describe distinct scenarios, it is not logical to infer the hypothesis from the premise. the hypothesis cannot be entailed by the premise."

4437,uh-huh and i was losing jobs just from doing a poor job you know,I should have done better since I would have retained my jobs.,1,1,True,"step 1: in the premise, the speaker admits to losing jobs due to poor performance. this implies that if they had performed better, they would have kept their jobs. common sense and logical reasoning suggest that a cause of losing a job is not performing well, and that performing better would result in keeping the job. step 2: the hypothesis 'i should have done better since i would have retained my jobs' is logically consistent with the premise, as it is an immediate consequence of the stated facts. step 3: based on the logical connection between the premise and hypothesis, common sense understanding, and lack of contradictory information, the hypothesis can be inferred from the premise."
4438,A 1997 Henry J. Kaiser Family Foundation survey found that Americans in managed care plans are basically content with their own care.,The henry kaiser foundation shows that people will always be content with how their healthcare is,1,0,False,"step 1: in the premise, the henry j. kaiser foundation conducted a survey in 1997 and found that americans in managed care plans were content with their own care. this implies a specific situation where people's satisfaction with their healthcare was assessed and a majority expressed contentment. step 2: the hypothesis, however, generalizes the findings from the premise by stating that 'people will always be content with how their healthcare is.' this is a significant leap and assumes that the contentment expressed in the survey is a universal truth for all people and all situations. step 3: the hypothesis cannot be logically inferred from the premise, as the premise only describes a particular survey result, and there is no evidence or logical reason to assume that people will always be content with their healthcare. additionally, common sense and real-world experience suggest that people's satisfaction with their healthcare can vary greatly depending on their individual circumstances and needs."
4439," ""Die!"" the one in front yelled.","The one in front yelled, and reached for his gun on the ground.",1,0,False,"step 1: the premise describes an action, 'yelled', performed by 'the one in front'. this action could be motivated by various reasons, and there's no explicit information about what 'die!' means in this context. it could be a threat, a command, or a mere exclamation. it does not imply any action concerning a gun.step 2: the hypothesis adds an additional action, 'reached for his gun on the ground'. there is no causal connection or implication of this action from the premise. the premise does not provide any information about the reason for the yell, nor does it indicate the presence of a gun or any action involving it.step 3: based on the information provided, the hypothesis cannot be logically inferred from the premise. the premise does not provide sufficient information to infer the hypothesis."
4440,yeah yeah yeah you know it's it's interesting that that a lot of the population in the United States is changing because you know uh now that so many more minorities where they have had extended families for such a long time,The population has not changed at all over the years. ,0,0,True,"step 1. in the premise, it is stated that 'the population in the united states is changing' because 'now that so many more minorities' have been integrating into society and forming extended families. this implies that there is a demographic shift happening in the us population.step 2. the hypothesis asserts that 'the population has not changed at all over the years.' this directly contradicts the premise as it states an opposite fact.step 3. based on the logical negation of the premise in the hypothesis, it is clear that the hypothesis is not entailed by the premise.step 4. common sense and factual knowledge also indicate that the hypothesis is not true, as there is ample evidence showing demographic changes in the us population over the years.therefore, the hypothesis 'the population has not changed at all over the years' is not logically entailed by the premise 'yeah yeah yeah you know it's it's interesting that that a lot of the population in the united states is changing because you know uh now that so many more minorities have had extended families for such a long time'."
4441,so i how do you feel that it should be applied,I really need your help with figuring out how to apply this.,1,0,False,"step 1: in the premise, there is a first-person speaker expressing their feelings about 'how it should be applied'. the speaker's statement does not provide explicit information about what 'it' refers to, nor does it provide any context or conditions for application. in the hypothesis, the speaker is seeking help in figuring out the application of 'it'.step 2: the hypothesis does not logically follow from the premise because the premise does not offer any information about what 'it' is or how it should be applied. the hypothesis only indicates a need for help in understanding the application.step 3: based on the given information, the hypothesis is not entailed by the premise as there is no logical connection between the two statements."

",I've always been very well adjusted to creating a specific environment.,1,1,True,"step 1: in the premise, the speaker expresses their ability to create an 'atmosphere'. the term 'atmosphere' refers to the environment or mood that surrounds a person or a place. this ability is described as a skill that the speaker has had for a long time.step 2: the hypothesis, 'i've always been very well adjusted to creating a specific environment', is a statement that can be logically inferred from the premise. the phrase 'well adjusted' means that someone has adapted to a situation effectively. in this context, the situation is 'creating a specific environment' or 'creating an atmosphere'. since the premise already establishes that the speaker has had this skill for a long time, it follows logically that they have been well-adjusted to it.step 3: based on the logical reasoning and the semantic similarity between the terms 'atmosphere' and 'environment', the hypothesis is a specific, detailed version of the ability already described in the premise. therefore, the hypothesis is entailed by the premise."
4443,8 billion pieces of advertising mail.,A very little number of pieces of advertising mail.,0,0,True,"step 1: the premise states that there are 8 billion pieces of advertising mail. this is a large number, indicating a significant quantity. step 2: the hypothesis states that 'a very little number' of pieces of advertising mail exist. this is a direct contradiction to the premise, as 'a very little number' implies a small or negligible quantity, which is the opposite of '8 billion' which represents a large quantity. step 3: based on the contradiction between the premise and hypothesis, it is clear that the hypothesis cannot be logically inferred from the premise."

4445,Stairways and railings just inside the gate make a tour of the battlements safe.,"Touring the battlements is not safe, due to the fact that there are no railings or stairways. ",0,0,True,"step 1: in the premise, it is stated that the presence of stairways and railings makes touring the battlements safe. this implies that the battlements can be dangerous without these safety features. step 2: in contrast, the hypothesis states that touring the battlements is not safe due to the absence of stairways and railings. this contradicts the premise as it suggests a different safety condition. step 3: based on the logical contradiction and the lack of evidence to support the hypothesis in the given context, it is not entailed by the premise.step 4: it is important to note that the hypothesis may still be true or false depending on other factors not mentioned in the premise or hypothesis. for example, there could be other hazards present at the battlements that make it unsafe regardless of the presence or absence of stairways and railings."

4450,"Larsen left BNA in 2009, in favor of Treehouse Records and consequently with Stroudavarious Records, but is now unsigned.","Larsen left BNA in 2000, in favor of Treehouse Records and consequently with Stroudavarious Records, but is now unsigned.",0,0,True,"step 1. in the premise, larsen is stated to have left bna in 2009, joined treehouse records and stroudavarious records, but is now unsigned. step 2. the hypothesis suggests a different year (2000) for larsen's departure from bna, keeping the same records labels and current status. however, the premise provides no factual evidence that indicates the year 2000 as the actual year, it only states that as a hypothesis is incorrect. step 3. based on the given information, the hypothesis 'larsen left bna in 2000' cannot be logically inferred from the premise 'larsen left bna in 2009'. the premise does not provide enough evidence or logical connection to support the hypothesis."
4451,and the buying a house was the last thing that i wanted to do,"I didn't want to buy a house, but I decided I should bite the bullet and do it.",1,1,True,"step 1: in the premise, the speaker expresses their initial reluctance to buy a house. this indicates a lack of desire or willingness to undertake this action. in the hypothesis, the speaker acknowledges their initial reluctance but also mentions a decision to go against it and buy the house despite that.step 2: the hypothesis can be logically inferred from the premise because it does not contradict it. the premise only states that the speaker didn't want to buy a house, it does not state that they couldn't or wouldn't change their mind. the hypothesis explains a possible reason for the speaker's eventual decision to buy a house - they decided they should do it despite their initial reluctance.step 3: based on the logical reasoning, the hypothesis can be inferred from the premise as it does not contradict it and provides a plausible explanation for the speaker's actions."
4452,"While the SEC found that it would be inconsistent with the Coordination Act to grant an exemption for the above-described small entities, the Commissioner has written to the congressional committees concerned urging that the sunset provision be eliminated and the ERISA exemption be made permanent.","The SEC is merely concerned with upholding the law, but the Commissioner has an ax to grind with SEC.",1,0,False,"step 1: in the premise, the sec found it inconsistent with the coordination act to grant an exemption for small entities, but the commissioner wrote to congressional committees urging the elimination of the sunset provision and the permanent extension of the erisa exemption. the sec is an independent federal agency responsible for enforcing securities laws, while the commissioner is an individual acting within the sec. the premise indicates that the sec follows the laws, while the commissioner advocates for a change in the law. step 2: the hypothesis suggests that the commissioner has a personal bias against the sec, which is not indicated in the premise. there is no information provided that would logically lead to this conclusion. step 3: based on the information provided in the premise, the hypothesis that 'the commissioner has an ax to grind with the sec' cannot be logically inferred. the premise does not suggest any personal biases or conflicts of interest, and the hypothesis goes beyond the facts provided."
4454,they're married in real life,Actually they are both gay and married to other people.,0,0,True,"step 1: in the premise, it is stated that 'they' are married in real life. this is a factual statement about their marital status. the hypothesis, on the other hand, makes a claim about their sexual orientation and their marital status to other people. step 2: there is no logical connection between the premise and the hypothesis. the fact that 'they' are married in real life does not entail or logically imply that they are both gay or married to other people. step 3: based on the given information, the hypothesis cannot be logically inferred from the premise. the hypothesis introduces new information that contradicts the known fact stated in the premise. therefore, the hypothesis is not entailed by the premise."

White crossed his arms.",White was upset that they had changed their plan and not told you.,1,1,True,"step 1: in the premise, 'they' refers to individuals who were expected to arrive at a later time but came earlier. white's reaction, 'crossed his arms', suggests displeasure or anger. step 2: the hypothesis proposes that white was upset because of a change in plans. this hypothesis can be logically inferred from the premise, as the premise implies that a change in plans occurred without being communicated, which would be a reasonable cause for white's upset reaction. step 3: based on the logical reasoning and the information provided, the hypothesis is entailed by the premise."
4456,Both emissions count in achieving the goal of recovery.,Only one emission will count towards the goal of recovery.,0,0,True,"step 1: in the premise, 'both emissions' are stated as contributing to the goal of recovery. the goal here is not explicitly defined, but it can be inferred that 'recovery' refers to a desirable state or outcome. step 2: the hypothesis suggests that 'only one emission' would count towards this goal, implying that the other emission would not. this contradicts the information in the premise, as the premise states that 'both emissions' count towards the goal. step 3: based on the logical inconsistency between the premise and hypothesis, it cannot be logically inferred that the hypothesis is entailed by the premise."
4457,i mean that would be great,That is not a good idea.,0,0,True,"step 1: in the premise, there is no clear statement or implication of a specific idea or action being suggested as 'great'. it is a subjective statement that expresses a desire or preference. in contrast, the hypothesis is a statement that expresses a negative opinion or evaluation.step 2: 'that is not a good idea' cannot be logically inferred from 'i mean that would be great'. the hypothesis contradicts the premise, as they have opposite meanings.step 3: based on the logical analysis, the hypothesis is not entailed by the premise. in fact, they are contradictory."
4458,It couldn' There was no away.,The topic couldn't be avoided.,1,1,True,"step 1: the premise 'it couldn't there be away' is a colloquial way of expressing that there was no escape or solution to a situation. it implies a complete lack of alternatives or options.step 2: the hypothesis 'the topic couldn't be avoided' holds a similar meaning. it means that the topic could not be evaded or eluded, suggesting a situation where all attempts to change the subject or ignore the issue were futile.step 3: given the similar meanings of the premise and hypothesis, it can be inferred that the hypothesis is entailed by the premise. both statements express that there was no possibility to change the subject or situation.step 4: the hypothesis can be logically derived from the premise since it is a more specific version of the premise. the hypothesis focuses on the topic being unavoided, which is an essential part of the situation described in the premise.therefore, the hypothesis is logically entailed by the premise."

4463,"The dust fills a man's lungs, stealing years off of his life.",The dust from the desert sand can fill your lungs and kill you. ,1,1,True,"step 1: in the premise, 'dust fills a man's lungs, stealing years off of his life', the key information is that dust negatively impacts a man's health by entering his lungs. this implies that the dust is harmful and capable of causing damage. step 2: in the hypothesis, 'the dust from the desert sand can fill your lungs and kill you', the hypothesis posits that desert sand dust is harmful and can cause death by entering a person's lungs. this is logically consistent with the premise as the harmful property of the dust is the central idea in both statements. the hypothesis can be seen as a more generalized version of the premise, where the man is replaced with a more abstract 'you'. step 3: based on the logical consistency and the central idea shared between the premise and hypothesis, the hypothesis can be inferred from the premise."
4465,"Water rushed down my throat, tasting of salt.",I thought that I was going to drown.,1,1,True,"step 1: in the premise, the person is experiencing the sensation of water rushing down their throat and tasting salt. this is likely due to inhaling water, a common symptom of drowning. the premise does not directly state that the person was drowning, but the described sensation strongly suggests it. step 2: in the hypothesis, the person is expressing their thought or fear that they are drowning. this thought or fear is a logical consequence of the situation described in the premise. step 3: based on the logical connection between the premise and hypothesis, the hypothesis can be inferred from the premise."
4466,"Wright 's morning glory, is a species of morning glory.","Ipomea wrightii, or Wright's morning glory, is a species of morning glory.",1,1,True,"step 1. both the premise and hypothesis describe the same species of morning glory, wright's morning glory or ipomea wrightii. they are identical in meaning.step 2. the hypothesis is a specific instance of the general description given in the premise. the hypothesis expands the premise with a more explicit naming of the species.step 3. given the semantic identity of the premise and hypothesis, and the logical relationship where the hypothesis is a more specific instance of the premise, the hypothesis is entailed by the premise."
4468,Human nature puts Clinton at a disadvantage in this debate.,Human nature puts Clinton at a disadvantage in this debate but he will pull through.,1,0,False,"step 1: in the premise, 'human nature' is referred to as a factor putting clinton at a disadvantage during the debate. this could mean that there are certain characteristics or tendencies inherent in humans that might work against clinton. the hypothesis adds that clinton will 'pull through' despite this disadvantage, implying resilience or the ability to overcome adversity.step 2: the hypothesis does not contradict the premise, as it acknowledges the presence of the disadvantage while also suggesting a possible outcome. however, the hypothesis goes beyond the information provided in the premise by implying a positive outcome.step 3: while it's not impossible for someone to overcome a disadvantage, the premise itself does not provide sufficient information to logically infer that clinton will pull through. the hypothesis introduces an additional piece of information that is not entailed by the premise.step 4: based on the logical analysis, the hypothesis cannot be logically inferred from the premise since it introduces new information that goes beyond the given context."
4469,"At LSC Board meetings, local events and national conferences, we showcased exemplary planning and implementation.","At LSC board meetings, we showed how we could help everyone in the community.",1,1,True,"step 1: in the premise, it is stated that at lsc (local school council) board meetings, exemplary planning and implementation were showcased. this implies that the lsc was effectively managing and executing their responsibilities. step 2: the hypothesis suggests that at lsc board meetings, they showed how they could help the entire community. this can be logically inferred from the premise, as showcasing exemplary planning and implementation implies a positive impact and desire to contribute to the community. step 3: based on the logical connection between the premise and hypothesis, and the common sense understanding that effective management and implementation of responsibilities would involve benefiting the community, the hypothesis is a logical entailment of the premise."
4470,"But if smoking is addictive, then it makes sense to try to keep tobacco out of the hands of kids who are too young to take the warnings seriously.",It doesn't make sense to try to keep cigarettes away from children if they are going to try smoking them anyways.,0,0,True,"step 1. the premise acknowledges that smoking is addictive and suggests a reason for trying to prevent children from accessing tobacco. the hypothesis challenges this reasoning, suggesting that it is unnecessary to keep cigarettes away from children if they are going to try smoking them anyways. step 2. the hypothesis doesn't contradict the premise directly, but it does challenge the reasoning behind the stated action. it is true that some children may try smoking despite efforts to prevent it, but this doesn't negate the potential harm of smoking or the importance of reducing access to tobacco products, especially for children. step 3. the hypothesis doesn't logically follow from the premise, as it does not address the underlying reasons for the stated action. while it is true that some children may ignore warnings and try smoking, it is still important to minimize their exposure to tobacco and the risks associated with it. therefore, the hypothesis is not entailed by the premise."
4471,I hate to feel that I have to explain myself more fully.,I enjoy having to explain myself more clearly.,0,0,True,"step 1: the premise expresses a dislike or aversion towards having to explain oneself more fully, which may imply some level of inconvenience or discomfort. it does not provide any information about the speaker's feelings towards the clarity of their explanations.step 2: the hypothesis suggests a contrasting sentiment - a positive enjoyment or pleasure in having to explain oneself more clearly. this implies a different emotional response to the act of explaining.step 3: there is no direct logical connection between the premise and the hypothesis. the premise does not entail the hypothesis, as hating to explain oneself more fully does not necessarily mean that one enjoys doing so more clearly.therefore, the hypothesis cannot be logically inferred from the premise."
4472,um-hum are you afraid they'd get stolen or run away or,I mean it's not like they could just up and walk away.,1,1,True,"step 1: in the premise, the speaker is expressing concern about the possibility of 'um-hum' (presumably objects or animals) being stolen or running away. this implies that the speaker values these items or animals and wants to prevent their loss.step 2: the hypothesis expresses a sense of resignation that 'they' (presumably the same 'um-hum' as in the premise) cannot just 'up and walk away.' it indicates a recognition that the speaker has no control over the objects or animals leaving.step 3: the hypothesis can be inferred from the premise because the speaker's concern about theft or running away implies that they recognize that the 'um-hum' have the ability to move or be taken away against the speaker's will. the hypothesis acknowledges this reality and emphasizes the speaker's lack of control.step 4: while the hypothesis does not directly state that the 'um-hum' cannot be prevented from leaving, its implication - that the speaker has no power to stop them - is a logical consequence of the premise, which expresses the speaker's fear of this very outcome.thus, the hypothesis is a logical inference from the premise, as it acknowledges and expands upon the implications of the speaker's concern in the premise."
4473,"(And, incidentally, sneering comparisons are a big part of the next round of SATs.",The addition of comparisons is new to the SATs.,1,0,False,"step 1: analyzing the premise, it mentions 'incidentally' and 'sneering comparisons' being a part of the next round of sats. this implies that comparisons have been present in some form in previous sats, but the sneering nature is a new element. step 2: contrasting the hypothesis with the premise, the hypothesis asserts that the 'addition' of comparisons is new to the sats, which is not exactly the same as the premise. however, the premise does suggest that the nature of the comparisons is changing, so there might be some truth to the hypothesis. step 3: to determine entailment, we need to understand if the hypothesis is a logical consequence of the premise. the hypothesis implies a change in the nature of comparisons in the sats, but the premise does not explicitly state that there are no comparisons in the current sats or that the nature of comparisons remains the same. additionally, the word 'addition' in the hypothesis might not be accurate since the premise mentions that comparisons have always been a part of the sats in some form.therefore, based on the given information, the hypothesis is not logically entailed by the premise. the hypothesis makes a specific claim about a change in the nature of comparisons, while the premise only implies that the nature of comparisons is changing in some way. the hypothesis could be true, but it is not a necessary conclusion from the given premise."
4474,The title character was played by Frank H. Crane.,"The title character was played by Frank H. Crane, but the production credits are largely unknown.",1,1,True,"step 1: in the premise, it is stated that frank h. crane played the title character. this is a clear factual statement. the hypothesis also mentions that frank h. crane played the title character, but it adds that the production credits are largely unknown. this additional information does not contradict the premise.step 2: the hypothesis can be logically inferred from the premise, as the premise establishes that frank h. crane was the actor for the title character, and the hypothesis repeats this information.step 3: based on the logical relationship between the premise and hypothesis, and the absence of contradictory information, the hypothesis is entailed by the premise."
4475,This would clearly be contrary to the role that Congress has established for GAO.,Congress had very narrow intentions for the scope of GAO's role.,1,0,False,"step 1: in the premise, it is stated that the given action would be contrary to the role that congress has established for gao. this implies that there is an expected or established role for gao that this action would deviate from. the context suggests that this role is one of oversight or investigation in some capacity, but the details are not provided.step 2: the hypothesis proposes a narrow intention for the scope of gao's role. while not contradictory to the premise on its own, it could potentially explain the scenario described in the premise as consistent with congress's intentions, depending on the specifics of what the scope of gao's role is and how the given action would deviate from it.step 3: however, without further context or information about the specifics of gao's role and the nature of the given action, it is not possible to definitively determine if the hypothesis is entailed by the premise or not. the premise only informs us of the general idea that the given action is contrary to the role that congress has established for gao, but it does not provide sufficient detail to infer the specifics of that role or the nature of the given action. therefore, we cannot determine if the hypothesis is a logical inference from the premise based on the given information alone."
4476,He had no real answer.,He didn't have the answer to the question I posed.,1,1,True,"step 1: in the premise, 'he had no real answer' implies that the person did not provide a satisfactory or accurate response to a question. the hypothesis, 'he didn't have the answer to the question i posed', directly relates to the premise as it states that the person in question did not have an answer to a specific question.step 2: the hypothesis can be logically inferred from the premise because the premise establishes that the person lacked a satisfactory response, and the hypothesis specifies that this lack of response was due to not having the answer to the question posed.step 3: based on the logical relationship between the premise and hypothesis, the hypothesis is a logical entailment of the premise."
4477,The album was gold in Australia.,"The album was certified silver in the UK, and gold in Australia.",1,0,False,"step 1: in the premise, it is stated that the album was 'gold' in australia, which refers to a certification level for album sales. this implies a significant level of sales in australia. step 2: the hypothesis states that the album was 'certified silver' in the uk and 'gold' in australia. the fact that the album was certified 'gold' in australia aligns with the premise. 'certified silver' in the uk implies a lower level of sales compared to 'gold' certification. however, the hypothesis does not contradict the premise as it is possible for an album to have different certification levels in different regions. step 3: while the hypothesis can't be logically inferred directly from the premise, it does not contradict it, and it is a reasonable assumption that an album could have different certification levels in different regions. therefore, the hypothesis is not entailed by the premise, but it is not a contradiction either."
4478,"You'll just have to speak to Red, dear, and make him promise not to do things in the kitchen any more.",Red is unaware of any new rules on kitchen use.,1,0,False,"step 1: in the premise, it is suggested that the speaker intends to have a conversation with red regarding his behavior in the kitchen and asking him to abstain from certain actions. this implies that there are new rules or expectations regarding kitchen use. however, the premise does not provide any explicit information about red's awareness or lack thereof. step 2: the hypothesis suggests that red is unaware of the new rules. this is not directly contradictory to the information in the premise, but it is not logically entailed either. it is possible that red is aware of the new rules but has not yet complied with them, or that he is simply being given a reminder or warning. step 3: based on the given information, it is not possible to definitively determine if the hypothesis is entailed by the premise or not. the premise does not provide sufficient information to logically infer that red is unaware of the new rules."
4479,"The almaz is said to have magical powers residing in its hair, but if the hair is removed grabbed, it may be rendered helpless.","The almaz is said to have magical powers residing in its hair, but if the hair is removed or even grabbed, it may be rendered helpless.",1,1,True,"step 1: in the premise, it is stated that the almaz has magical powers that reside in its hair, and that removing or grabbing the hair may render it helpless. this implies that the almaz's magical abilities are closely linked to its hair.step 2: the hypothesis exactly matches the information in the premise, with no additional or contradictory statements. the hypothesis reiterates the same conditions regarding the almaz's magical powers and their association with its hair being removed or grabbed.step 3: since the hypothesis is an exact restatement of the premise, and there is no contradictory or new information in the hypothesis, it can be logically inferred from the premise.step 4: the hypothesis is an entailment of the premise, as it contains all the information in the premise and does not add or contradict any details.label: 1"
4480,"I've been shaving my face for years now, and I should know it.",I have never bothered to shave.,0,0,True,"step 1: in the premise, the speaker asserts that they have been shaving their face 'for years now', indicating a regular habit or routine. this implies a familiarity and comfort with the act of shaving. step 2: the hypothesis states that the speaker 'has never bothered to shave', which directly contradicts the premise. step 3: based on the given information, the hypothesis is not entailed by the premise as they are logically incompatible."
4481,Black greyhound dog racing down a track.,The dog is on the track.,1,1,True,"step 1: in the premise, a black greyhound dog is described as racing down a track. a track is a defined path or surface designed for racing or competition. the presence of a track implies that the dog is indeed on the track, as racing involves moving along the track. common sense also supports this, as it is the usual and expected location for a dog engaged in a race. step 2: the hypothesis 'the dog is on the track' is an exact statement that can be logically inferred from the premise 'black greyhound dog racing down a track'. step 3: based on the logical connection between the premise and hypothesis, the hypothesis is entailed by the premise."
4482,okay in one part the guy goes out of jail and within uh two months he had all his house payments done everything paid and you know and he had enough money to you know it's like,"In one part, the guy gets out of jail and he has to sell his house for money.",0,0,True,"step 1: the premise describes a situation where a guy pays off all his house payments within two months after getting out of jail and has enough money left. this implies that he had sufficient funds to pay off his debts and save some money. step 2: the hypothesis suggests that the guy had to sell his house for money. this is not logically entailed by the premise, as the premise mentions the guy having enough money, but it does not explicitly state that he sold his house. step 3: based on the given information, the hypothesis cannot be logically inferred from the premise, as there is no clear connection between the premise and the hypothesis."
4483,But you won't find it so easy to knock this country and its great corporations with the sort of left-wing philosophy best expressed on a bumper sticker when you don't even have a bumper!,It's always easy to criticize a country regardless of bumpers. ,0,0,True,"step 1. in the premise, the author expresses a challenge to criticizing a country and its corporations without having a 'bumper' or a platform to express left-wing philosophy. this implies that the author believes it requires some level of commitment or investment to make such criticisms.step 2. the hypothesis suggests that criticizing a country is always easy, regardless of having a 'bumper' or not. this directly contradicts the premise, as the author's perspective in the premise is that criticizing requires some level of investment or commitment.step 3. based on the logical inconsistency between the premise and hypothesis, it is clear that the hypothesis cannot be inferred from the premise.step 4. the hypothesis's assertion that criticizing a country is always easy is a generalization that contradicts the specific perspective presented in the premise. therefore, the hypothesis is not entailed by the premise."
4484,there is a strong undercurrent of Hinduism with its distinct priestly class.,"The main religion practiced in Thailand is Buddhism, but there is a strong undercurrent of Hinduism with its distinct priestly class.",1,1,True,"step 1: in the premise, it is mentioned that there is a strong undercurrent of hinduism in the religious context of a certain place (implicitly identified as india, based on the reference to a 'priestly class'). hinduism and buddhism are two distinct but interconnected religions originating from the indian subcontinent. they share many cultural and philosophical similarities, but hinduism includes a complex hierarchy of gods, goddesses, and various spiritual practices, while buddhism is centered around the teachings of siddhartha gautama, known as the buddha. in this context, the presence of a 'distinct priestly class' could be indicative of the religious practices and structures associated with hinduism.step 2: the hypothesis states that buddhism is the main religion in thailand, but there is also a strong undercurrent of hinduism with its distinct priestly class. this means that buddhism is the dominant religious practice, while hinduism, in some form or another, still plays a significant role in the religious landscape of thailand. the presence of a 'distinct priestly class' again suggests the influence of hinduism.step 3: given the information provided, it can be logically inferred that the presence of a strong undercurrent of hinduism with its distinct priestly class does not contradict the fact that buddhism is the main religion in thailand. instead, it demonstrates the complex interplay of religious influences in the region. the hypothesis can be seen as a more specific, nuanced explanation of the religious situation in thailand, rather than a contradiction of the premise.step 4: in conclusion, the hypothesis can be seen as a logical extension and elaboration of the premise. it is not a contradiction but a more detailed elaboration of the religious landscape described in the premise."
4485,"There is a curious antiquarian feeling, in fact, to the whole leering enterprise, says The New Yorker 's Anthony Lane.",Anthony Lane found it dingy and too modern. ,0,0,True,"step 1: in the premise, anthony lane's feelings towards 'the whole leering enterprise' are described as curious and antiquarian. this implies that he finds something old-fashioned or charming about the enterprise, despite the negative connotation of 'leering'. step 2: in contrast, the hypothesis states that anthony lane found it dingy and too modern. this is a contradiction with the information given in the premise, as 'dingy' suggests old and run-down, which is inconsistent with the 'curious' and 'antiquarian' feelings described in the premise. also, 'too modern' contradicts the sense of old-fashionedness or charm implied in 'antiquarian'. step 3: based on the contradiction between the premise and hypothesis, the hypothesis cannot be logically inferred from the premise."
4486,A shirtless man is cooking on an outdoor grill.,Someone is using a microwave.,0,0,True,"step 1: in the premise, a man is identified as cooking on an outdoor grill. cooking on a grill is a process that typically involves heating food over an open flame or coals. this is a common way to prepare food outdoors, but it is not the only way. step 2: the hypothesis suggests that 'someone' is using a microwave. a microwave is an appliance used to heat or cook food by using electromagnetic waves. this method of cooking is quite different from cooking on a grill as it does not involve an open flame or heat source. step 3: the hypothesis cannot be logically inferred from the premise as there is no information in the premise suggesting the use of a microwave. the presence of a man cooking on a grill does not entail the existence or use of a microwave."
4487,"The EPA has cited sections 202, 206, 208 and 301 of the Clean Air Act, as amended.",The EPA does not announce amendments.,0,0,True,"step 1: in the premise, the epa is identified as having cited specific sections of the clean air act. the clean air act is a law, and amendments to a law are changes to that law. citing sections of a law does not imply announcing amendments, but rather acknowledging the existing regulations. step 2: the hypothesis, 'the epa does not announce amendments', is not logically inferred from the premise. while citing sections of a law does not imply an announcement of amendments, it also does not contradict such an announcement. the premise is silent on the epa's announcement of amendments. step 3: based on the given information, there is no entailment relationship between the premise and the hypothesis."
4488,Wait a second!,Wait a second before you go.,1,1,True,"step 1: the premise and hypothesis are both phrases that mean asking for a moment's pause before an action is taken. they convey the same meaning, albeit in slightly different contexts. this semantic similarity suggests a logical connection between the two statements.step 2: the hypothesis can be logically inferred from the premise because the second part of the hypothesis ('before you go') specifies the context in which the action of waiting should occur. this is similar to the context indicated in the premise ('wait a second').step 3: based on semantic similarity and the logical relationship between the two statements, the hypothesis can be inferred from the premise."
4489,"Thanks to this, musicians can practice with headphones without disturbing people around them, or obtain an acoustic tone under heavy amplification without feedback.","Thanks to this, musicians can practice with headphones without disturbing people around them, or obtain an acoustic tone under thin amplification without feedback.",1,1,True,"step 1: in the premise, 'this' refers to a specific device or technology, such as noise-cancelling headphones or a particular type of amplifier, which allows musicians to practice with headphones quietly and achieve an acoustic tone under heavy amplification without feedback. step 2: the hypothesis also refers to 'this', indicating the same device or technology. the conditions mentioned in the hypothesis - practicing with headphones quietly and obtaining an acoustic tone under thin amplification without feedback - are logically consistent with the conditions mentioned in the premise - practicing with headphones quietly and obtaining an acoustic tone under heavy amplification without feedback. it is reasonable to assume that the device or technology is capable of enabling both scenarios. step  3: based on the logical consistency of the conditions, the hypothesis can be inferred from the premise."
4490,"Its main claim to fame is that it contains the world's largest hand-made carpet (guided tours only, 9:30 a.m. 5:00 p.m. , closed Monday and Thursday).",The art museum received the hand made carpet as a gift twenty years ago.,1,0,False,"step 1: the premise states that the museum's main claim to fame is the world's largest hand-made carpet and provides some information about visiting hours. it does not mention anything about how or when the museum acquired the carpet. step 2: the hypothesis suggests that the museum received the hand-made carpet as a gift twenty years ago. this information is not directly stated or logically deducible from the premise. step 3: based on the given information in the premise, it is not possible to logically infer the hypothesis. the hypothesis introduces new information that is not mentioned or implied in the premise."
4491,Mihychuk resigned to run for Mayor of Winnipeg in 2004.,"Mihychuk resigned to run for Mayor of Winnipeg in 2004, but was defeated by Sam Katz.",1,0,False,"step 1: in the premise, mihychuk is stated to have resigned to run for mayor of winnipeg in 2004. this implies an attempt to be elected to the mayoral position. step 2: the hypothesis suggests that mihychuk was defeated in his mayoral campaign by sam katz after resigning. this is a possible outcome for someone who has run for public office but is not a contradiction to the premise. step 3: although the premise does not explicitly state the outcome of the election, it does not contradict the hypothesis. in fact, the hypothesis adds additional information about the election result, which could be considered true if it aligns with the historical record. step 4: to determine if the hypothesis is entailed by the premise, it would be necessary to have factual information indicating that mihychuk was indeed defeated by sam katz in the 2004 winnipeg mayoral election. in the absence of such information, the premise does not logically entail the hypothesis, but it does not contradict it either.step 5: given the available information, it is impossible to definitively determine if the hypothesis is entailed by the premise or not. there might be other factors influencing the election outcome that are not mentioned in either the premise or the hypothesis. therefore, it is not appropriate to assign a label of '1' for entailment based on this information alone.label: 0"
4493,The side of the train was getting smoother and smoother- soon there'd be no place left to hold on.,There would be no more rope to hold on to in a few minutes. ,1,1,True,"step 1: in the premise, the side of the train is getting smoother and smoother, suggesting a decrease in surface roughness. this could mean that the train is gaining speed, making it increasingly difficult to hold on. no specific mention of ropes is made in the premise, but given the context of holding on and the train's condition, it's reasonable to assume that ropes are the means of holding on.step 2: in the hypothesis, it is stated that there would be 'no more rope to hold on to in a few minutes'. this directly relates to the premise as it also concerns the ability to hold on to the train. since the premise implies that holding on is becoming increasingly difficult, the hypothesis is a logical continuation of the situation described.step 3: based on the information identified in step 1 and the logical connection between the premise and hypothesis, the hypothesis can be reasonably inferred from the premise."
4494,"There's lots for children to do, and there are some wonderful spaces for secluded picnics.",This is not a place for children.,0,0,True,"step 1: in the premise, it is stated that there are 'lots for children to do' and 'wonderful spaces for secluded picnics'. this implies that the location is child-friendly and offers activities and spaces suitable for children. step 2: the hypothesis contradicts the premise by stating 'this is not a place for children'. however, the premise does not provide any reason or information that would logically lead to this conclusion. step 3: based on the information given, there is no entailment from the premise to the hypothesis. the hypothesis is not a logical consequence of the premise."
4495,And I met Christina Paqualerra during the tournament there.,I did not meet Christina Paqualerra at a tournament.,0,0,True,"step 1: in the premise, the speaker met christina paqualerra 'during the tournament there', which implies that the meeting took place at a tournament. this information is factual and logically consistent. step 2: the hypothesis states that the speaker 'did not meet christina paqualerra at a tournament', which contradicts the premise. step 3: based on the given information, the hypothesis is not entailed by the premise as it directly contradicts the stated fact."
4496,and uh yeah he was a he's uh we call him Dana Jerk,"His nickname is Dana Jerk, I named him that",1,1,True,"step 1: in the premise, 'dana jerk' is identified as a person and his nickname is mentioned. the hypothesis also states that 'his nickname is dana jerk'. the information in both the premise and hypothesis is identical.step 2: given that the premise and hypothesis convey the same fact about 'dana jerk's nickname, the hypothesis can be logically inferred from the premise.step 3: in summary, the hypothesis is a restatement of the information provided in the premise, and it follows logically from the premise.label: 1"
4497,"Before 6 June 1944 the peaceful stretch of coast west of Cabourg, from Ouistreham to the Cotentin peninsula, was known simply as the Cete du Calvados, a flat, undramatic shoreline broken by a few unspectacular chalk cliffs and sand dunes.","The Cete du Calvados was always a lonely area, since almost no one lived there.",1,1,True,"step 1: the premise describes the cete du calvados as a peaceful, undramatic shoreline with few inhabitants before 6 june 1944. the absence of people is mentioned as a characteristic of the area. step 2: the hypothesis states that the cete du calvados was always a lonely area since almost no one lived there. this hypothesis can be logically inferred from the premise, as the premise already establishes the condition that 'almost no one lived' there before a specific date. step 3: based on the information provided in the premise, the hypothesis is a logical consequence, as it only expands on the characteristics of the cete du calvados mentioned in the premise."
4498,It's also why your dentist may bully you into gum surgery.,It's the reason why dentists advise against gum surgery.,0,0,True,"step 1: the premise suggests that dentists may pressure patients into gum surgery for reasons not directly related to dental health. this could be due to financial gain or other motivations. step 2: the hypothesis states that dentists advise against gum surgery for a reason. while the reason is not explicitly stated, it is not necessarily contrary to the premise. it is possible that the reason is based on valid dental health concerns. step 3: the hypothesis cannot be logically inferred from the premise because the premise does not provide enough information to determine if the reasons dentists have for advising against gum surgery align with the reasons given in the premise. the hypothesis may still be true, but it is not a logical consequence of the premise."
4499,you cook them so often you kind of forget their names yeah yeah,I often forget the names of fruit.,1,1,True,"step 1: the premise refers to the speaker often forgetting the names of foods. no specific type of food is mentioned, leaving it open to various possibilities including fruits. this forgetfulness is a common experience and does not contradict the hypothesis.step 2: the hypothesis states that the speaker often forgets the names of fruit. this is a special case of the more general statement in the premise, as fruit is a type of food. the hypothesis can be logically inferred from the premise as the forgetfulness described in the premise can apply to any type of food, including fruit.step 3: based on the logical reasoning and the given information, the hypothesis can be inferred from the premise."
6001,i don't remember what it is now four hundred dollars for the month let's say and uh i mean some months i may spend three hundred on groceries and a hundred on everything else and,"For the last few months that I remember, I spend about seven hundred on groceries.",0,0,True,"step 1. the premise describes the speaker's monthly expenses, mentioning an approximate figure of $400 for an unspecified expense and giving examples of varying spending on groceries and other expenses. no explicit mention is made of groceries being the only expense totaling $700, as stated in the hypothesis.step 2. the hypothesis asserts that the speaker has been spending $700 on groceries for the last few months, which is more than the $300-$400 range mentioned in the premise. the hypothesis contradicts the information in the premise.step 3. based on the given premise, the hypothesis cannot be logically inferred as it contradicts the information provided."
6002,"'I need to use your mouth for the next part,' she interrupted.",She needed to use my mouth for a taste test.,1,0,False,"step 1: the premise indicates that she interrupted someone and stated the need to use 'your mouth' for 'the next part'. the term 'next part' could refer to various situations, but the phrase 'use your mouth' is ambiguous and could mean different things, such as speaking or eating. however, the context provided does not supply enough information to determine the exact meaning.step 2: the hypothesis 'she needed to use my mouth for a taste test' adds new information not present in the premise. while it's possible for someone to use another person's mouth for a taste test, there is no indication in the premise that this was the intended use of the mouth.step 3: based on the given information, the hypothesis cannot be logically inferred from the premise as it introduces new context that goes beyond the scope of the premise."
6003,"Northern conquests, including Hungary, had been lost by the close of the 17th century.",Northern conquests did not include Hungary.,0,0,True,"step 1: in the premise, it is stated that northern conquests had been lost by the close of the 17th century, and hungary is identified as one of those lost conquests. step 2: the hypothesis suggests that northern conquests did not include hungary. however, given the information in the premise, we know that hungary was indeed a part of the northern conquests that were lost. therefore, the hypothesis contradicts the premise. step 3: based on the logical reasoning and factual inconsistency between the premise and hypothesis, the hypothesis is not entailed by the premise."
6004,"The museum is partly housed in the elegant 15th-century mansion that belonged to Nicolas Rolin, a wealthy dignitary and the benefactor of the famous H??tel-Dieu (hospital) at Beaune .",Nicolas Rolin spent most of his life living in the mansion. ,1,1,True,"step 1: the premise states that the museum is partly housed in a 15th-century mansion that belonged to nicolas rolin. it also mentions that rolin was a wealthy dignitary and the benefactor of the hôtel-dieu hospital at beaune. the implication is that rolin likely owned and resided in the mansion. step 2: the hypothesis suggests that nicolas rolin spent most of his life living in the mansion. this hypothesis is consistent with the information in the premise, as the premise implies that rolin lived in the mansion at some point in his life. step 3: given the information provided in the premise, the hypothesis can be inferred as a reasonable assumption, as it is not contradictory and fits within the context of the information provided.therefore, based on the logical reasoning and common sense, the hypothesis can be inferred from the premise."
6005,"The presence language appeared in the LSC appropriations act as part of an effort to expand LSC representation to aliens other than lawful residents, and does not appear to have been intended to limit LSC representation to aliens who were continuously physically present in the United States.",LSC itended to limit representation of aliens in the United States.,0,0,True,"step 1: in the premise, the presence of language regarding the language access services (las) in the lsc appropriations act is described. the context suggests that the las expansion was aimed at representing aliens other than lawful residents. however, there is no clear indication that the las was meant to limit representation to only certain categories of aliens. step 2: the hypothesis suggests that lsc intended to limit representation of aliens in the united states. however, based on the information provided in the premise, there is no logical connection or clear evidence to support this hypothesis. in fact, the premise suggests the opposite, that the las expansion was not intended to be limiting in this way. step 3: given the lack of logical connection or clear evidence, and the fact that the premise suggests the opposite of the hypothesis, it cannot be reasonably inferred that the lsc intended to limit representation of aliens in the united states based on the given premise."
6006,"In the Lodore area, it's worth taking a detour to see Lodore Falls, situated behind the Lodore Hotel.",You can't visit Lodore without heading over to the Lodore Falls.,1,1,True,"step 1: in the premise, it is mentioned that lodore falls are situated behind the lodore hotel in the lodore area. this implies that lodore falls are a notable attraction in the vicinity. step 2: the hypothesis suggests that visiting lodore without seeing the lodore falls is not possible. given the information from the premise, it is reasonable to infer that lodore falls are a significant part of the lodore experience that any visitor would want to see. step 3: based on the logical reasoning and the lack of contradictory information, the hypothesis can be inferred from the premise."
6007,The managed care debate presents this issue in a slightly different context.,More people are siding with managed care in the debate.,1,0,False,"step 1: in the premise, it is mentioned that the managed care debate presents an issue in a different context. this does not provide sufficient information to determine if more people are siding with managed care or not. it only indicates that the debate is being discussed in a new context.step 2: the hypothesis that 'more people are siding with managed care in the debate' is not logically inferred from the premise. the premise does not provide any indication, fact, or context that would lead to this conclusion.step 3: based on the information provided, the hypothesis is not entailed by the premise."
6008,I do not know whether this theory is true.,I think the theory is true. ,1,0,False,"step 1: in the premise, the speaker states that they do not know whether a theory is true or not. this implies a lack of certainty or knowledge about the theory's veracity. in the hypothesis, the speaker expresses their belief or opinion that the theory is true.step 2: the hypothesis contradicts the premise, as the speaker in the hypothesis claims to know or believe the theory is true, while in the premise, they admit they don't know.step 3: based on the logical analysis, the hypothesis cannot be inferred from the premise, as they directly contradict each other."
6009,"The F/A-18E/F had 56 percent of its drawings completed and also had over 90 percent of its higher level interface drawings completed, adding confidence in the system design.",Drawings are not needed to design anything.,0,0,True,"step 1: in the premise, it is mentioned that the f/a-18e/f had 56 percent of its drawings completed and over 90 percent of its higher level interface drawings completed. this implies that the drawings are an essential part of the system design process, as the completion of a significant percentage of them indicates progress and confidence in the design.step 2: the hypothesis, however, states that 'drawings are not needed to design anything'. this directly contradicts the premise, as the premise clearly indicates that drawings are necessary for the design of the f/a-18e/f.step 3: based on the logical inconsistency between the premise and hypothesis, the hypothesis cannot be logically inferred from the premise."
6010,The preamble to the proposed rule stated that the entities that would be required to comply with the rule are public utilities and transmitting utilities that do not fall within the Regulatory Flexibility Act's definition of small entity.,There was no rule that was being proposed.,0,0,True,"step 1: in the premise, it is stated that a proposed rule exists and identifies the entities that would be subject to the rule. the absence of a rule being proposed in the hypothesis directly contradicts the information in the premise. step 2: the hypothesis cannot be logically inferred from the premise as they are contradictory. step 3: based on the logical negation of the information in the premise, the hypothesis is not entailed by the premise."
6011,"No, I don't.","Yes, I do.",0,0,True,"step 1: in the premise, the speaker denies having something. in the hypothesis, the speaker is stated to have that very thing. the negation in the premise directly contradicts the affirmation in the hypothesis. step 2: the hypothesis cannot be logically inferred from the premise as the hypothesis is a contradiction of the premise. step 3: based on the logical negation relationship between the premise and hypothesis, the hypothesis is not entailed by the premise."
6012,"If this occurred, the Service's configuration would be that of a successful competitor and, at the same time, any benefits from having one provider would be retained.","If the merger occurs, the service's setup will be similar to the company buying them out, but they would be able to retain their benefits from having their service.",1,1,True,"step 1: in the premise, it is stated that if a certain occurrence (occurrence of this) takes place, then the service's configuration would be that of a successful competitor, and the benefits from having one provider would still be retained. this implies that the service's setup, similar to a successful competitor's, would be maintained while the benefits of having a single provider would not be lost.step 2: in the hypothesis, it is stated that if the merger occurs, the service's setup will be similar to the company buying them out, but they would be able to retain their benefits from having their service. this hypothesis is consistent with the premise as it suggests that the service would maintain their setup as a successful competitor while keeping their benefits, which aligns with the 'if...and' condition stated in the premise.step 3: based on the logical similarity between the premise and hypothesis, the hypothesis can be inferred from the premise as a valid implication."
6013,"She was a most generous woman, and possessed a considerable fortune of her own. ",She was wicked and dirt poor.,0,0,True,"step 1: in the premise, the woman is described as generous and wealthy. generosity is a positive trait, while wealth indicates financial security. no information is provided in the premise that could support the hypothesis of wickedness or poverty.step 2: the hypothesis contradicts the premise because it asserts that the woman is wicked and poor, while the premise states that she is generous and wealthy. the hypothesis cannot be logically inferred from the premise.step 3: based on the logical analysis, the hypothesis is not entailed by the premise."
6014,"Postal density is the number of delivery points that can be visited by the carrier in one hour of time, excluding loading time and the variable portion of access time and the variable portion of travel time to and from the route.",Postal density is how many delivery points a carrier can visit in one hour on an urban route.,1,1,True,"step 1: in the premise, postal density is defined as the number of delivery points that can be visited by a carrier in one hour, excluding certain time factors. this definition implies that the number of delivery points a carrier can visit in an hour is the focus of the term 'postal density'. urban routes are not explicitly mentioned in the premise but are a common context for higher postal densities due to closer delivery points.step 2: the hypothesis essentially paraphrases the definition of postal density, but it specifically mentions 'an urban route'. given that urban routes are a common context for higher postal densities, it is reasonable to infer that the hypothesis is entailed by the premise. the hypothesis does not contradict the premise and only adds a specific context that is generally true.step 3: based on the logical equivalence between the premise and hypothesis and the common understanding of postal density, the hypothesis is a valid inference from the premise."
6017,"Good-bye, old thing. The two young people went off in opposite directions.",The two young people chose to leave together.,0,0,True,"step 1: the premise describes the scene where two young people said 'good-bye' to an old thing and went off in opposite directions. this indicates that they parted ways. step 2: the hypothesis suggests that they chose to leave together. however, the premise contradicts this, as it explicitly states that they went off in opposite directions. step 3: based on the logical analysis, the hypothesis is not entailed by the premise."
6018,well i guess they do i don't know why they wouldn't oh you haven't really i just thought it was my set so i just didn't have a a good quality set you know,I plan to get a better quality set in a month or so.,1,0,False,"step 1: the premise expresses uncertainty and an intention to improve the quality of a set, without specifying the nature of the set or the reason for the intention. it does not provide enough information to directly infer the hypothesis. however, the premise does not contradict the hypothesis.step 2: the hypothesis indicates an intention to obtain a better quality set in the future. this is not logically inferred from the premise, but it is not contradictory as the premise does not state that the speaker currently has a good quality set.step 3: based on the lack of contradiction and the absence of sufficient information in the premise to logically infer the hypothesis, it cannot be determined if the hypothesis is entailed by the premise."
6019,"If both know nothing about Monica, then both are happy.",They will be happy regardless of knowing Monica or not.,0,1,False,"step 1: in the premise, it is stated that both individuals are happy when they know nothing about monica. this implies that the absence of knowledge about monica is a condition for their happiness. step 2: the hypothesis states that they will be happy regardless of knowing monica or not. this is similar to the condition stated in the premise, as 'regardless of knowing monica' can be considered an extension of 'knowing nothing about monica'. step 3: based on the logical equivalence between the conditions in the premise and hypothesis, the hypothesis can be inferred from the premise."
6020,and then last year that's when they really had that cold spell,"Temperatures were higher than usual last year, with no cold spells observed.",0,0,True,"step 1. in the premise, it is mentioned that 'last year they really had that cold spell'. this implies that the temperatures were significantly lower than usual during that period. step 2. in contrast, the hypothesis states that 'temperatures were higher than usual last year, with no cold spells observed'. this is directly contradictory to the information provided in the premise. step 3. given the clear contradiction between the premise and hypothesis, it cannot be reasonably inferred that the hypothesis is entailed by the premise.step 4. it's important to note that the absence of evidence is not evidence of absence. the premise only mentions the existence of a cold spell, it does not rule out the possibility of higher temperatures during other periods in the year. however, the hypothesis makes a definitive statement about the temperatures being higher than usual throughout the entire year, which is in contradiction to the information provided in the premise.based on the information identified in the premise, the logical connection, and the contradictory nature of the hypothesis, the hypothesis is not entailed by the premise."
6023,(Just remember to use sunscreen sunburn and possible dehydration are never too far away. ),The profits of soda companies are bigger in the summertime.,1,0,False,"step 1. in the premise, there is a mention of sunburn and dehydration, which are common health issues during summer. this information does not directly relate to soda companies or their profits. however, it sets the context of the discussion to the summer season.step 2. the hypothesis states that the profits of soda companies are bigger in the summertime. this could be logically inferred from the premise if we consider the following: a. consumption of soda or beverages in general tends to increase during warmer months due to people trying to stay hydrated. b. increased consumption often leads to higher sales and profits for businesses. c. there are no contradictory facts or information in the premise that would negate the hypothesis.step 3. based on the given context of the summer season and the logical reasoning, the hypothesis can be inferred from the premise. the premise does not explicitly state that soda profits are bigger in the summer but the given information in the premise provides enough context for the hypothesis to be a reasonable assumption.however, it is important to note that the premise does not directly entail the hypothesis, but rather sets the context for the hypothesis to make logical sense."
6024,Lumme! came ecstatically from Albert.,Lumme was Albert's long lost lover who had just been found.,1,0,False,"step 1: the premise 'lumme! came ecstatically from albert' does not provide sufficient information to logically infer that lumme was albert's long lost lover. the term 'lumme' is not defined in the premise, and there's no mention of 'long lost lover' or 'found' in the context of the premise.step 2: the hypothesis makes an assumption about the relationship between albert and lumme (as long lost lovers) that is not stated or implied in the premise. the hypothesis contradicts the available information, as it adds an unproven and unrelated assumption to the premise.step 3: based on the given information, the hypothesis cannot be logically inferred from the premise.step 4: the hypothesis goes beyond the scope of the premise and adds unproven assumptions, making it an invalid inference."
6025,"Danny Boy Steward (born October 31, 1977) is a Chicago native known by his stage name Danny Boy or DB.","Danny Boy Steward (born October 31, 1977) is a Chicago native known by his stage name Danny Boy or Takeda.",1,0,False,"step 1: the premise establishes that danny boy steward was born on october 31, 1977, in chicago, and is known by the stage names danny boy or db. no additional information is provided that would suggest a different name, takeda, being relevant. step 2: the hypothesis proposes an alternative stage name, takeda, for danny boy steward. however, no logical connection or justification is given in the hypothesis for the need or reasonableness of this alternative name. step 3: since the hypothesis does not logically follow from the premise and there is no factual or common-sense evidence to support the introduction of 'takeda' as a stage name for danny boy steward, the hypothesis cannot be inferred from the premise.step 4: it's important to note that having the same birth date and being a chicago native are not sufficient conditions to logically infer that 'danny boy steward' and 'takeda' refer to the same person. in order for the hypothesis to be entailed by the premise, a logical connection between the two names would need to be established."
6026,Auditors also need to consider whether any reliance will be placed on internal controls in designing audit procedures.,There is no need for auditors to consider whether any reliance will be placed on internal controls in designing audit procedures.,0,0,True,"step 1: in the premise, it is stated that auditors need to consider whether any reliance will be placed on internal controls in designing audit procedures. this implies that internal controls are relevant and can impact the auditing process. step 2: the hypothesis suggests that there is no need for auditors to consider internal controls during the auditing procedure design. this directly contradicts the premise as it asserts the opposite, that is, internal controls are not relevant for auditors to consider. step 3: based on the logical contradiction between the premise and hypothesis, the hypothesis is not entailed by the premise."
6027,Expenses of administration include an appropriate allocation of agency overhead costs.,Expenses of administration include a free burger from McDonald's.,1,0,False,"step 1: in the premise, 'expenses of administration' refers to costs related to managing and operating an organization or agency. 'appropriate allocation of agency overhead costs' implies expenses that are necessary and justified for the operation of the agency.step 2: the hypothesis suggests an expense that is unrelated to the normal administrative costs, as a 'free burger from mcdonald's' is a consumption expense and not an overhead cost. the hypothesis contradicts the semantics of the term 'administrative expenses' as defined in the premise.step 3: based on the logical analysis, it is clear that the hypothesis cannot be inferred from the premise as it presents a fundamentally different type of expense."
6028,Vrenna parried another sword strike and planted her remaining short sword under the chin of her opponent until his cap came off and balanced on the tip.,Vrenna drew blood with the sword.,1,1,True,"step 1: the premise describes an action where vrenna parries an opponent's sword strike and impales the opponent under the chin with her short sword. this results in the opponent's cap coming off and balancing on the tip of the sword. the action of impaling an opponent typically implies successful contact and penetration of their body. common sense and logical consistency suggest that such contact would likely result in drawing blood. step 2: the hypothesis 'vrenna drew blood with the sword' can be logically inferred from the premise as the described action of impaling the opponent under the chin with the sword is a necessary condition for drawing blood. step 3: based on the logical reasoning and common sense, the hypothesis is entailed by the premise."
6029,"The Royal Navy captured her at to the surrender of Valletta, on 4 September 1800, and took her into service as "" Athenienne "".","The Royal Navy captured her at or prior to the surrender of Valletta, on 4 September 1800, and took her into service as ""Athenienne"".",1,1,True,"step 1: in the premise, it is stated that the royal navy captured the ship 'her' at the surrender of valletta on 4 september 1800 and took it into service as 'athenienne'. this information provides the context of when and how the ship was captured and renamed by the royal navy. step 2: the hypothesis is identical to the premise, with the exception that it uses the inclusive 'or prior to' instead of 'at the' in the first part. this difference is minor and does not change the essential meaning of the hypothesis. the hypothesis is logically equivalent to the premise. step 3: given that the hypothesis is logically equivalent to the premise, it can be inferred from the premise."
6030,"I had me some weeks in a prison stockade, which ain't, I'm tellin' you, no way for to spend any livin' time.",I've never been in a prison. ,0,0,True,"step 1: in the premise, the speaker is describing a personal experience of spending 'some weeks' in a 'prison stockade'. this implies that the speaker was indeed incarcerated. the speaker's tone also suggests that they did not enjoy this experience.step 2: the hypothesis that 'i've never been in a prison' directly contradicts the premise. the speaker's statement that they spent time in a prison stockade is incompatible with never having been in a prison.step 3: based on the contradiction between the premise and hypothesis, the hypothesis is not logically entailed by the premise. in fact, the hypothesis is the negation of the premise. therefore, the hypothesis cannot be inferred from the premise."
6031,"The club sailed in, head over tail.",The club was stationary.,0,0,True,"step 1: the premise describes the club sailing in with its head over tail, which is an unusual way for a boat to move. however, it does not provide any information about the boat being stationary or not. step 2: the hypothesis, 'the club was stationary', contradicts the premise, 'the club sailed in, head over tail'. a boat cannot be both sailing (moving) and stationary at the same time. step 3: based on the logical contradiction between the premise and hypothesis, the hypothesis is not entailed by the premise."
6032,"We'll both ride, Mr. Drew.",We could both use a ride with Mr. Drew to the next town.,1,1,True,"step 1: in the premise, 'we'll both ride' implies that both individuals involved in the conversation will be traveling with mr. drew. this can be understood as a commitment or plan to ride with him. step 2: the hypothesis suggests that 'we could both use a ride with mr. drew' which is an alternative way of expressing the need or desire for a ride with mr. drew. this is a logical implication of the premise since 'riding with mr. drew' is a common action for both individuals. step 3: based on the logical connection between the premise and hypothesis, and the lack of contradictory information, the hypothesis is a logical entailment of the premise."
6033,The Trajaneum was erected during the second century a.d. in honour of the deified emperors Trajan and Hadrian.,The Trajaneum was built in honor of Zeus.,0,0,True,"step 1. in the premise, we have the information that the trajaneum was built during the second century a.d. in honor of the deified emperors trajan and hadrian. this tells us that the trajaneum is a building with historical significance, and its purpose was to honor those two emperors. step 2. the hypothesis, 'the trajaneum was built in honor of zeus', contradicts the information provided in the premise. while the trajaneum was indeed a building dedicated to honoring individuals, the hypothesis suggests those individuals are different – deities, specifically zeus. step 3. based on the provided information, there is no logical connection or justification for the hypothesis. the hypothesis is not entailed by the premise."
6034,"Of course, it was all a bad dream. ",I was a happy dream.,0,0,True,"step 1: a 'bad dream' is a subjective experience of a dream being unpleasant or frightening. it does not provide any specific information about the content of the dream or the dreamer. 'i was a happy dream' is a statement about the dreamer's emotional state during the dream. however, since a 'bad dream' implies an unpleasant experience, it is not logically consistent with the hypothesis of 'i was a happy dream'. step 2: 'i was a happy dream' cannot be logically inferred from the premise 'of course, it was all a bad dream'. step 3: the hypothesis contradicts the premise and, therefore, it cannot be entailed by the premise."
6036,"His first act was to ride to Haghia Sophia and order that it be converted into a mosque; on the following Friday, he attended the first Muslim prayers in what came to be called Ayasofya Camii (Mosque of Haghia Sophia).",He  was the one who named the mosque Ayasofya Camil.,1,1,True,"step 1: in the premise, it is mentioned that the speaker 'ordered that it be converted into a mosque' and 'attended the first muslim prayers' at haghia sophia. this implies that the speaker is the one who initiated the conversion of haghia sophia into a mosque and was present for its inauguration. step 2: the hypothesis suggests that the speaker 'was the one who named the mosque ayasofya camii'. the actions in the premise do not directly mention the speaker naming the mosque. however, historical records indicate that the name ayasofya camii was given to the mosque during the early ottoman period when the conversion took place. it is reasonable to infer that the speaker, being the one who initiated the conversion and being the leader of the ottoman empire at the time, likely had the authority to name the mosque. step 3: based on the logical connection between the premise and hypothesis, and the historical context, it can be inferred that the speaker, indeed, named the mosque ayasofya camii."
6037,They also promised to try to solve their border dispute over Kashmir.,The military officers promised that they would work to resolve the dispute. ,1,1,True,"step 1: the premise indicates that 'they' (implicitly referring to both parties involved in the dispute) made a promise to 'try to solve' their border dispute over kashmir. this implies an intention to find a resolution. step 2: the hypothesis states that 'the military officers' specifically promised to work on resolving the dispute. while the premise does not explicitly mention the military officers, it is reasonable to infer that they are included in the broader 'they.' both the premise and hypothesis suggest that a promise was made to work towards resolving the dispute. step 3: based on the logical implication and the similarity in meaning between the two statements, the hypothesis can be inferred from the premise."
6038,"In the narrow streets lined with merchants' and tailors' shops, the Star of David, menorahs, and Jewish names are actually more plentiful than Jewish people themselves.",The merchants here are Jewish. ,0,1,False,"step 1: the premise describes a scene where jewish symbols and names are more common than jewish people themselves. this implies that the area has a significant jewish presence, even if the number of jewish people does not match the number of jewish symbols. step 2: the hypothesis suggests that the merchants in the area are jewish. given the context and the prevalence of jewish symbols and names, it is a reasonable assumption that the merchants are jewish as well. this is because it is a common observation that jewish communities often have a high concentration of jewish-owned businesses. step 3: based on the logical connection between the premise and hypothesis, and the common-sense understanding of jewish communities, the hypothesis can be inferred from the premise."
6040,"The audits conducted by the General Accounting Office (GAO) and reported in June 1999, confirmed the Inspector General's findings as to the factors causing systemic errors in grantee case reporting.",There was corruption in the grantee case reporting that was found.,1,0,False,"step 1: the premise states that the gao audits in june 1999 confirmed the presence of systemic errors in grantee case reporting. systemic errors imply that errors occurred frequently and consistently throughout the reporting process. commonsense understanding suggests that systemic errors could be caused by a variety of reasons, including mismanagement, inadequate training, or corruption. step 2: the hypothesis, 'there was corruption in the grantee case reporting that was found,' cannot be definitively determined from the premise. while corruption is a possible cause of systemic errors, the premise does not provide any direct evidence that corruption was present. step 3: based on the information provided in the premise, the hypothesis cannot be logically inferred as it goes beyond the stated facts.therefore, the hypothesis is not entailed by the premise."
6041,But whenever Drew thought seriously of the future he had that odd sense of dislocation and loss which he had first known on the night he had seen Don Cazar arrive at the cantina.,He had been hiding behind an overturned table when he had seen Don Cazar in the cantina.,1,0,False,"step 1: the premise describes drew's emotional response to thinking about the future and mentions the instance of seeing don cazar at the cantina. there is no explicit information about drew's location or actions during that event. step 2: the hypothesis suggests a specific action (hiding behind an overturned table) that could potentially explain why drew might have felt a sense of dislocation and loss when he saw don cazar. however, the hypothesis goes beyond the information provided in the premise. step 3: based on the given information, the hypothesis cannot be logically inferred from the premise as it introduces new details not mentioned in the premise."
6042,"The Shore formed around the mouth of the Waters of Leith, the narrow river running through Edinburgh.",Edinburgh was formed around the river that flows through it.,1,1,True,"step 1: in the premise, 'the shore formed around the mouth of the waters of leith, the narrow river running through edinburgh' describes how the geographical feature 'the shore' came to be located near the 'mouth' or entry point of the 'waters of leith', a river that passes through 'edinburgh'. this information implies that edinburgh is situated next to the waters of leith. step 2: the hypothesis 'edinburgh was formed around the river that flows through it' states that edinburgh came into existence around or due to the presence of the river. this is a reasonable inference from the premise, as the premise indicates that the shore formed around the river, implying a close relationship between edinburgh and the waters of leith. step 3: based on the logical connection between the premise and hypothesis, and the lack of contradictory information, the hypothesis 'edinburgh was formed around the river that flows through it' can be logically inferred from the premise."
6043,"Now, as we gain weight and push our setpoints upward, we are reprogrammed to eat even more.",Gaining weight and pushing setpoints upward can reprogram us to eat even less.,0,0,True,"step 1: in the premise, the process of gaining weight and pushing setpoints upward leads to an increased hunger and need to eat more. this is a common observation in weight gain and obesity. step 2: the hypothesis suggests an opposite effect - that gaining weight and pushing setpoints upward can reprogram us to eat even less. this is not a logical or common-sense conclusion based on the given information. in fact, the evidence generally supports the premise rather than the hypothesis. step 3: based on the logical reasoning, common sense, and factual consistency, the hypothesis is not entailed by the premise."
6044," ""So your girl writes that your little farewell activity didn't fare so well, eh?"" he chortled.",Your little girl wrote about how well your farewell activity went.,0,0,True,"step 1: the premise indicates that the speaker was discussing a situation where someone (presumably the speaker himself) had organized a farewell activity, and this person's girlfriend had written about it. the speaker mentions that the writing was not positive, suggesting that the girlfriend had criticized the activity in her communication. step 2: the hypothesis states that the girl wrote about the farewell activity, but it does not specify whether the writing was positive or negative. this information does not contradict the premise, as the premise only mentions that the writing was not positive. step 3: although the hypothesis does not logically follow from the premise, as it does not fully capture the relationship between the premise and hypothesis, it is not in direct contradiction with it. the hypothesis could still be a possible explanation for the situation described in the premise, as the speaker may be misinterpreting or misunderstanding the content of his girlfriend's writing. therefore, while the hypothesis cannot be strictly logically inferred, it does not contradict the premise, and there is a plausible connection between the two statements."
6045,Core competencies and supporting  The agencies identified core competencies and supporting behaviors for senior executives to follow that are intended to contribute to their agencies' achievement of performance goals.,Senior executives don't have to have any core competencies because they don't contribute to performance goals.,0,0,True,"step 1: in the premise, it is stated that core competencies and supporting behaviors for senior executives have been identified and are intended to contribute to their agencies' achievement of performance goals. this implies that having core competencies is a desirable trait for senior executives and that these competencies play a role in the successful functioning of the agencies.step 2: the hypothesis suggests that senior executives do not need to have any core competencies. this directly contradicts the premise, as it implies that core competencies are not necessary for senior executives to contribute to their agencies' performance goals.step 3: based on the logical reasoning, it can be concluded that the hypothesis is not entailed by the premise, as the hypothesis contradicts the premise and cannot be logically inferred from it."
6046,library collection.,library compilation,1,1,True,"step 1. a library collection refers to the accumulation of books, documents, or other informational materials in a library. it is a set of resources available for borrowing or research. the term 'collection' implies the gathering and organization of items. 'compilation' refers to the process of bringing materials together to form a unified whole.step 2. the hypothesis 'library compilation' can be inferred from the premise 'library collection'. the collection of library items goes through the process of compilation to create a unified body of knowledge or resources. the compilation is an essential part of the library collection process.step 3. based on the logical connection between the premise and hypothesis, the hypothesis 'library compilation' can be inferred from the premise 'library collection'."
6047,It is not uncommon for extensive testimony to focus on discount differences of one or two tenths of a cent per piece.,It's highly unusual for a small discount different like one tenth of a cent per piece to be discussed extensively in testimony.,0,0,True,"step 1: in the premise, 'extensive testimony' refers to detailed and lengthy discussions. 'discount differences of one or two tenths of a cent per piece' implies minor variations in price. step 2: the hypothesis suggests that discussing such minor price differences extensively is 'highly unusual.' however, the premise indicates that it is 'not uncommon' for such discussions to occur. therefore, according to the information provided, the hypothesis contradicts the premise as it suggests a rarity where the premise states a common occurrence. step 3: based on the logical analysis, the hypothesis cannot be inferred from the premise as they are contradictory."
6048,Its odor was not unpleasant but it carried clods of soil at its ends.,It reeked like a dead body.,0,0,True,"step 1: in the premise, the odor is described as not unpleasant but carrying clods of soil. this implies a strong, earthy smell, which is different from the putrid, decaying smell associated with a dead body. step 2: the hypothesis 'it reeked like a dead body' contradicts the premise, as a dead body's odor is significantly different and stronger than the described odor. step 3: based on the provided information, the hypothesis cannot be logically inferred from the premise, as they describe different odors."
6049,"You would inherit it, wouldn't you?""","You would be the rightful owner of the estate, would you?",1,1,True,"step 1: in the premise, the speaker implies that the listener would inherit something. this implies that the speaker believes the listener has a claim or right to the estate. step 2: the hypothesis also relates to ownership of the estate, suggesting that the speaker or someone else might consider the listener the rightful owner. this is consistent with the information in the premise. step 3: given that both sentences discuss the listener's potential ownership of the estate, the hypothesis is an entailment of the premise.step 4: in more detail, the premise establishes that the speaker believes the listener would inherit the estate. the hypothesis goes further by stating that the listener would be the 'rightful owner,' but this is a reasonable inference from the premise. the speaker's use of the word 'inherit' implies a legal or rightful claim to the estate, which is what the hypothesis asserts.therefore, the hypothesis can be logically inferred from the premise."
6050,"Bean and Lands' End kept everything in stock until Christmas Day, they'd go broke warehousing the unsold surplus or marking it down.","Bean and Land's End were out of stock by Christmas Day, which saved them having to mark it down.",0,1,False,"step 1. in the premise, bean and lands' end are described as keeping everything in stock until christmas day and facing the possibility of going broke due to the unsold surplus or marking it down. this implies a large inventory of unsold items. step 2. the hypothesis states that bean and lands' end were out of stock by christmas day. this is a contradictory condition to the premise's statement of having an excessive inventory. step 3. however, it is essential to consider that the hypothesis does not directly contradict the premise if we assume that the reason they were out of stock was due to selling all their inventory before christmas day, rather than being unable to sell it. in such a case, they would not have had to mark down the unsold stock, thus avoiding the issue of going broke. so, the hypothesis can be inferred from the premise if we consider this alternate interpretation. step 4. this alternate interpretation relies on a common business practice of selling all available inventory before marking down prices for the holiday season. it is a reasonable assumption, and there is no factual contradiction to this interpretation based on the information provided in the premise. step 5. therefore, while the hypothesis is not explicitly stated in the premise, it can be logically inferred with a reasonable interpretation and assumption based on common business practices and the information given in the premise."
6051,"The Evaluation of Broad Aim  Experimental Design, Its Difficulties and an Alternative.",There are no difficulties included with broad aim design.,0,0,True,"step 1: in the premise, 'the evaluation of broad aim experimental design, its difficulties and an alternative' refers to a title of a publication or research topic. 'broad aim design' likely refers to a research design or approach with a wide scope or goal. the inclusion of the term 'difficulties' implies that there are challenges or complications associated with this design.step 2: the hypothesis 'there are no difficulties included with broad aim design' directly contradicts the information provided in the premise. the premise acknowledges the existence of difficulties, while the hypothesis asserts the absence of difficulties.step 3: based on the logical reasoning and the given information, the hypothesis cannot be inferred from the premise as it contradicts it."
6052,"And during a short career as a Cornhusker football player, he shooed a young Tom Osborne off a practice field.",He never shooed Tom Osborne off the practice field.,0,0,True,"step 1: the premise describes an action where 'he' (an unspecified individual) shooed tom osborne off a practice field during his time as a cornhusker football player. this is a clear statement of an event. step 2: the hypothesis states the opposite of the premise. if the premise is true, then the hypothesis is false. step 3: based on the information provided and the logical negation of the premise, the hypothesis cannot be inferred from the premise."
6053,"Alcohol problems designate a spectrum from risk behavior to illness, and from problematic consumption to alcohol use disorder.",Drinking to much alcohol can make you sick.,1,1,True,"step 1: in the premise, alcohol problems are described as ranging from risk behavior to illness, and from problematic consumption to alcohol use disorder. this implies that there is a continuum of alcohol use, with some levels leading to negative health consequences. 'drinking too much alcohol' is an example of problematic consumption. step 2: the hypothesis, 'drinking too much alcohol can make you sick,' can be inferred from the premise because it describes a specific instance of problematic consumption leading to negative health consequences. this is a logical entailment as the premise establishes the relationship between problematic consumption and health issues. step 3: based on the logical reasoning derived from the information provided in the premise, the hypothesis is a logical entailment."
6054,"When they began playing, they never thought soccer careers would amount to anything like the month-long World Cup extravaganza or women's soccer's debut at the '96 Atlanta Summer Olympics before that.",After playing soccer for years big events happened.,1,1,True,"step 1: in the premise, it is stated that when they began playing soccer, they didn't expect their careers to lead to major events like the world cup or women's soccer at the atlanta olympics. this implies that their soccer careers progressed over a significant period of time. the hypothesis 'after playing soccer for years, big events happened' is consistent with this information. step 2: the hypothesis 'after playing soccer for years, big events happened' can be logically inferred from the premise because the premise establishes that their soccer careers lasted for a considerable time and that major events did indeed occur during that time. step 3: based on the logical connection between the premise and hypothesis, and the lack of contradictory information, the hypothesis can be inferred from the premise."
6055,"The 29th, you say, is the date.",You say that is happened on the 29th?,1,1,True,"step 1. both the premise and hypothesis contain the same phrase, 'you say that is happened on the 29th' and 'the 29th, you say, is the date'. this suggests that the speaker is referring to a specific date and that they have communicated this date to someone (possibly the listener). this information is consistent with both the premise and hypothesis.step 2. the hypothesis is a question, but it is a question that appears to be asking for confirmation of the information already provided in the premise. in other words, the hypothesis seems to be asking, 'is it true that the event happened on the 29th?'. given that the premise also mentions the 29th, it seems reasonable to infer that the answer to this question is 'yes'.step 3. based on the logical connection between the premise and hypothesis, the hypothesis can be inferred from the premise."
6057,'Go now.',Go on and kill. ,1,0,False,"step 1: in the premise, 'go now' is an imperative sentence that directly instructs someone to move or act. it does not provide any context or information about the action to be taken. the hypothesis, 'go on and kill', is a significantly different instruction that involves an act of violence.  step 2: there is no logical connection or entailment between the premise and hypothesis. 'go now' can mean many things, such as 'leave this place now', 'start this activity now', etc. 'go on and kill' implies an action that is not only different but also contradictory in nature to the original instruction. step 3: based on the lack of logical connection, common sense, and the significant difference in meaning between the premise and hypothesis, the hypothesis cannot be logically inferred from the premise."
6058,we're transmitting from from uh New England to Dallas Texas and i'm getting responses in in split seconds,We're digitally transmitting the fundraising flyers to a company in Dallas and getting a response back super fast. ,1,1,True,"step 1: in the premise, it is mentioned that there is a transmission from new england to dallas and that responses are being received in split seconds. this implies a fast communication channel.step 2: the hypothesis suggests that the transmission is digital and that it involves fundraising flyers being sent to a company in dallas. a fast communication channel is consistent with digital transmission. also, sending digital files such as fundraising flyers is a common practice.step 3: based on the given information, the hypothesis can be logically inferred from the premise. the premise does not explicitly state the method of transmission, but the fast response time and digital nature of the communication are consistent with the hypothesis.therefore, the hypothesis is a logical inference from the premise."
6059,A young girl has her hands in a tub of water with leaves in it.,A girl washes toys outside.,0,0,True,"step 1: in the premise, a young girl is shown to have her hands in a tub of water with leaves in it. this scene does not necessarily imply washing toys. however, the presence of water and the lack of specific details about the contents of the tub or the reason for the girl's actions suggest a possibility that she could be washing something. the presence of leaves in the tub does not contradict this possibility but does not provide sufficient evidence to support it either. common-sense understanding and logical principles do not allow us to infer the hypothesis directly from the premise.step 2: the hypothesis 'a girl washes toys outside' cannot be logically inferred from the premise 'a young girl has her hands in a tub of water with leaves in it' because the hypothesis introduces an additional element (toys being washed outside) that is not present or implied in the premise.step 3: based on the information provided, the hypothesis cannot be logically inferred from the premise and is assigned a label of 0."
6060,"The conventional populist critique of evolution identifies it with sex education, condom distribution, restrictions on school prayer, and other perceived liberal attacks on religion.",Evolution is still taught in all schools.,1,1,True,"step 1: in the premise, it is mentioned that the conventional populist critique identifies evolution with certain societal issues. this does not directly affect the factual accuracy of the statement that evolution is still taught in schools. the critique is a perception, not a factual statement. step 2: the hypothesis, 'evolution is still taught in all schools,' is a factual statement. it can be determined by checking various educational resources and institutions. step 3: although there are criticisms and perceptions linking evolution to certain societal issues, these criticisms do not logically negate or contradict the factual statement that evolution is still taught in schools. thus, the hypothesis can be considered independent from the premise. step 4: based on the evaluation of the facts and the logical independence of the hypothesis from the premise, the hypothesis is entailed by the premise with a label of 1, as the premise does not negate or contradict the hypothesis."
6061,Gerth's original piece in April said that the Pentagon believed Loral had significantly improved the reliability of China's nuclear missiles.,Gerth's original piece in April didn't say anything about the Pentagon.,0,0,True,"step 1: analyzing the premise, 'gerth's original piece in april said that the pentagon believed loral had significantly improved the reliability of china's nuclear missiles', we identify the key information that gerth's original piece in april stated something about the pentagon's belief regarding loral and the improvement of china's nuclear missiles reliability.step 2: the hypothesis, 'gerth's original piece in april didn't say anything about the pentagon', contradicts the premise. the hypothesis suggests that gerth's original piece did not mention the pentagon at all, whereas the premise states that the piece did mention the pentagon.step 3: based on the given information, the hypothesis cannot be logically inferred from the premise. the premise and hypothesis are contradictory, and the hypothesis is not a valid conclusion based on the information provided in the premise."
6062,The decline in the won caused further bankruptcies.,Further bankruptcies were caused by a famine.,0,0,True,"step 1: the premise indicates that a decline in the won (the currency of south korea) led to further bankruptcies. this implies a causal relationship between the weaker currency and financial instability. step 2: the hypothesis suggests that further bankruptcies were caused by a famine, which is a separate cause from a currency decline. the hypothesis introduces a new cause that is not mentioned or implied in the premise. step 3: based on the information provided, there does not seem to be a logical connection or common-sense reasoning that allows the hypothesis to be inferred from the premise. the hypothesis presents an unrelated cause for the bankruptcies.step 4: to determine if the hypothesis is entailed by the premise, we need to establish a logical relationship between the two. however, the hypothesis introduces a new and unrelated cause, making it not entailed by the premise.step 5: based on the logical analysis and lack of connection between the premise and hypothesis, the hypothesis cannot be logically inferred from the premise."
6063,So why persist in newspaper reading?,Why should stop newspaper reading?,0,0,True,"step 1: the premise is asking for reasons as to why someone continues to read newspapers. it does not imply an intention or desire to stop. the question is rhetorical in nature and does not provide any specific information about the speaker's intentions.step 2: the hypothesis, on the other hand, is asking for reasons as to why someone should not stop reading newspapers. this is a different question and cannot be directly inferred from the premise as it introduces an additional requirement of providing reasons for not doing something.step 3: based on the logical analysis, the hypothesis is not entailed by the premise as they ask for different types of reasons. the premise asks for reasons to continue reading newspapers and the hypothesis asks for reasons not to stop. they are related but distinct questions."
6065,By a.d.   1300 they had erased the vestiges of a Marquesan outpost and developed a Hawaiian society of their own.,By a.d. 1300 they already had a German society of their own.,0,0,True,"step 1. the premise describes the development of a hawaiian society by a.d. 1300, implying that the polynesians had established their own culture and erased any previous influences. step 2. the hypothesis suggests the existence of a german society in hawaii by a.d. 1300, which is not mentioned or implied in the premise. step 3. there is no logical connection between the premise and hypothesis as no fact or relationship is provided in the premise that would allow the hypothesis to be logically inferred. furthermore, the hypothesis contradicts the information provided in the premise. step 4. based on the information given and the logical inconsistency between the premise and hypothesis, the hypothesis cannot be inferred from the premise."
6066,"What happens then is an enchanting blend of old and new, as Finn is summoned to the manse of Nora Dinsmoor (Anne Bancroft), a filthy-rich ex-socialite driven mad by her abandonment, decades earlier, by a wayward fiance.",Nora Dinsmoor was left by her fiance for good reason.,1,1,True,"step 1: in the premise, finn is summoned to nora dinsmoor's manse due to her abandonment by a former fiance. the premise implies that nora's abandonment led her to a state of madness. step 2: the hypothesis suggests a reason why nora's fiance left her. this reason is not explicitly stated in the premise, but it does not contradict the information given. it is a reasonable inference that a wayward fiance might have left for a good reason, such as infidelity, abuse, or incompatibility. step 3: based on the logical principle of inferring a reasonable explanation for observable phenomena, and the lack of contradiction between the hypothesis and the premise, the hypothesis can be inferred from the premise."
6067,and splurge a little bit,We'll spend a lot of money.,1,1,True,"step 1: in the premise, the use of the phrase 'splurge a little bit' implies that there will be some unnecessary or excessive spending beyond what is necessary. this is consistent with the idea of 'spending a lot of money'. step 2: the hypothesis 'we'll spend a lot of money' is a clear and direct expression of the idea presented in the premise. the hypothesis is a specific instance of the more general idea presented in the premise, 'splurge a little bit'. step 3: based on the logical relationship between the premise and hypothesis, and the lack of contradictory information, the hypothesis can be inferred from the premise."
6068,A man in swimming trunks kicking a ball at the beach.,A man wearing swimming trunks plays around at the beach.,1,1,True,"step 1: in the premise, a man is described as being at the beach, wearing swimming trunks, and engaging in an activity of kicking a ball. this scenario is consistent with the common sense understanding of 'playing around' at the beach. there are no contradictory facts in the premise or hypothesis.step 2: the hypothesis 'a man wearing swimming trunks plays around at the beach' can be logically inferred from the premise. playing around typically involves engaging in various activities, and the man in the premise is doing just that by kicking a ball. the man's swimming trunks are also mentioned, which is consistent with the hypothesis as swimming trunks are often worn for beach activities.step 3: based on the logical reasoning, common sense understanding, and lack of contradictory facts, the hypothesis can be inferred from the premise."
6069,"The stadium has a maximum capacity of 31,452 people and was built in 2007.","The stadium has a maximum capacity of 31,453 people and was built in 2007.",0,0,True,"step 1. the premise states that the maximum capacity of the stadium is 31,452 people. the hypothesis also states that the maximum capacity of the stadium is 31,453 people. both the premise and hypothesis agree on the year of construction, which is 2007. step 2. while the hypothesis introduces an extra person in the maximum capacity figure, the difference between the two is minimal and does not contradict any logical or factual information provided in the premise. it is common for capacity figures to be rounded or estimated, which might result in slight variations between different sources. with this in mind, one could consider that the hypothesis is a reasonable approximation or estimation of the premise.step 3. the hypothesis can be considered equivalent to the premise based on common sense and real-world considerations, as the difference between the two is negligible and does not change the overall meaning or implications of the information.your reasoning may vary depending on specific contexts and applications, but this analysis provides a general framework for approaching the problem.therefore,"
6070,"Perhaps because Jerusalem was in neutral territory not allotted to any of the twelve rival tribes of Israel, David made it the capital of his newly formed kingdom and brought the most talented artisans, dedicated priests, magical poets and musicians, and the most formidable soldiers from each of the tribes to live in his city.",Jerusalem was neutral territory in the war.,1,1,True,"step 1: in the premise, it is stated that jerusalem was in neutral territory and that david made it the capital of his kingdom. this implies that jerusalem was not allotted to any of the twelve tribes of israel, suggesting a lack of control or ownership by any particular tribe. this is a reasonable context for territory to be considered neutral in the context of ancient warfare.step 2: the hypothesis aligns directly with the premise as it also states that jerusalem was neutral territory. the hypothesis can be logically inferred from the premise as the premise provides the context and background information that supports the hypothesis.step 3: based on the logical connection between the premise and hypothesis, common sense understanding of ancient warfare and territorial control, and the factual consistency of the information provided, the hypothesis is entailed by the premise."
6071,"In previous sections, capacity factors of 85 percent were assumed.",The next section we will carry on to assume the same capacity factors.,1,1,True,"step 1: the premise states that in previous sections, the capacity factors were assumed to be 85 percent. this suggests a consistent assumption made in the context of these sections. step 2: the hypothesis proposes that the same capacity factor assumption will be made in the next section. given the consistency in assumptions observed in the premise, it is a reasonable inference that the same assumption will be carried forward to the next section. step 3: based on the logical consistency of assuming the same capacity factor in both previous and upcoming sections, the hypothesis can be inferred from the premise."
6072,A response by the Postal Service would be expected.,The Postal Service is not expected to respond.,0,0,True,"step 1: in the premise, it is stated that a response by the postal service is expected. this implies that there is a situation or context where a response from the postal service is normal or required. step 2: in contrast, the hypothesis states that the postal service is not expected to respond. this suggests a scenario where no response from the postal service would be the norm or is desired. step 3: the hypothesis directly contradicts the premise. based on the logical negation of the premise, the hypothesis cannot be logically inferred from the premise. step 4: it's important to note that the absence of an action or event doesn't always mean it's expected not to occur. in this case, the premise and hypothesis describe different expectations. therefore, the hypothesis is not entailed by the premise."
6073,but she's she's usually pretty good,Shes always awful.,0,0,True,"step 1: in the premise, the statement 'she's usually pretty good' indicates that the person being referred to has a generally positive behavior or performance. this is a subjective evaluation based on the speaker's observation. step 2: the hypothesis 'she's always awful' contradicts the information in the premise by asserting that the person's behavior or performance is consistently negative. step 3: based on the contradiction between the premise and hypothesis and the lack of logical or factual connection between them, the hypothesis cannot be inferred from the premise.step 4: it is important to note that the premise and hypothesis might be referring to different situations or contexts, which could further complicate the inference. however, without such contextual information, it is safe to conclude that the hypothesis is not entailed by the premise."
6074,A host of legally significant distinctions separates aliens from citizens and national-security investigations from law-enforcement probes.,Aliens do not have the same rights as citizens when it comes to law enforcement investigations.,1,1,True,"step 1: the premise highlights the differences between aliens and citizens, and the differences between national-security investigations and law-enforcement probes. the distinction made between these two types of investigations implies that there may be different rules or considerations for each. it is a well-known fact that the legal rights of non-citizens can differ from those of citizens in various contexts, particularly in areas related to national security.step 2: the hypothesis aligns with the information in the premise, stating that aliens do not have the same rights as citizens when it comes to law enforcement investigations. this is a logical consequence of the distinctions drawn in the premise, as the premise suggests that there are differences in treatment between aliens and citizens in the context of investigations.step 3: based on the logical connections in the premise, common sense understanding of legal systems, and factual consistency, the hypothesis can be logically inferred from the premise."
6075,Tradition says two saints made an appearance at the funeral.,"According to tradition, five saints graced the funeral.",0,0,True,"step 1. in the premise, it is mentioned that 'tradition says two saints made an appearance at the funeral.' this statement indicates that there were at least two saints present. the hypothesis suggests 'five saints graced the funeral.' step 2. the hypothesis is not logically entailed by the premise, as it introduces a new piece of information that is not mentioned in the premise. it is not common sense that if two saints appear, five must also have. step 3. based on the logical reasoning, common sense, and lack of contradictory facts, the hypothesis cannot be inferred from the premise."
6076,"According to the attorneys who appear before her, Zelon succeeds in making everyone in her courtroom at ease.","According to attorneys, Zelon's courtroom is a tense and stressful place to be because of her. ",0,0,True,"step 1: in the premise, the attorneys' statements imply that zelon has a calming effect in her courtroom. this suggests that she creates an environment where people feel at ease. common sense and logical principles do not contradict this information. step 2: the hypothesis states that the courtroom is a tense and stressful place due to zelon. this directly contradicts the information provided in the premise, as the attorneys' statements indicate the opposite. step 3: based on the logical reasoning and the contradiction between the premise and hypothesis, the hypothesis is not entailed by the premise."
6077,In Loco Parentis Returnus,Located in Loco Parentis.,1,0,False,"step 1. the premise 'in loco parentis returnus' is a latin term meaning 'in the place of a parent'. it refers to a situation where an educator or guardian takes on the responsibilities of a parent, acting in the best interests of the child.step 2. the hypothesis 'located in loco parentis' is not logically entailed by the premise. 'located in' suggests a physical location, while 'in loco parentis' refers to a role or responsibility. the hypothesis does not follow logically from the premise as it introduces a new and unrelated concept.step 3. based on the logical analysis, the hypothesis 'located in loco parentis' cannot be inferred from the premise 'in loco parentis returnus'."
6078,Specificity was also poor.,Specificity was not the only thing doing poorly.,1,1,True,"step 1: the premise indicates that 'specificity was poor'. this means that the level of detail or clarity in the expression of certain information was insufficient.step 2: the hypothesis 'specificity was not the only thing doing poorly' suggests that there were other issues contributing to the poor performance or quality. while it doesn't directly contradict the premise, it does expand upon it by adding the context that other factors might have been involved.step 3: based on the given information, the hypothesis can be seen as a reasonable extension or elaboration of the premise. it doesn't contradict the premise and, in fact, might provide additional insights into the situation. since the hypothesis doesn't contradict the premise, it can be inferred as a possible outcome, given the information provided.step 4: in summary, the hypothesis 'specificity was not the only thing doing poorly' can be logically inferred from the premise as a valid extension or elaboration."
6079,"The Riviera di Ponente, west of Genoa toward the French border, is an almost continuous chain of family resorts.",Many families visit and stay in Riviera di Ponente.,1,1,True,"step 1: the premise describes the riviera di ponente as an almost continuous chain of family resorts. this implies that there are numerous family-oriented accommodations and attractions in this region. it is a common observation that families tend to visit and stay at such places for vacation.step 2: the hypothesis states that 'many families visit and stay in riviera di ponente'. this is a logical conclusion that can be inferred from the information presented in the premise. the presence of numerous family resorts in the riviera di ponente implies a high likelihood of families visiting and staying there.step 3: based on the logical connection between the premise and hypothesis, and the common-sense understanding that families are likely to visit and stay at family resorts, the hypothesis can be inferred from the premise."
6080,and it'll or you know or someone will transport them to a specific church even though it's you know maybe it's thirty minutes away because it's a big you know Dallas area is a big metropolitan area but a lot of these places have have churches or have have individual transportation that's that's something i'd look for something that would make me happy,Most churches in the Dallas area offer transportation. ,1,1,True,"step 1: in the premise, the speaker mentions that they or someone else will transport people to a church, which is thirty minutes away, despite the dallas area being a big metropolitan area with many churches. this implies that there are churches in the area that offer transportation. step 2: the hypothesis proposes that most churches in the dallas area offer transportation. this hypothesis is consistent with the information in the premise as it suggests that a significant number of churches in the dallas area do provide transportation. step 3: based on the information in the premise and the logical connection to the hypothesis, the hypothesis can be inferred from the premise."
6081,A boy with a basketballs glowers at the camera.,The boy is smiling,0,0,True,"step 1: the premise describes a boy holding basketballs and looking at the camera with a glowering expression. the term 'glowering' implies a look of anger, hostility, or displeasure. step 2: the hypothesis suggests an opposite emotion, a smile. a smile is a visible expression of happiness or contentment. step 3: the hypothesis contradicts the premise as the boy's glowering expression does not logically infer a smiling boy. step 4: the absence of any context or additional information in the premise or hypothesis that could potentially explain the discrepancy between the glowering expression and a smiling face further reinforces the lack of logical entailment. step 5: based on the given information, the hypothesis cannot be inferred from the premise."
6082,The number of boilermakers in demand for retrofit installations under the Clear Skies Act is spread fairly evenly out to 2010 when the demand begins to decrease.,The Clear Skies Act requires 500 boilermakers to retrofit installations. ,1,0,False,"step 1: in the premise, it is stated that the demand for boilermakers in retrofit installations under the clear skies act is spread fairly evenly until 2010, after which the demand begins to decrease. no specific number of boilermakers is mentioned.  step 2: in the hypothesis, it is suggested that the clear skies act requires 500 boilermakers for retrofit installations. however, the premise neither states nor implies this requirement.  step 3: based on the information provided, the hypothesis cannot be logically inferred from the premise. the premise only describes the demand trend for boilermakers under the clear skies act, while the hypothesis introduces a new requirement that is not based on the information given in the premise.  step 4: since the hypothesis is not logically entailed by the premise, and there is no contradiction between the two, the label should be 0."
6083,um he grew up out well he grew up in Le Ren which is the sort of um oh strip east to west eastern part of France,He always go back to Le Ren during vacations.,1,0,False,"step 1: in the premise, we learn that 'he' grew up in le ren, which is an eastern part of france. no specific information about his current location or vacation habits is provided. step 2: the hypothesis suggests that 'he' always goes back to le ren during vacations. this is a statement about his current habits or actions during vacation time. step 3: based on the given premise, we cannot logically infer the hypothesis as there is no clear link between the two. the premise only provides information about 'he' growing up in le ren, whereas the hypothesis makes a statement about his vacation habits. without further context or information, the hypothesis cannot be inferred from the premise."
6084,"He'll never know, said Julius.",Julius kissed her with a fervor after speaking.,1,0,False,"step 1: in the premise, julius made a statement 'he'll never know'. it does not provide any information about julius' actions or emotions following the statement. the hypothesis, however, describes an action 'kissed her with a fervor' that julius took after making the statement.step 2: the hypothesis cannot be logically inferred from the premise as the premise does not provide enough information to deduce that julius engaged in a kissing behavior after speaking. the hypothesis introduces a new fact that is not mentioned or implied in the premise.step 3: based on the given information, there is no entailment between the premise and the hypothesis."
6085,"No wonder, then, that right-wingers think of PBS as liberal and lefties regard it as a corporate/conservative tool.",Reality has a known liberal bias and that's why PBS appears so.,1,0,False,"step 1: in the premise, it is stated that right-wingers and lefties have opposing perceptions of pbs. this suggests a subjective perspective based on individual biases or ideologies. there is no factual information provided about pbs itself or its supposed liberal or conservative bias.step 2: the hypothesis introduces a new concept, 'reality having a known liberal bias', which is not mentioned or implied in the premise. it is an unwarranted assumption, as there is no evidence or logical connection to the premise.step 3: based on the information provided in the premise, the hypothesis cannot be logically inferred as it introduces a new and unrelated concept.step 4: the hypothesis is not entailed by the premise, as it goes beyond the given information and introduces a new, unsupported assumption."
6086,"Fascinating details such as Bonnie Prince Charlie's traveling canteen of cutlery, along with his sword and targe (a small bag), bring history to life.",The Prince never traveled with anything on him.,0,0,True,"step 1: in the premise, it is mentioned that bonnie prince charlie carried various historical items like a traveling canteen of cutlery, a sword, and a targe. this implies that he traveled with these belongings. step 2: the hypothesis states that the prince never traveled with anything on him. this contradicts the premise, as the premise explicitly states that he did travel with belongings. step 3: based on the logical negation of the facts given in the premise, the hypothesis is not entailed by the premise."
6087,He stood by the screen with his face in shadow.,He stood next to the screen in the living room. ,1,0,False,"step 1: the premise describes a person standing with his face in shadow near a screen. this does not necessarily imply a specific location or context, and the term 'screen' could refer to various types of screens such as a television, a movie screen, or even a computer screen. the hypothesis suggests the person standing next to a screen in a living room.step 2: the hypothesis cannot be logically inferred from the premise, as the premise does not contain enough information to support the hypothesis. the hypothesis introduces the 'living room' context, which is not mentioned in the premise.step 3: based on the given information, the hypothesis cannot be reasonably inferred from the premise."
6088,"It includes insurance for losses from accident, medical expense, accidental death and dismemberment "" p. 225.","It includes insurance for losses from accident, medical expense, disability, or accidental death and dismemberment"" (p. 225).",1,1,True,"step 1. both the premise and hypothesis describe insurance coverage for various types of losses. the key information in the premise includes 'insurance', 'losses', 'accident', 'medical expense', 'accidental death', and 'dismemberment'. the hypothesis adds 'disability' as another potential loss. the premise does not contradict the hypothesis as both contain the same core elements.step 2. the hypothesis can be logically inferred from the premise because 'disability' is a type of loss that is related to the other losses mentioned in the premise. disability is often considered in insurance policies as it can result from accidents and can lead to medical expenses and financial hardship. the hypothesis expands upon the premise by including an additional but related type of loss.step 3. based on the logical reasoning, the hypothesis is a reasonable and necessary expansion of the information given in the premise. therefore, the hypothesis is entailed by the premise."
6089,"In 2013, Schemel joined the indie rock group Upset, formed by Ali Koehler, previously of Vivian Girls and Best Coast.","In 2013, Schemel joined the indie rock group Upset, formed by Ali Koehler, previously of Best Coast.",0,1,False,"step 1: both the premise and hypothesis describe the same event, which is schemel joining the indie rock group upset in 2013. the key difference between the two sentences lies in the mention of vivian girls instead of best coast in the premise. however, ali koehler was a member of both best coast and vivian girls, so this difference is not significant. step 2: the hypothesis can be logically inferred from the premise as the premise does not contradict the hypothesis in any way. in fact, the hypothesis is a more specific version of the premise, including the additional information about ali koehler's previous band membership in best coast. step 3: given the logical equivalence between the premise and hypothesis and the lack of contradiction, the hypothesis is entailed by the premise."
6090,we had a personal experience with something like that it wasn't didn't go as far as murder but this this girl young girl had uh she had gotten hold of a gun and she came around to the office where my wife worked and she was she had this mental problem with uh with a doctor she works for him and uh he was she was just after him you know and the cops pick her up,The girl tried to shoot the man she was after.,1,1,True,"step 1: in the premise, we learn about an incident where a young girl, due to a mental problem, came to the office with a gun intending to harm a man she was after. this man is a doctor she has issues with. step 2: the hypothesis suggests that the girl tried to shoot the man, which aligns with the information in the premise as it indicates the girl's intent was to harm the man. the hypothesis is a logical conclusion that could follow from the premise. step 3: based on the logical connection between the premise and hypothesis, the hypothesis can be inferred from the premise."
6091,"They are designed, above all, to indulge the national sense of style.",The national sense of style is highly varied.,1,1,True,"step 1: in the premise, it is stated that 'they' (presumably, certain objects or entities) are designed to indulge the national sense of style. this implies that there are various things that embody and cater to different national styles. step 2: the hypothesis, 'the national sense of style is highly varied', is consistent with the premise as it suggests that there are many different styles that can be indulged. step 3: given the premise, which implies a variety of national styles, and the hypothesis, which explicitly states that the national sense of style is varied, the hypothesis can be logically inferred from the premise. step 4: based on the logical reasoning, the premise and hypothesis are consistent and the hypothesis can be inferred from the premise."

6095,"On the western flank of the square, West Register House, designed originally as a church (St.",West Register House never was a church.  ,0,0,True,"step 1. the premise establishes that west register house is located on the western side of a square and was designed originally as a church. this information is factual and consistent. step 2. the hypothesis directly contradicts the premise by stating that west register house never was a church. contradictory hypotheses cannot be logically inferred from their contradictory premises. step 3. based on the logical inconsistency between the premise and the hypothesis, the hypothesis cannot be inferred from the premise."
6096,"Now we gotta make some yogurt with a natural kefir flavor with pieces of fresh fruit, you know, those from that delivery from three years back, that's been sitting all this time, because it was too sweet,' the CEO announced and Szary now knew for sure that the day would only be one of those very bad ones.",Szary knew that this day was going to be a great one.,0,0,True,"step 1: in the premise, the ceo is announcing a plan to make yogurt using old, potentially spoiled fruit. the tone of the premise is negative, with the ceo expressing certainty that the day would be 'one of those very bad ones'. step 2: the hypothesis proposes a directly opposite sentiment - that szary knew this day was going to be great. this contradicts the premise as there is no information in the premise suggesting anything positive about the day. step 3: based on the given information, the hypothesis cannot be logically inferred from the premise as it goes against the facts and sentiment presented in the premise."
6097,The house has been fully restored and offers an excellent example of fine Cairene architecture.,The house is still an ruins today and no effort has been made to restore it.,0,0,True,"step 1: in the premise, the house is described as having been fully restored and being an excellent example of cairene architecture. this implies that the house is in a good condition and that restoration work has been completed. step 2: in contrast, the hypothesis states that the house is still in ruins and no effort has been made to restore it. this directly contradicts the information in the premise, as it suggests that the restoration work did not occur. step 3: based on the contradictory nature of the hypothesis and the premise, the hypothesis cannot be logically inferred from the premise."
6098,because see that's where it's coming from to me it it's coming in here some kind of way i don't care what anybody tells me people tell me i said if the government really want to i think it's all government something to do with the government i really do,I think the government are trying to over charge me for tax,1,0,False,"step 1: in the premise, the speaker expresses their belief that something is related to the government and that they are being overcharged for tax. this belief is not explicitly stated as being about a specific tax or the reason for the overcharge. however, it does suggest a suspicion or accusation towards the government.step 2: the hypothesis also expresses a belief about the government, specifically that they are trying to overcharge the speaker for tax. this belief shares common ground with the premise as they both involve the government and taxes. however, the hypothesis goes a step further by suggesting a specific reason for the overcharge.step 3: while the hypothesis does not logically follow from the premise as there is no direct evidence or explicit statement in the premise about the government's intent to overcharge, the hypothesis is a reasonable inference based on the information provided. the premise suggests that the speaker believes there is something suspicious or wrong about the tax situation, and the hypothesis offers a possible explanation. common sense reasoning also supports this inference, as it is not uncommon for people to suspect government agencies of overcharging or misusing taxpayer funds.step 4: however, it is important to note that the hypothesis is not a logical entailment of the premise, as the premise does not provide sufficient evidence to definitively prove the hypothesis. it is only a reasonable inference based on the information given and common sense reasoning."
6099,"Amos Lutterfield he is what one might term a character, a strange one.",Amos Lutterfield is a pretty common character.,0,0,True,"step 1: in the premise, amos lutterfield is described as a 'character,' which is generally a term used to denote someone who has distinct and interesting personality traits. this description is subjective and open to interpretation. the term 'strange' further emphasizes amos's uniqueness. there's no factual or logical inconsistency with the premise.step 2: the hypothesis, 'amos lutterfield is a pretty common character,' contradicts the premise. 'common' implies ordinary, unremarkable, or typical. amos's character, as described in the premise, is anything but common. the two sentences convey opposite meanings.step 3: based on the logical analysis, the hypothesis cannot be inferred from the premise because they convey contradictory meanings."
6100,"While the nearby Malwa and Gujarat came under Muslim rule, Rajputana remained Hindu.",Gujarant and Malwa came under Muslim however Rajputana had remained independent to remain Hindu.,1,1,True,"step 1: in the premise, it is stated that malwa and gujarat came under muslim rule, while rajputana remained hindu. this implies that rajputana was not ruled by muslims at the same time as malwa and gujarat. step 2: the hypothesis states that gujarat and malwa came under muslim rule, but rajputana remained independent and therefore remained hindu. this hypothesis is logically consistent with the premise, as it does not contradict any information provided in the premise. in fact, it adds additional detail about rajputana's independence. step 3: based on the logical consistency of the hypothesis with the premise, and the lack of contradictory information, the hypothesis can be inferred from the premise."
6101,"Burke believed that the principles shared by party members should bind them together, even when they encounter particular differences about their application (and despite some blurring of lines, party members do still ). Indeed, representatives owe it to the voters not to discard the party line for personal gain.",Burke believed that differences encountered by party members were insignificant.,1,0,False,"step 1: burke's belief in the importance of party principles and the obligation of representatives to uphold those principles despite differences suggests a recognition of the significance of these differences. the fact that he acknowledges that there are differences and that they can blur lines further emphasizes this.step 2: the hypothesis, 'burke believed that differences encountered by party members were insignificant,' contradicts the understanding of burke's beliefs derived from the premise. a belief in insignificant differences would not necessitate the need for party members to uphold the party line and would not require representatives to owe voters an allegiance to those principles.step 3: based on the information provided in the premise, the hypothesis cannot be logically inferred, as it contradicts the given understanding of burke's beliefs."
6102,"Have you ever known a chemist to send out a box like that, without his printed name?",The chemist sent the box out with his printed name on it. ,0,0,True,"step 1: in the premise, it is stated that a chemist sent out a box without his printed name. this implies that the name was missing or absent from the box. step 2: the hypothesis suggests that the chemist sent the box with his printed name on it. this is the opposite of the information given in the premise. step 3: based on the information provided, it is not possible to logically infer the hypothesis from the premise as they contradict each other. the premise states that the chemist's name was not on the box, while the hypothesis suggests that it was."
6103,"For example, one state government CIO organization that we studied experienced a 22 percent turnover in IT professionals.",During our study we did not find any CIO organizations that listed a IT turnover percent greater than 2%.,0,0,True,"step 1: in the premise, a specific example of a 22 percent turnover in it professionals within a state government cio organization is given. this turnover percentage is not typical, as indicated in the hypothesis with no cio organizations having a greater turnover.step 2: the hypothesis contradicts the premise, as the hypothesis states that no cio organizations had a greater turnover, while the premise describes an instance where such a turnover occurred. this contradiction makes it impossible for the hypothesis to be logically inferred from the premise.step 3: based on the logical analysis, the hypothesis is not entailed by the premise."
6104,"Commissioner Will--it's an appealing  He negotiates contracts, he stifles owners, he builds ballparks, he quotes Walter Bagehot.",The commissioner Tamara negotiates contracts. ,0,1,False,"step 1: in the premise, commissioner will is described as a person who negotiates contracts, stifles owners, builds ballparks, and quotes walter bagehot. no specific gender is mentioned.step 2: the hypothesis states that commissioner tamara negotiates contracts. this information is consistent with the premise as it does not contradict any statements made about commissioner will. there is no indication in the premise that commissioner will is the only person who negotiates contracts in the context provided.step 3: based on the given information, it cannot be definitively concluded that tamara is the same person as will, but the hypothesis can be logically inferred from the premise as the premise does not restrict negotiation of contracts to commissioner will alone.step 4: since the hypothesis is a logical consequence of the premise, it is entailed by the premise."
6105,"The Chawk (bazaar) is famous for its perfumes, silks, and brassware.","In a addition to perfumes, silks and brassware, you take in local cuisine at the bazaar.",1,1,True,"step 1: in the premise, it is mentioned that the chawk (bazaar) is famous for its perfumes, silks, and brassware. this means that these are the primary items that the bazaar is known for and attracts customers. step 2: the hypothesis states that not only perfumes, silks, and brassware are available but also local cuisine can be taken in at the bazaar. this is a reasonable extension of the known facts, as bazaars are often known for their diverse offerings and local cuisine is a common feature in many markets and commercial areas. step 3: based on the logical reasoning, the hypothesis can be inferred from the premise as it does not contradict any information provided in the premise and extends the known offerings at the bazaar."
6106,A teenage girl in winter clothes slides down a decline in a red sled.,A girl is on a beach with a blue sled.,0,0,True,"step 1. in the premise, we have a girl in winter clothes sliding down a decline using a red sled. this scene suggests a winter setting. common sense tells us that girls do not typically wear winter clothes or use red sleds on beaches. the hypothesis describes a completely different scenario, as it implies a beach and a blue sled. step 2. the hypothesis cannot be logically inferred from the premise, as the premise does not provide any information or details that support the hypothesis. the hypothesis contradicts the premise, as it states that the girl is on a beach, which is not mentioned or implied in the premise. step 3. based on the logical analysis and the clear contradiction between the premise and hypothesis, the hypothesis is not entailed by the premise."
6107,"North along the Corso Garibaldi is Padua's undisputed draw, the 14th-century Scrovegni Chapel, also known, due to its site among ruins of a Roman amphitheater, as the Arena Chapel.",The Scrovegni Chapel was built in Roman times.,0,0,True,"step 1: in the premise, the scrovegni chapel is described as a 14th-century structure located along corso garibaldi in padua. the chapel is also referred to as the arena chapel due to its proximity to roman ruins.step 2: the hypothesis stating that the scrovegni chapel was built in roman times contradicts the information given in the premise. the premise specifies the chapel as a 14th-century structure, and there is no mention or implication that it was built during roman times. the proximity of the chapel to roman ruins does not signify that it was constructed during that era.step 3: based on the logical reasoning, the hypothesis that the scrovegni chapel was built in roman times is not entailed by the premise."
6108,"When I use a word, Humpty Dumpty said in rather a scornful tone, it means just what I choose it to mean--neither more nor less.",Humpty Dumpty was yelling at his friends.,1,0,False,"step 1: in the premise, humpty dumpty is stated to have said that he can give any meaning to the words he uses. this statement does not provide any specific context about the situation or the people involved, including whether humpty dumpty was yelling or not.step 2: the hypothesis, humpty dumpty was yelling at his friends, is not logically entailed by the premise. while the premise does not rule out the possibility, there is no direct logical connection between the two statements.step 3: based on the given information, the hypothesis cannot be logically inferred from the premise."
6109,"Moreover, many of these agencies find themselves without a clear understanding of who they are or where they are headed.",Every agency has a very clear understanding of where they are going.,0,0,True,"step 1: in the premise, it is stated that 'many of these agencies' lack a clear understanding of their identity and direction. this implies a lack of clarity or confusion among some, but not all, of these agencies. step 2: the hypothesis, 'every agency has a very clear understanding of where they are going', is directly contradictory to the premise. it asserts that all agencies, not just some, have a clear understanding of their direction. step 3: based on the logical negation of the hypothesis with respect to the premise, the hypothesis is not entailed by the premise."
6111,A couch sits broken while a man sits a table behind them.,The bed is broken,0,0,True,"step 1: the premise describes a scene with a broken couch and a man sitting at a table behind it. there is no direct mention of a bed in the scene. commonsense understanding and logical connection do not allow us to infer the state of a bed from the given information. step 2: the hypothesis makes a claim about the state of a bed, which is not related to the premise. the hypothesis contradicts the given information, as no information about the bed is provided. step 3: based on the lack of logical connection and the contradiction to the premise, the hypothesis cannot be inferred from the premise."
6112,"Thus, when auditors disclose matters that have led them to conclude that an illegal act is likely to have occurred, they should not imply that they have made a determination of illegality.",This is because it makes it look like the auditor lacks impartiality.,1,1,True,"step 1: in the premise, it is stated that auditors should not imply a determination of illegality when disclosing matters that may suggest an illegal act. the reason given is to maintain impartiality. step 2: the hypothesis suggests that the reason auditors should not imply a determination of illegality is because it could make them appear lacking in impartiality. the hypothesis is consistent with the information given in the premise and does not contradict it in any way. step 3: based on the logical consistency and the lack of contradiction between the premise and hypothesis, the hypothesis can be inferred from the premise as it explains the same reason for the given action or instruction."
6113,maybe just do our best to to do our own fair share and,In this one case we should work diligently to shoulder our portion of the burden and produce our best work.,1,1,True,"step 1: in the premise, the suggestion is made for individuals to do their best and contribute fairly. 'doing our own fair share' implies a commitment to putting effort into a task or situation. the hypothesis reiterates this idea but focuses on a specific instance and emphasizes the importance of producing the best work possible in that situation. both sentences share the common theme of individuals contributing and striving for quality.step 2: the hypothesis can be logically inferred from the premise. the premise sets the expectation for individuals to contribute fairly and do their best. in the specific case outlined in the hypothesis, individuals are doing their best and working diligently to meet or exceed this expectation. this is a logical extension of the premise.step 3: based on the logical connections, common sense understanding, and factual consistency between the premise and hypothesis, the hypothesis can be inferred from the premise."
6115,and he's their head chauffeur is this funny as they're parking the cars the valet service,They're parking the cars in the guarded parking lot.,1,0,False,"step 1. the premise describes a scene where a man named 'he' is the head chauffeur for a valet service, and they are parking cars. step 2. the hypothesis suggests that they are parking the cars in a guarded parking lot. parking lots can be guarded or unguarded. the premise does not explicitly state that the parking lot is guarded or unguarded.step 3. the hypothesis cannot be logically inferred from the premise because the premise does not provide sufficient information to deduce the presence or absence of a guarded parking lot. the premise only establishes that they are parking cars as part of their valet service duties. therefore, the hypothesis is not entailed by the premise."
6116,A teenage girl in winter clothes slides down a decline in a red sled.,A girl is sliding on a red sled.,1,1,True,"step 1: in the premise, a teenage girl is identified as sliding down a decline on a red sled. this implies that the girl is engaging in the activity of sliding on a sled, and the red color of the sled is mentioned as a distinct feature. step 2: the hypothesis only states that a 'girl is sliding on a red sled'. this hypothesis is exactly equivalent to the premise. therefore, the hypothesis can be logically inferred from the premise as it captures all the essential information from the premise. step 3: based on the logical equivalence of the premise and hypothesis, the hypothesis is entailed by the premise."
6117,a man with a blue jacket look at items.,A woman shops at Tiffany's.,0,0,True,"step 1: in the premise, we have a man looking at items. there is no specific information about the location or the nature of the items. the hypothesis mentions nothing about the man or the items. it only states that a woman shops at tiffany's.step 2: since there is no logical connection between the man and the woman, no relationship between the man's actions (looking at items) and the woman shopping at tiffany's is implied. the hypothesis does not follow logically from the premise.step 3: based on the given information, the hypothesis is not entailed by the premise."
6118,A group of men are playing rugby in a field with houses visible in the distance.,The men are at a sports bar,0,0,True,"step 1: in the premise, a group of men are playing rugby in a field. the description of a field with houses visible in the distance provides context, but it does not directly relate to the men playing rugby or their location being a sports bar. common sense and factual knowledge do not suggest that playing rugby in a field implies being at a sports bar. step 2: the hypothesis 'the men are at a sports bar' contradicts the premise 'a group of men are playing rugby in a field' because rugby is typically played outdoors on a field, not indoors at a sports bar. step 3: based on the logical reasoning and the clear contradiction between the premise and hypothesis, the hypothesis is not entailed by the premise."
6119,"Whatever else may be said about them, both Talmudic and Jesuitical carry connotations of great learning and meticulous attention to argument.",It's also said that Talmudic is better than Jesuitical for many reasons.,1,0,False,"step 1: both the premise and hypothesis refer to the talmud and jesuitic traditions, which are known for their deep learning and careful argumentation. no contradictory information is provided in the premise.step 2: the hypothesis goes beyond the premise by stating that 'it's also said that talmudic is better than jesuitical for many reasons.' this implies an evaluation or comparison between the two traditions, which is not explicitly stated or logical entailment of the premise.step 3: while it's possible for someone to hold the belief expressed in the hypothesis based on their personal opinion or knowledge, it's not a logical entailment from the premise. the premise only establishes that both traditions share certain characteristics, it does not provide any evidence or argument that one is superior to the other. therefore, the hypothesis cannot be logically inferred from the premise.step 4: a hypothesis that contradicts or goes beyond the logical extent of the premise should be labeled as 0 for no entailment."
6120,"Primarily a central defender, he has previously also been used as a defensive midfielder or a left back.","Primarily a central defender, he has previously also been used as a defensive midfielder or a left forward.",1,0,False,"step 1: in the premise, it is stated that the person in question is primarily a central defender and has experience playing as a defensive midfielder or a left back. this implies a versatile player with a defensive role. step 2: the hypothesis suggests a different offensive position, 'left forward', for this player. while it is not impossible for a versatile defender to have experience in attacking positions, the hypothesis presents a significant shift in the player's role on the field. step 3: based on the given information, there is no logical connection or entailment between the premise and the hypothesis. the hypothesis introduces a new piece of information that is not directly implied or suggested in the premise."
6121,"Other examples of this language are Ös and Tofa, whose speakers were, respectively, banned from speaking the language.","Other examples of this language are Ös and Tofa, whose speakers were, respectively, ridiculed for or banned from speaking the language.",1,1,True,"step 1: in the premise, it is mentioned that the speakers of ös and tofa languages were banned from speaking their languages. this implies some form of restriction or suppression.step 2: the hypothesis suggests an additional detail, that the speakers were also ridiculed for or banned from speaking the language. this can be seen as a stronger or more extreme form of suppression.step 3: the hypothesis is consistent with the premise as provided because the premise itself does not rule out the possibility of ridicule in addition to the ban. in fact, ridicule could be a reason why the ban was imposed. therefore, the hypothesis is a logical entailment of the premise, as it represents a more specific or detailed version of the premise's information."
6122,"He expected to be sent to the deepest, dankest cave of all the world as a laboratory, and to find it equipped with pedigreed bats, dried unicorn horns and whole rows of alembics that he couldn't use.",He needed a sterile lab and the right chemicals and tools.,1,1,True,"step 1: in the premise, the man is described as expecting to be sent to a deep, dank cave, which is equipped with pedigreed bats, dried unicorn horns, and rows of alembics. the presence of these items suggests a laboratory setting. it is common sense and logical that a laboratory would require a sterile environment, as well as the right chemicals and tools for experiments.step 2: the hypothesis 'he needed a sterile lab and the right chemicals and tools' can be logically inferred from the premise. the man's expectation of finding a laboratory with specific items indicates that he required these items for his work. the presence of the items in the premise implies a laboratory setting, which in turn requires a sterile environment and the right tools and chemicals.step 3: based on the logical reasoning and the common-sense understanding of laboratory requirements, the hypothesis can be inferred from the premise."
6123,"Her career was initially focused on the Japanese market, but her work became focused in South Korea from 2009 to 2010.","Her career was initially focused on the Japanese market, but her work became focused in South Korea from 2000 to 2010.",0,0,True,"step 1: in the premise, it is stated that her career was initially focused on the japanese market, and later, her work shifted to south korea from 2009 to 2010. step 2: the hypothesis suggests a similar scenario, but with a different time frame: her initial focus on japan and a subsequent shift to south korea, but during the years 2000 to 2010. step 3: while the general structure and logic of the hypothesis are similar to the premise, the difference in time frames makes it impossible to logically infer the hypothesis from the premise without additional information. the hypothesis does not contradict the premise, but it is not entailed by it either. step 4: in order for the hypothesis to be logically inferred from the premise, the premise would need to explicitly state that her work in south korea during the years 2000 to 2009 was still a part of her career that was initially focused on the japanese market. without this additional information, the hypothesis cannot be logically inferred from the premise."
6124,It operates several times a day during the summer.,It is not open in the summer.,0,0,True,"step 1: in the premise, it is stated that 'it' operates several times a day during the summer. this implies that 'it' is functional or active during the summer months. step 2: the hypothesis, 'it is not open in the summer', contradicts the information provided in the premise. the statement 'it is not open' implies that 'it' is not functional or inaccessible during the summer. step 3: based on the logical analysis of the given information, the hypothesis 'it is not open in the summer' cannot be logically inferred from the premise 'it operates several times a day during the summer' as they are contradictory."
6125,And so its tale is truly tragic.,Its tale is nothing less than tragic.,0,1,False,"step 1: both the premise and hypothesis convey the idea that the tale is tragic. the premise sets up a tragic tone by using the phrase 'truly tragic.' the hypothesis uses the phrase 'nothing less than tragic,' which is a stronger way of expressing the same idea. this suggests a high degree of similarity between the two sentences.step 2: the hypothesis can be logically inferred from the premise because the premise implies that the tale has tragic elements, and the hypothesis asserts that the tale is tragic in its entirety. the hypothesis does not contradict the premise but rather amplifies it.step 3: based on the logical reasoning, the similarity of meaning between the two sentences, and the lack of contradictory information, the hypothesis can be inferred from the premise."
6126,Poirot went on. ,Poiroit went on about the day.,1,0,False,"step 1: in the premise, 'poirot went on' is an ambiguous phrase that could refer to various actions such as continuing a conversation, traveling, or even thinking. however, without further context, it is unclear what 'going on' specifically means. step 2: the hypothesis 'poirot went on about the day' adds the detail that poirot was talking about the day, which is a possible interpretation of 'going on' but not the only one. however, the hypothesis does not logically follow from the premise because the premise does not limit 'going on' to talking about the day. step 3: based on the lack of clear entailment, the hypothesis cannot be logically inferred from the premise."
6127,"The French mock the British, the British mock the French, the Serbs kill the Albanians, the Albanians kill the Serbs--ah, that crazy regional humor.",Another example are the Indians cursing the Pakistanis and the Pakistanis cursing the Indians.,1,1,True,"step 1: in the premise, there are descriptions of various ethnic groups engaging in mockery and violence towards each other. these actions are presented as part of a regional context. the hypothesis describes similar interactions between the indians and pakistanis. step 2: the hypothesis can be logically inferred from the premise because the relationships described in the premise (mutual mockery and conflict) are not limited to specific ethnic groups, but rather seem to be a pattern in the region. there is no contradictory information in the premise that would prevent the inference of the hypothesis. step 3: based on the logical analysis and the lack of contradictory information, the hypothesis can be inferred from the premise."
6128,"Then the three were asked to comment on these past thoughts (none found any errors, of course).","Several people were asked to comment on the future thoughts, and they found several errors.",0,0,True,"step 1: in the premise, it is stated that 'three' people were asked to comment on 'these past thoughts' and none of them found any errors. 'three' is a specific number, implying a limited group of people. 'these past thoughts' likely refers to thoughts or ideas that had been previously expressed or recorded. step 2: the hypothesis, however, suggests a different scenario where 'several people' were asked to comment on 'future thoughts.' it is clear that the hypothesis does not follow logically from the premise as it introduces new elements, such as 'several people' and 'future thoughts.' step 3: based on the provided information, there is no logical connection between the premise and hypothesis. the hypothesis is not entailed by the premise, and it contradicts the premise in several aspects."
6129,so but  so yeah we just haven't had the time to go to the movies  lately,"We have been swamped with work of late, and free time is considered a rare luxury.",1,1,True,"step 1: in the premise, the speakers mention that they haven't had time to go to the movies lately. this implies a lack of free time due to some other commitment. in the hypothesis, the speakers are described as being 'swamped with work' and having 'free time (considered) a rare luxury.' this meaning is consistent with the lack of free time implied in the premise. there are no known facts that contradict the premise or hypothesis. step 2: the hypothesis can be logically inferred from the premise. the lack of free time in the premise directly implies the 'swamped with work' condition in the hypothesis. step 3: based on the logical reasoning and lack of contradictory facts, the hypothesis is entailed by the premise."
6130,and then you can add cocoa powder to it to make chocolate or after it's thickened i cook it for a good once it starts boiling i just i cook it for a good seven minutes,I like to make the cocoa and then drink it with whipped cream.,1,0,False,"step 1. in the premise, the speaker describes the process of making cocoa by adding cocoa powder to water and cooking it until it thickens. no restrictions or conditions are mentioned regarding the consumption of the cocoa. step 2. the hypothesis suggests an alternative use of the cocoa, which is to drink it with whipped cream after making it. this does not contradict the process described in the premise as there is no mention of the cocoa being consumed differently during the described process. step 3. the hypothesis does not logically follow from the premise as the premise does not specify how the cocoa is consumed, and the hypothesis describes an additional action (adding whipped cream) not mentioned in the premise. however, the hypothesis is not in contradiction with the premise as the process of making the cocoa can still be followed to make the chocolate with whipped cream. step 4. in conclusion, the hypothesis 'i like to make the cocoa and then drink it with whipped cream' is not logically entailed by the premise 'and then you can add cocoa powder to it to make chocolate or after it's thickened i cook it for a good once it starts boiling i just i cook it for a good seven minutes'."
6131,"After a few months, trouble begins to brew--invariably with her supervisor.",No trouble was brewing with her supervisor.,0,0,True,"step 1: in the premise, 'trouble begins to brew--invariably with her supervisor', the subject 'trouble' refers to some form of conflict or difficulty. the time frame 'after a few months' indicates that this conflict or difficulty has not yet occurred at the time of the statement, but is expected to start. step 2: the hypothesis 'no trouble was brewing with her supervisor' contradicts the premise, as it states that no conflict or difficulty was present with her supervisor at that time. step 3: based on the logical negation of the premise, the hypothesis is not entailed by the premise."
6132,"Mr. Inglethorp is quite willing to leave it entirely to Mr. Wells and myself.""",Mr. Inglethorp would like to handle everything himself.,0,0,True,"step 1: the premise states that mr. inglethorp is willing to let mr. wells and the speaker handle things without his involvement. this implies a delegation of responsibility and trust in their abilities. step 2: the hypothesis suggests the opposite of what the premise states, with mr. inglethorp wanting to handle everything himself. this contradicts the information given in the premise. step 3: based on the logical analysis, the hypothesis cannot be inferred from the premise as they are in direct contradiction to each other."
6133,two puppies playing around in the grass,two puppies outdoors.,1,1,True,"step 1: in the premise, 'two puppies playing around in the grass' implies that the two puppies are located in an outdoor environment. the term 'grass' is typically associated with outdoor settings. no contradictory information is present in the premise or hypothesis.step 2: the hypothesis 'two puppies outdoors' is a more general statement than the premise. it logically follows from the premise since the premise already establishes the outdoor setting.step 3: based on the logical relationship between the premise and hypothesis, the hypothesis can be inferred from the premise."
6134,the most common religion is Roman Catholic.,"Most of the population is classified as mestizo (63,2%) and the most common religion is Roman Catholic.",1,0,False,"step 1: in the premise, it is stated that the most common religion is roman catholic. there is no information about the population's ethnicity or demographic distribution. step 2: in the hypothesis, it is stated that most of the population is mestizo (63.2%) and roman catholic is the most common religion. the information about the population being mestizo does not contradict or affect the premise. step 3: the hypothesis does not follow directly from the premise, as there is no logical connection between the percentage of the mestizo population and the prevalence of roman catholicism in the premise. however, it is a factually possible scenario, as there are countries with significant mestizo populations and high percentages of roman catholics, such as mexico. so, while the hypothesis is not logically inferred from the premise, it is not contradictory either. step 4: based on the given information and logical reasoning, the hypothesis cannot be determined to be entailed by the premise, as there is no logical connection between the two statements."
6135,"The puritan crusaders of the North and the alienated populists of the South may share common political enemies, but little else.","However, the norther crusaders have much in common with the socialists in the west. ",1,0,False,"step 1: in the premise, the focus is on the political differences and common enemies between the puritan crusaders of the north and the alienated populists of the south. no explicit commonalities are mentioned between these groups. step 2: the hypothesis introduces a new element, stating that the puritan crusaders of the north have commonalities with socialists in the west. this suggestion contradicts the information provided in the premise. step 3: based on the given information, the hypothesis cannot be logically inferred from the premise as it goes beyond the stated facts and introduces new information that contradicts the premise."
6136,no i mean there there there was nothing to it i mean,I did it because I wanted to and I could.,1,0,False,"step 1: in the premise, there is a lack of clear information or actions described. it's essentially stating that there was no particular reason or event mentioned. the hypothesis, on the other hand, asserts a specific reason for an action - 'i wanted to and i could'. step 2: given the lack of information in the premise, it does not logically entail or contradict the hypothesis. there is no direct connection between the two statements. step 3: based on the information provided, the hypothesis cannot be inferred from the premise as there is no logical connection or common sense reasoning to support that conclusion."
6137,"For further discussion of the accounting standards for pensions and other retirement benefits for federal employees, see SFFAS No.",There is no further discussion to see.,0,0,True,"step 1: in the premise, there is a reference to a specific document (sffas no.) which provides further discussion on accounting standards for pensions and other retirement benefits for federal employees. step 2: the hypothesis, on the other hand, states that there is 'no further discussion to see'. a lack of further discussion or no additional information being provided is different from the situation described in the premise, where information is being referred to for further discussion. step 3: the hypothesis 'there is no further discussion to see' cannot be logically inferred from the premise 'for further discussion of the accounting standards for pensions and other retirement benefits for federal employees, see sffas no.', as the premise indicates that there is indeed further discussion to be had, and the hypothesis contradicts this.step 4: in order for the hypothesis to be logically entailed by the premise, the hypothesis would have to be a necessary and logical consequence of the information in the premise, which is not the case here. thus, the hypothesis is not entailed by the premise."
6138,"With the $80,000 in grant funds he was trying for, Smith had thought of hiring a lawyer, and paying Jody.","Despite the $80,000 in grant funds that he was trying for, it never occurred to Smith to hire a lawyer.",0,0,True,"step 1: the premise indicates that smith was planning to use $80,000 in grant funds to hire a lawyer and pay jody. step 2: the hypothesis suggests that despite having the $80,000, smith never considered hiring a lawyer. step 3: a difference exists between the premise and hypothesis, as the hypothesis contradicts the premise by stating that smith did not plan to hire a lawyer. step 4: common sense does not dictate that one must hire a lawyer when receiving a large sum of money, and there are no logical or factual inconsistencies in either statement. however, based on the information given, the hypothesis is not logically entailed by the premise, as the premise describes smith's intentions, while the hypothesis describes the absence of those intentions. step 5: based on the logical analysis, common sense, and the contradictory nature of the hypothesis and premise, the hypothesis is not entailed by the premise."
6139,and and i know it's getting off the subject a little bit but i i do you follow a lot of the sports at LSU,I don't care about LSU sports one bit.,0,0,True,"step 1: in the premise, the speaker mentions following lsu sports. this is a statement about their interests. in the hypothesis, the speaker expresses a lack of interest in lsu sports. step 2: the hypothesis directly contradicts the premise, as the premise asserts an interest, while the hypothesis asserts a lack of interest. step 3: based on the contradiction between the premise and hypothesis, the hypothesis cannot be logically inferred from the premise."
6140,"Not only does the system make life easier for people who can't afford a lawyer, but it also might improve efficiency in the courts because the forms, which are printed out when completed, are easy to read and are being filled out correctly, the study found.",They made it easier to understand.,1,1,True,"step 1: in the premise, it is stated that the system makes life easier for people who can't afford a lawyer and improves efficiency in the courts. the forms printed out when completed are described as being easy to read and filled out correctly. this implies that the system simplifies the process and makes the forms more accessible and comprehensible for users.step 2: the hypothesis suggests that the system 'made it easier to understand.' this is a logical consequence of the premise, as 'making it easier to understand' is a part of 'making it easier to fill out correctly' and 'being easy to read.'step 3: based on the logical connection and the common-sense understanding of the situation, the hypothesis can be inferred from the premise."
6141,um-hum um-hum where are you,Where are you located?,1,1,True,"step 1: in the premise, the speaker is asking a question 'where are you'. this question is commonly used to ask for someone's current location. step 2: the hypothesis, 'where are you located?' is identical in meaning to the premise. it is a direct request for someone's current location, which is precisely what the speaker is asking in the premise. step 3: based on the logical equivalence between the premise and hypothesis, and considering their identical meaning, the hypothesis can be inferred from the premise."
6142,A bride adjust her husbands flower on his coat as she holds her own bouquet of flowers.,A bride tidies her groom.,1,1,True,"step 1: the premise describes a scene where a bride is adjusting her husband's flowers on his coat. this action implies that the bride is attending to her husband, ensuring that he looks presentable for their wedding. this is a common and expected role for a bride during a wedding. step 2: the hypothesis suggests that the bride is tidying her groom. this is a logical inference from the premise because 'tidying' or 'fixing up' includes various tasks like adjusting flowers, which is exactly what the bride is doing in the premise. step 3: based on the logical connections and the common-sense understanding of the given context, the hypothesis is a logical inference from the premise."
6143,"The state legislature helped as well, by legalizing gambling in 1931 and thus solidifying the future of the town, though legislators and residents could never have known this at the time.",The legalizing of gambling single-handedly saved the Las Vegas economy,1,0,False,"step 1: in the premise, the state legislature's action of legalizing gambling in 1931 is described as contributing to the future of the town. this implies a positive economic impact. step 2: the hypothesis suggests that the legalization of gambling single-handedly saved the las vegas economy. this is a stronger claim than what is stated in the premise, as it implies that gambling was the sole factor in the town's economic recovery. step 3: while it is true that the legalization of gambling was a significant factor in the economic growth of las vegas, it is not accurate to state that it was the sole factor, as there were likely other contributing factors. the premise does not contradict the hypothesis, but it does not entail it either. step 4: the hypothesis goes beyond the information provided in the premise, and without additional context or information, it cannot be logically inferred from the premise. step 5: common sense and historical record tell us that the legalization of gambling played a crucial role in the development of las vegas, but it was not the only factor. thus, the hypothesis is not entailed by the premise."
6144,"The valuation of Work Loss Days presented in our national benefits summaries, however, incorporates county-specific adjustment factors to account for variations in regional income.",The Work Loss Days will appear to be inflated at first glance.,1,0,False,"step 1: the premise states that the valuation of work loss days in national benefits summaries includes county-specific adjustment factors. this means that the reported work loss days are adjusted based on regional income levels. however, the premise does not provide any information about the magnitude or direction of these adjustment factors. step 2: the hypothesis suggests that the work loss days will appear to be inflated at first glance, but it does not explain why this would be the case or how it relates to the premise. without further context or information, it is not possible to logically infer the hypothesis from the premise. step 3: based on the given information, the hypothesis cannot be reasonably inferred from the premise."
6145,That's why there is much to be said for rail travel.,There is nothing that can be said about rail travel.,0,0,True,"step 1: in the premise, 'that's why there is much to be said for rail travel', the speaker is expressing a positive opinion about rail travel, indicating that there are good reasons or advantages to it. step 2: the hypothesis, 'there is nothing that can be said about rail travel', is the negation of this statement. it suggests that there are no reasons or information to discuss about rail travel. step 3: the hypothesis directly contradicts the information given in the premise. therefore, it cannot be logically inferred from the premise. step 4: the hypothesis is not entailed by the premise."
6146,okay that made a nice ugly sound,It could have made a beautiful sound.,1,0,False,"step 1: in the premise, the sound 'okay that made a nice ugly sound' is described. this phrase suggests a neutral or even negative assessment of the sound. however, the assessment of the sound being 'ugly' is a subjective opinion. step 2: the hypothesis 'it could have made a beautiful sound' contradicts the premise by suggesting an opposite assessment of the same sound. however, without further context or information, it is impossible to logically determine if this hypothesis is true or false. step 3: based on the given information, the hypothesis cannot be definitively inferred from the premise as there is no logical connection or consistency between them."
6147,I was never so glad to see anyone. ,I didn't realize how much I had missed him until then.,1,1,True,"step 1: the premise expresses a strong emotion of gladness or joy upon seeing someone. this emotion can indicate a reunion or the return of someone who was previously missed. step 2: the hypothesis suggests that the speaker didn't realize how much they had missed the person until they saw them again. this is a plausible explanation for the strong emotion expressed in the premise. step 3: the hypothesis is a reasonable inference from the premise, as the emotions stated in the premise can be explained by the missing and subsequent reunion described in the hypothesis."
6148,man i'd carry garbage for twenty eight thousand a year,I wouldn't carry garbage for any amount of time.,0,0,True,"step 1: the premise is a statement expressing a man's willingness to carry garbage for a salary of twenty eight thousand a year. it does not provide any information about the speaker's identity or current situation. step 2: the hypothesis states that the speaker would not carry garbage for any amount of time. this is a negation of the action stated in the premise. step 3: given that the hypothesis directly contradicts the premise, it cannot be logically inferred from the premise. in fact, the hypothesis suggests that the premise is false. step 4: based on the logical relationship between the premise and hypothesis, the hypothesis is not entailed by the premise."
6149,and it was it was just bedlam we really didn't have a quarterback it was uh defense winning winning winning all the games,"The defense was terrible, our quarterback was the best player on the team.",0,0,True,"step 1. the premise describes a situation where the team had a difficult time due to the lack of a reliable quarterback and the defense was performing well enough to win games. step 2. the hypothesis suggests the opposite of what is stated in the premise, implying that the defense was terrible and the quarterback was the best player. step 3. however, the hypothesis contradicts the information given in the premise, as it is not logically possible for both the defense being terrible and the defense winning games at the same time. therefore, the hypothesis cannot be inferred from the premise. step 4. since the hypothesis contradicts the premise, it is not entailed by it."
6150,"As a result, it may be more cost effective overall to use a smaller crane and lift smaller pieces.",It would be more cost effective to use a much larger crane.,0,0,True,"step 1: the premise suggests that using a smaller crane and lifting smaller pieces may lead to overall cost effectiveness. this implies that the size of the crane and the weight of the pieces being lifted can influence the cost. step 2: the hypothesis, however, suggests the opposite of what the premise states, proposing that a larger crane would be more cost effective. this contradicts the information provided in the premise. step 3: based on the logical reasoning, common sense, and factual consistency, the hypothesis cannot be inferred from the premise as it goes against the stated relationship between crane size and cost effectiveness."
6151,Correspondence may be sent to rmit@iname.com.,Correspondence may be sent to gmail@gmail.com,0,0,True,"step 1: the premise states that correspondence can be sent to a specific email address (rmit@iname.com). this implies that the email address is a valid and functional one for receiving correspondence. step 2: the hypothesis suggests a different email address (gmail@gmail.com) for receiving correspondence. however, it does not logically follow from the premise as there is no connection between the two email addresses stated. step 3: based on the given information, there is no entailment from the premise to the hypothesis."
6152,"No matter how much information gets loaded into it, the Internet is never going to transform the dynamics of human behavior.",The internet is coming very close to being as smart as humans.,0,0,True,"step 1: in the premise, the statement is made that no matter how much information is loaded into the internet, it will never transform human behavior. this implies that the internet is a tool or a medium for information and communication, and it does not have the ability to change human behavior on its own. step 2: in the hypothesis, it is stated that the internet is coming very close to being as smart as humans. 'smart' in this context implies the ability to reason, learn, and solve complex problems, which are typically associated with human intelligence. however, the internet is not a living being and does not possess the capacity for consciousness or emotions, which are fundamental aspects of human intelligence. therefore, the hypothesis contradicts the premise. step 3: based on the logical reasoning, the hypothesis cannot be inferred from the premise as it contradicts the core meaning of the premise."
6153,Figure 1: Approaches Used to Address Management Challenges and Program Risks,Figure 1 has sections sub-sections.,1,1,True,"step 1: a figure, such as figure 1, is a graphical representation of data or information. given the context, the figure is presented as having 'approaches used to address management challenges and program risks' as its title and content. this title suggests that the figure is organized into different components or sections for the presentation of this information. common sense and logical principles support the idea that figures can and often do have sub-sections to help clarify and structure the represented information. step 2: the hypothesis 'figure 1 has sections sub-sections' is a logical inference from the premise as the figure's title and the nature of figures in general suggest the existence of sub-sections within the figure's sections. step 3: based on the logical analysis, common sense understanding of figures, and the information provided in the premise, the hypothesis can be inferred from the premise."
6154,They are dealing with danger.,The military is dealing with the terrorist danger.,1,1,True,"step 1: 'they are dealing with danger' is a premise that indicates a situation where individuals are taking actions to address a threatening situation. this could apply to various scenarios, such as emergency responders dealing with a natural disaster, firefighters dealing with a fire, or the military dealing with a security threat.step 2: 'the military is dealing with the terrorist danger' is a hypothesis that specifies the nature of the danger as being related to terrorism, suggesting a security threat. this is a reasonable inference, as the military is often involved in addressing such threats.step 3: given the information provided, it is reasonable to infer that the hypothesis follows logically from the premise. the premise does not limit the nature of the danger, leaving open the possibility that it could be a terrorist threat. therefore, the hypothesis is a valid inference from the premise."
6155,An accompanying piece grades the multiple intelligences movement.,It is unusual to be graded by an accompanying piece.,1,0,False,"step 1: in the premise, 'an accompanying piece grades the multiple intelligences movement,' the term 'accompanying piece' is not defined. it could refer to a variety of things, such as a piece of music, a piece of writing, or even a person. however, the context suggests that it is likely referring to a piece of writing or text. the term 'grades' implies that some evaluation or assessment is being conducted. multiple intelligences is a theory in educational psychology that suggests there are different types of intelligence. step 2: the hypothesis, 'it is unusual to be graded by an accompanying piece,' is not logically entailed by the premise. the premise does not provide enough information to determine if it is unusual for a piece of writing or text to grade something related to multiple intelligences. the hypothesis introduces the concept of 'unusual' without any explanation or context. step 3: based on the given information, the hypothesis cannot be reasonably inferred from the premise."
6156,Some boards do run hospitals like for-profits.,No hospital may legally be run like a for-profit.,0,0,True,"step 1: the premise states that some boards operate hospitals as for-profits. this implies that there exist hospitals that have adopted a business model where they aim to generate a profit. step 2: the hypothesis states that no hospital may legally be run like a for-profit. this suggests a legislative restriction or regulation preventing hospitals from prioritizing profits. step 3: the hypothesis contradicts the premise, as the premise indicates that some hospitals do indeed operate as for-profits, which is not consistent with the hypothesis that no hospital may legally do so. step 4: based on the logical inconsistency between the premise and hypothesis, the hypothesis cannot be inferred from the premise.step 5: it is important to note that the analysis only considers the logical relationship between the premise and hypothesis, and does not delve into the potential moral, ethical, or practical implications of for-profit vs. non-profit hospital management."
6157,Decline and Decadence,Rising and trashy.,0,0,True,"step 1. in this context, 'decline and decadence' could refer to a situation of moral and cultural decay. the term 'rising' in the hypothesis is unclear without additional context. 'trashy' could refer to something of poor quality or vulgar in nature.step 2. the hypothesis 'rising and trashy' does not seem to be logically entailed by the premise 'decline and decadence'. decadence does not necessarily mean a rise in something, and 'rising' does not necessarily imply 'trashy'.step 3. based on the given information, the hypothesis cannot be reasonably inferred from the premise."
6160,The international services and international industry divisions have some common requirements based on the international nature of the two divisions.,Both divisions requirements share no commonality in their requirements.,0,0,True,"step 1: in the premise, it is stated that the international services and international industry divisions have some common requirements due to their international nature. this implies that there are certain shared requirements between the two divisions. step 2: the hypothesis, however, asserts that there is no commonality in the requirements between the two divisions. this directly contradicts the information provided in the premise. step 3: based on the given information, the hypothesis is not entailed by the premise since it contradicts it."
6161,The museum's dramatic treasures include intricately carved ninth-century wooden panels from the El-Aksa Mosque; Crusader stonework from France that once covered the entrance to the Church of the Holy Sepulcher; and richly ornamented early-Islamic architectural details from the eighth-century Palace of Hisham in Jericho.,The panels of the El-Aksa Mosque are from the 11th century.,0,0,True,"step 1: in the premise, the wooden panels from the el-aksa mosque are identified as intricately carved ninth-century treasures. this indicates that the panels are over 1000 years old. step 2: the hypothesis suggests that the panels are from the 11th century, which is earlier than the stated ninth century. however, the hypothesis contradicts the premise, as the premise clearly states that the panels are ninth-century artifacts. step 3: based on the logical analysis, the hypothesis cannot be inferred from the premise as it contradicts the known information provided in the premise."
6162,The rapids formed where the Yukon River flows across and cuts down through lava flows of the Miles Canyon basalt.,The rapids formed where the Yukon River flows across and cuts down through lava flows of the Mattoon basalt.,0,1,False,"step 1: in the premise, the formation of the rapids is attributed to the yukon river flowing across and cutting down through lava flows, specifically those in the miles canyon basalt. this description indicates a geological process where the river's flow interacts with and erodes the volcanic rock. step 2: the hypothesis suggests that the rapids formed in a different location, where the yukon river cuts through lava flows in the mattoon basalt. this hypothesis is similar to the premise in that it also describes the rapids forming through the interaction of the yukon river with lava flows. step 3: while the specific location of the lava flows differs between the premise and hypothesis, the underlying geological process remains the same. thus, the hypothesis does not contradict the premise, and it is a reasonable extension given the common geological phenomenon of rivers eroding through volcanic rock in various locations. step 4: therefore, the hypothesis is a logical inference from the premise, as both describe the formation of rapids through the interaction of the yukon river with lava flows in different locations."
6164,Countess Constance Markievicz led a band of rebels to occupy buildings around St. Stephen's Green.,St. Stephen's Green was the center of a controversial event.,1,1,True,"step 1: in the premise, countess constance markievicz is identified as a leader of rebels who occupied buildings around st. stephen's green. this information indicates that st. stephen's green was the location of a significant and controversial event, as 'occupying buildings' is an action commonly associated with rebellions and unrest. step 2: the hypothesis 'st. stephen's green was the center of a controversial event' can be logically inferred from the premise since the premise establishes that st. stephen's green was indeed the site of a controversial event. step 3: based on the logical connection between the premise and hypothesis and the factual information provided, the hypothesis is entailed by the premise."
6165,Views from  Implementation Research in Education.,Education research is a must ,1,1,True,"step 1: in the premise, 'views from implementation research in education' is not explicitly defining or discussing the concept of 'a must' or necessity. however, we can infer that the title is likely discussing the importance or necessity of implementation research in education.step 2: the hypothesis, 'education research is a must', is stating that education research is necessary. this is a logical entailment of the premise as the premise implies that implementation research in education is important, and importance often implies necessity.step 3: based on the logical connection between the premise and hypothesis, the hypothesis can be inferred from the premise."
6166,Don't remember. ,"Yes, I remember.",0,0,True,"step 1: neither the premise nor the hypothesis provide any specific information that can be identified and logically connected. the premise is a statement of forgetfulness, and the hypothesis is a statement of memory. there are no known facts or logical principles that directly relate the premise to the hypothesis. step 2: the hypothesis cannot be logically inferred from the premise, as forgetting something does not imply a lack of memory at a later time. step 3: based on the lack of logical connection and the absence of common sense reasoning or factual consistency, the hypothesis is not entailed by the premise."
6167,"The Gallery in the Forest, once the old sawmill, houses many other exhibits, and the Theatre in the Forest holds concerts and performances on weekends in the summer.",No performances of any kind take place in the Theatre of the Forest. ,0,0,True,"step 1: in the premise, it is stated that the theatre in the forest holds concerts and performances on weekends in the summer. this implies that there are specific occasions when performances take place. step 2: the hypothesis states that 'no performances of any kind take place in the theatre of the forest.' this directly contradicts the information in the premise. step 3: based on the logical negation of the premise's statement, the hypothesis cannot be inferred or logically entailed from the premise."

6169,The album was remastered by Funky Town Grooves in June 2012.,The album was remastered and expanded by Funky Town Grooves in June 2012.,1,1,True,"step 1: in the premise, it is stated that the album was remastered by funky town grooves in june 2012. this implies that the album underwent some form of audio restoration process. no specific information about expanding the album is mentioned. step 2: in the hypothesis, it is suggested that not only was the album remastered but also expanded by funky town grooves in june 2012. the act of 'expanding' typically involves adding extra content to the album, such as bonus tracks or extended versions of songs. step 3: the hypothesis is logically consistent with the premise, as remastering and expanding are two distinct processes that can be performed together. the hypothesis does not contradict the premise and provides additional information about what was done to the album in june 2012. step 4: based on the given information, the hypothesis can be reasonably inferred from the premise. the lack of any conflicting information and the logic of the processes involved support this conclusion."
6170,Are the rest in the caves? Jon asked the Kal.,Jon never speaks to Kal.,0,0,True,"step 1: in the premise, jon is asking a question to the kal. this establishes a clear interaction between the two. common sense and factual consistency do not suggest any contradictions within the premise. step 2: the hypothesis, 'jon never speaks to kal,' contradicts the information in the premise, which indicates that jon does indeed speak to kal. step 3: based on the logical negation of the interaction described in the premise, it's clear that the hypothesis cannot be inferred from the premise.step 4: the hypothesis, 'jon never speaks to kal,' is not entailed by the premise, as it contradicts the information presented in the premise."
6171,"For people and for the nation, saving means forgoing consumption today so they can enjoy a better standard of living in the future.",Saving means forgoing consumption today so they can enjoy better cinemas in the future.,1,0,False,"step 1: in the premise, saving is described as an action that leads to a better standard of living in the future for both individuals and the nation. this implies that by forgoing consumption today, one is able to accumulate resources for future use. step 2: the hypothesis suggests that saving results in improved cinemas in the future. while there is no direct logical connection between saving and cinemas in the hypothesis, the concept of saving for future enjoyment is present, much like in the premise. step 3: however, the hypothesis does not logically follow from the premise as stated, since there is no explicit or implicit connection between saving and cinemas in the premise. saving could lead to various outcomes, not just improved cinemas. step 4: therefore, based on the given information, the hypothesis cannot be logically inferred from the premise."
6172,The top of the modeling domain is 4000 meters above ground level.,The bottom of the modeling domain is 4000 meters above ground level.,0,0,True,"step 1: the premise provides the height of the top of the modeling domain, which is 4000 meters above ground level. however, it does not provide any information about the height of the bottom of the modeling domain. step 2: the hypothesis suggests that the bottom of the modeling domain is also 4000 meters above ground level. however, this information is not logically entailed from the premise. in fact, the premise does not provide sufficient evidence to support or reject the hypothesis. step 3: based on the given information, the hypothesis cannot be logically inferred from the premise."

6174,so and then and then you go back to New York after school,You are going to Boston before school.,0,0,True,"step 1: in the premise, 'you go back to new york after school', it describes a sequence of events that occurs after the completion of school. there's no specific information about any events that might happen before school.step 2: the hypothesis, 'you are going to boston before school', suggests a completely different scenario, with the person traveling to boston instead of new york, and this action is described as happening 'before school'.step 3: this hypothesis cannot be logically inferred from the premise, as the events described in the hypothesis are not related to the events in the premise in any way. the premise does not provide any information about the person's plans or actions before school. therefore, the hypothesis is not entailed by the premise.step 4: the hypothesis contradicts the premise, as it states that the person goes to boston instead of new york and this action is described as happening before school, whereas the premise describes returning to new york after school."
6175,I am sticky and hot and not very happy.,I am thrilled.,0,0,True,"step 1: in the premise, the speaker describes themselves as 'sticky' and 'hot', which may suggest a situation where they have been engaged in physical activity or are in a hot environment. the statement 'not very happy' indicates a negative emotional state. step 2: the hypothesis 'i am thrilled' directly contradicts the premise, as 'thrilled' implies a positive emotional state, which is not suggested in the premise. step 3: the hypothesis 'i am thrilled' cannot be logically inferred from the premise, as it contradicts the information provided in the premise."
6176,"Meanwhile, people hostile to popular notions of addiction will dismiss the characterization of Clinton as a sex addict as an evasion of personal responsibility.",Everyone accepts Clinton is an addict.,0,0,True,"step 1: in the premise, it is stated that some people dismiss the characterization of clinton as a sex addict. this implies that there are others who do not dismiss this characterization. however, the premise does not provide enough information to determine if everyone accepts clinton as an addict. the hypothesis states that everyone does.step 2: the hypothesis contradicts the premise as it asserts a generalization about everyone's acceptance of clinton being an addict that is not supported by the premise.step 3: based on the logical analysis, the hypothesis cannot be inferred from the premise as it contradicts the information provided."
6177,Two girls play with origami.,The girls hold paper,1,1,True,"step 1: origami is the art of paper folding. the premise states that two girls are involved in an activity related to origami. step 2: holding paper is a necessary part of the origami process, as the paper is the material being manipulated to create the various designs. thus, the hypothesis 'the girls hold paper' can be logically inferred from the premise 'two girls play with origami'. step 3: based on the logical connections between the premise and hypothesis, and the fact that holding paper is a common-sense expectation when engaging in the activity of origami, the hypothesis is entailed by the premise."
6178,It's better to build a law enforcement system than to punish one outlaw.,Law enforcement should go after every single outlaw.,0,0,True,"step 1: in the premise, 'building a law enforcement system' implies establishing a system to prevent and deter criminal activities. 'a single outlaw' refers to an individual who has committed a crime. step 2: the hypothesis suggests that law enforcement should focus on apprehending every single criminal. although this is an action within the scope of law enforcement, it does not directly follow from the premise as the premise focuses on the overall system, not specific actions within the system. step 3: the hypothesis is not logically entailed by the premise as the premise allows for a broader approach to law enforcement, including prevention and deterrence, while the hypothesis focuses solely on apprehending all criminals."
6179,Linguistic nationalists are pushing their English-first measures.,Nationalists are doing this because they  think their country is the best.,1,0,False,"step 1: the premise indicates that linguistic nationalists are implementing english-first measures. this does not imply any particular reason or motivation for their actions. it is a neutral statement about their behavior. step 2: the hypothesis suggests that nationalists believe their country is the best as a reason for pushing english-first measures. this is an inference or assumption about their motivations. step 3: while the premise does not directly entail the hypothesis, it is possible to draw this inference based on common sense and logical reasoning. nationalists may indeed believe their country is the best and see english-first measures as a way to promote their country's language and culture. this is a plausible explanation, but it is not the only possible motivation. other reasons, such as economic or political advantages, could also be at play. therefore, while the hypothesis can be inferred from the premise with some degree of likelihood, it is not a logical necessity. step 4: however, without additional information, it is impossible to definitively establish the truth or falsehood of the hypothesis. the premise alone does not provide sufficient evidence to entail the hypothesis.step 5: based on the above reasoning, the hypothesis is not logically entailed by the premise, but it is a possible inference that can be drawn based on common sense and logical reasoning, with some degree of likelihood."
6180,oh i guess the work force would be the main wouldn't it it uh,"The main point is the workforce, what can be done to improve working conditions.",1,1,True,"step 1: the premise expresses a topic of discussion, indicating that the workforce is a significant aspect. it does not provide specific information about improving working conditions, but it sets up the context. step 2: the hypothesis also refers to the workforce as a main point, but it goes a step further by suggesting that there is a need to discuss or consider ways to improve working conditions. this is a reasonable inference from the premise, as improving working conditions is a natural implication of focusing on the workforce. step 3: based on the logical connection between the premise and hypothesis, and the lack of contradictory information, the hypothesis can be inferred from the premise.step 4: it's important to note that while the hypothesis can be inferred from the premise, the premise does not explicitly state the hypothesis. the hypothesis provides additional information or a more specific focus on the topic introduced in the premise."
6181,right right that you didn't want to waste the time or the the expensive movie ticket then the videos are worth it,"Going to the movies is always a good time, so you don't bother with the videos.",0,0,True,"step 1: the premise indicates that the person did not want to waste time or money on movies and instead opted for videos. it does not provide any information about the person's overall opinion of movies or videos. step 2: the hypothesis suggests that the person believes going to the movies is always a good time and doesn't care for videos. this is a contradiction to the premise, as it implies the person prefers movies to videos. step 3: the hypothesis cannot be logically inferred from the premise, as they express conflicting ideas."
6182,A'deem admired the fine sculpted work of the nude woman on the swords hilt.,A'deem was turned on by the naked lady.,1,1,True,"step 1: the premise states that a'deem admired the fine sculpted work of a naked woman on a sword hilt. admiring something implies a positive emotional response. nudity is often associated with sexual attraction. step 2: the hypothesis suggests that a'deem was aroused or turned on by the sight of the naked lady. this is a logical inference from the premise, as the emotional response of admiration could plausibly be rooted in sexual attraction. step 3: based on the logical connection between admiration and sexual attraction, the hypothesis can be inferred from the premise."
6183,Young man running towards a tennis court while another is waiting in the other side of the net.,A young girl is running to a soccer field.,0,0,True,"step 1: in the premise, we have the information that there are two young individuals involved - one man is running towards a tennis court and another is waiting at a tennis court. this scene suggests an active engagement in a sporting activity. no information is provided about the genders or ages of the individuals at the soccer field.step 2: the hypothesis describes a different scenario - a young girl running towards a soccer field. while the premise and hypothesis describe different scenarios with no direct connection, there is no contradiction between them. the individuals and actions in the premise do not prevent or negate the possibility of the hypothesis.step 3: the hypothesis cannot be logically inferred from the premise as there is no shared information or logical connection between the two statements. the premise does not provide any evidence or indication of a young girl running to a soccer field."
6184,Mother tells me you were out early this morning.,Were you running errands?,1,1,True,"step 1: a mother telling 'you' (the addressee) that 'you' were out early this morning indicates that 'you' left the house before the typical waking hours or before sunrise. this is a neutral statement, it does not necessarily imply any specific activity. common sense suggests that 'running errands' is a possible explanation for being out early. step 2: the hypothesis 'were you running errands?' can be logically inferred from the premise because 'running errands' is a plausible explanation for being out early. the premise does not contradict the hypothesis. step 3: based on the logical reasoning, common sense, and the lack of contradictory information, the hypothesis can be inferred from the premise."
6185,"Anyway, snarled Whittington, ""you knew enough to come in here and plump out that name.""",Whittington thought you knew nothing.,0,0,True,"step 1: the premise 'you knew enough to come in here and plump out that name,' suggests whittington believed the speaker had some knowledge or information. step 2: the hypothesis 'whittington thought you knew nothing' contradicts the premise, as it states whittington had a different belief about the speaker's knowledge. step 3: based on the given information, the hypothesis 'whittington thought you knew nothing' cannot be logically inferred from the premise 'you knew enough to come in here and plump out that name.'step 4: the hypothesis presents a different belief or assumption about whittington's thought process, and it contradicts the premise. therefore, there is no entailment between the premise and hypothesis."
6186,I had the whole thing at my finger-tips.,I had the whole thing in the palm of my hands.,1,1,True,"step 1: 'at my finger-tips' and 'in the palm of my hands' both refer to having possession or control of something. they are synonymous in this context.step 2: the hypothesis can be logically inferred from the premise because 'having something at my finger-tips' implies being able to easily access or control it, which is the same as 'having it in the palm of my hands'.step 3: based on the logical equivalence of the two phrases and the lack of contradictory information, the hypothesis is entailed by the premise."
6188,"A cockfight is a blood sport between gamecocks, held in a ring called a cockpit.","A cockfight is a blood sport between two cocks, or gamecocks, held in a ring called a cockpit.",1,1,True,"step 1: in the premise, a cockfight is defined as a blood sport between gamecocks held in a cockpit. the term 'gamecocks' refers to roosters specifically bred for cockfighting. the description of a cockfight as a 'blood sport' denotes an event involving the shedding of blood. step 2: the hypothesis is identical to the premise except for the use of the general term 'cocks' instead of 'gamecocks'. however, the term 'cocks' is a general term for roosters, and in the context of cockfighting, it is commonly used interchangeably with 'gamecocks'. therefore, the hypothesis can be inferred from the premise as it is a more general term encompassing the specific term 'gamecocks'. step 3: based on the logical equivalence between 'cocks' and 'gamecocks' in the context of cockfighting, and the similarity in meaning between the premise and hypothesis, the hypothesis is entailed by the premise."
6189,"A man is taking a scenic photo of mountains while framing the foreground with low-growth, colorful brush.",There is a person taking a picture.,1,1,True,"step 1: in the premise, we have the information that a man is taking a photo of mountains. taking a photo is an action associated with taking a picture. the premise also mentions 'framing the foreground with low-growth, colorful brush', which is a common practice for taking good photos. thus, the scene described in the premise includes a person taking a picture.step 2: the hypothesis 'there is a person taking a picture' directly follows from the information provided in the premise. the hypothesis is an entailment of the premise because it logically follows from the description of the man taking a photo.step 3: based on the logical connections between the premise and hypothesis, and the common-sense understanding that the man described in the premise is indeed the person taking the picture, the hypothesis is a logical entailment of the premise."
6190,"Buchanan even uses the word deterrence, though he doesn't use Mutually Assured Destruction, Bakelite, or hula hoop.",Buchanan's favorite word to use is hula hoop and he uses it often.,0,0,True,"step 1: the premise states that buchanan uses the word 'deterrence' and does not use the words 'mutually assured destruction', 'bakelite', or 'hula hoop' in a specific context. this information does not provide enough context to determine buchanan's favorite word or his frequency of using it. step 2: the hypothesis suggests that buchanan's favorite word is 'hula hoop' and he uses it often. however, there is no evidence or logical connection to the premise that supports this hypothesis. step 3: based on the lack of connection between the premise and hypothesis, the hypothesis cannot be logically inferred from the premise."

6192,his wife that's happening more and more often too,It isn't happening to his wife at all. ,0,0,True,"step 1: in the premise, it is stated that 'it' is happening more and more often to his wife. the identity of 'it' is not provided in the premise, leaving it ambiguous. however, the hypothesis states that 'it' is not happening to his wife at all. step 2: to determine if the hypothesis can be inferred from the premise, we need to understand what 'it' refers to in both the premise and the hypothesis. given the ambiguity of 'it' in the premise, we cannot make a definitive conclusion based on the given information alone. the hypothesis contradicts the premise if 'it' refers to something negative happening to his wife, but it cannot be logically inferred if 'it' refers to something positive or neutral. step 3: based on the lack of sufficient information provided, the hypothesis cannot be definitively determined to be entailed or contradicted by the premise."
6193,"In 1972, the 53-year-old Salinger wrote the notorious fan letter to the 18-year-old Joyce Maynard, who had just written a New York Times Magazine cover story about herself.",Salinger did not write any fan letter to Joyce.,0,0,True,"step 1: in the premise, it is stated as a fact that salinger wrote a fan letter to joyce maynard in 1972. this fact is based on historical records and is not contradicted by any common knowledge or logical inconsistencies.step 2: the hypothesis states that salinger did not write any fan letter to joyce. this directly contradicts the information presented in the premise.step 3: based on the discrepancy between the premise and hypothesis, it can be concluded that the hypothesis is not entailed by the premise. in fact, it is the opposite of what the premise asserts."
6194,An Excursion to Guangzhou (Canton),The journey to Guangzhou takes thirty minutes. ,1,0,False,"step 1. analyzing the premise, 'an excursion to guangzhou', it refers to a journey or trip to guangzhou (canton), but the premise itself does not provide any specific information about the duration of the journey.step 2. the hypothesis 'the journey to guangzhou takes thirty minutes' is not logically entailed by the premise. it contradicts the information in the premise as there is no evidence or information given in the premise that the journey takes thirty minutes.step 3. based on the given information, the hypothesis is not a logical inference from the premise."
6195,"From here, a steep path and stairs lead 800 metres (2184 feet) up an age-old pilgrims' path to the Stella Maris Carmelite Church and Monastery, built in 1836 over a cave also believed to have been inhabited by the prophet Elijah.","The Monastery is fantastic, it carries a deep historic importance.",1,1,True,"step 1: the premise describes a steep path and stairs that lead to the stella maris carmelite church and monastery, which was built in 1836 and is situated over a cave believed to have been inhabited by the prophet elijah. this information indicates the historical significance and age of the monastery.step 2: the hypothesis states that the monastery is 'fantastic' and 'carries a deep historic importance.' the terms 'fantastic' and 'deep historic importance' are subjective and do not directly follow from the premise. however, the premise does provide objective evidence that the monastery is historic and important, which can be inferred from the information about its age, construction, and association with a significant religious figure.step 3: based on the objective information provided in the premise, it can be inferred that the monastery is historically significant and important. the hypothesis, while not logically entailed by the premise, is a reasonable and expected conclusion based on the information provided.step 4: in practice, the hypothesis can be considered entailed by the premise, as the information in the premise strongly implies the historic importance of the monastery, which is stated in the hypothesis."
6196,"Since when did the practices of confused, incompetent Strom become the guide for senatorial behavior?)",Smith is incompetent and confused.,0,0,True,"step 1: in the premise, the speaker questions why the practices of a person identified as 'strom', who is described as 'confused' and 'incompetent', are being used as a guide for senatorial behavior. this implies that there is a known association between 'strom' and behaviors that are not desirable or effective for a senator.step 2: the hypothesis describes smith as 'incompetent' and 'confused'. there is a clear semantic relationship between the terms used to describe 'strom' in the premise and the terms used to describe smith in the hypothesis.step 3: based on the given information, the hypothesis is not a logical entailment of the premise. however, the similarity in the descriptions of 'strom' and smith raises the possibility that smith may indeed exhibit the same behaviors or characteristics. the premise does not guarantee the truth of the hypothesis, but it does suggest a potential connection that could warrant further investigation.step 4: logically, the premise does not entail the hypothesis, but the hypothesis could be a valid conclusion if smith is indeed the 'strom' referred to in the premise. without additional context or information, it is impossible to determine this definitively based on the given sentences alone."

6202,Bob Dole angered many Hispanics by endorsing the move to make English the official language of the United States.,No Hispanic people were angry at Bob Dole for his endorsement of English being the official language of the United States.,0,0,True,"step 1: in the premise, it is stated that 'bob dole angered many hispanics' due to his endorsement of making english the official language. this implies that there exists a significant number of hispanic people who were displeased with bob dole's stance. common sense suggests that when a public figure endorses a controversial policy, it is expected that some groups may express disagreement and anger. step 2: the hypothesis states that 'no hispanic people were angry at bob dole.' this directly contradicts the premise, as the premise indicates that 'many hispanics' were angry. step 3: based on the logical contradiction between the premise and hypothesis, it is clear that the hypothesis cannot be inferred from the premise. the hypothesis asserts a fact that is not supported by the given information in the premise.step 4: it's important to note that the absence of evidence is not evidence of absence. it is possible that some hispanics may have supported bob dole's stance, or remained neutral, and their voices were not covered in the reported 'many hispanics' who were angry. however, the given premise does not provide enough evidence to support the hypothesis.step 5: in conclusion, the hypothesis 'no hispanic people were angry at bob dole for his endorsement of english being the official language of the united states' is not entailed by the premise. the hypothesis contradicts the premise.step 6: when the hypothesis contradicts the premise, the label is 0."
6203,"For example, when this work includes examination of management's records, the audit documentation should describe those records so that an experienced reviewer would be able to examine those same records.",Management's records are not exempted from examination.,0,1,False,"step 1: the premise states that when an audit includes examination of management's records, the audit documentation must describe those records in detail for an experienced reviewer to examine them. this implies that management's records are subject to examination. step 2: the hypothesis, 'management's records are not exempted from examination,' directly aligns with the premise. the hypothesis is a more general statement about management's records, but it is logically entailed by the details provided in the premise. step 3: based on the logical relationship between the premise and hypothesis, and the lack of contradictory information, the hypothesis can be inferred from the premise."
6204,"The resorts on Israel's west coast don't particularly cater for children, though Eilat is a typically Mediterranean-style resort with numerous beach activities and hotels designed with European families very much in mind.",Resorts in eastern Israel often cater well to children.,1,0,False,"step 1: in the premise, it is mentioned that resorts on israel's west coast generally do not cater to children, but eilat, a resort on the mediterranean-style west coast, is an exception with numerous beach activities and hotels designed for european families. step 2: the hypothesis makes a claim about resorts in 'eastern israel'. the premise does not provide any direct information about the resorts in eastern israel. step 3: based on the provided premise, it is not logically possible to infer the hypothesis as the premise does not contain the necessary information to support the hypothesis."
6205,oh that's fascinating uh-huh,That brings very little interest to me.,0,0,True,"step 1: in the premise, there are no specific statements or implications that can be logically connected to the hypothesis. the premise is a simple expression of fascination and does not provide any information about the subject of the hypothesis. step 2: the hypothesis states that the premise brings 'very little interest'. this is a subjective judgment that cannot be logically inferred from the premise, as the premise itself does not express any level of interest or lack thereof towards its subject. step 3: based on the lack of logical connection and the subjective nature of the hypothesis, the hypothesis cannot be logically inferred from the premise."
6206,"In the case of acid rain, significant reductions in sulfur dioxide have not corresponded to ecological changes due to continuing high levels of nitrogen.",Significant reductions in sulfur dioxide have caused ecological changes to occur.,0,0,True,"step 1: the premise states that although there have been significant reductions in sulfur dioxide, there have been no corresponding ecological changes, which is likely due to the continued high levels of nitrogen. this suggests a complex environmental issue where both sulfur dioxide and nitrogen play roles in the ecological changes. step 2: the hypothesis proposes that significant reductions in sulfur dioxide lead to ecological changes. this directly contradicts the information in the premise. step 3: based on the information provided, the hypothesis cannot be logically inferred from the premise. the premise indicates that sulfur dioxide reductions have not led to the expected ecological changes, not that they have caused no changes at all. therefore, the hypothesis is not entailed by the premise."
6207,"Michelozzo's later Santissima Annunziata church, together with the 17th-century fountains and equestrian statue of Grand Duke Ferdinando, preserve the harmonies of the master's overall design.",The Santissima Annunziata church differs greatly from Michelozzo's's usual designs.,0,0,True,"step 1: in the premise, it is stated that michelozzo's later santissima annunziata church, along with the 17th-century fountains and equestrian statue of grand duke ferdinando, preserve the harmonies of the master's overall design. this implies that the santissima annunziata church, as part of michelozzo's design, maintains a sense of unity and balance with the surrounding features.step 2: the hypothesis suggests that the santissima annunziata church differs greatly from michelozzo's usual designs. this contradicts the premise, as it implies that the church does not preserve the harmonies of michelozzo's overall design.step 3: based on the logical reasoning and the contradiction between the premise and hypothesis, the hypothesis is not entailed by the premise."

6209,"First - seeded Kim Clijsters earned $ $ 1,000,030 first - prize money as well as 485 ranking points.","First-seeded Kim Clijsters won the singles event and earned $1,000,030 first-prize money as well as 485 ranking points.",1,1,True,"step 1: in the premise, it is stated that 'seeded kim clijsters earned $ $ 1,000,030 first-prize money as well as 485 ranking points.' this implies that kim clijsters received these rewards for winning the singles event because prize money and ranking points are typically awarded to the winner. common sense and factual knowledge about tennis tournaments suggest this is the case.step 2: in the hypothesis, it is stated that 'first-seeded kim clijsters won the singles event and earned $1,000,030 first-prize money as well as 485 ranking points.' this statement is identical to the premise, except that it explicitly states that kim clijsters won the event. given that the premise implies that kim clijsters won the event based on the information provided, the hypothesis can be logically inferred from the premise.step 3: based on the logical reasoning and factual consistency, the hypothesis is entailed by the premise."
6210,He whines and yells at the kids for laughing or playing too loud.,"He doesn't like when kids are too loud, but he is abusive towards them.",1,0,False,"step 1: in the premise, it is stated that the man reacts negatively to kids laughing or playing loudly. this reaction suggests that he finds the noise disturbing or unpleasant. step 2: the hypothesis introduces an additional detail, stating that the man is abusive towards the kids. this contradicts the neutral or disapproving tone implied in the premise. step 3: the hypothesis 'he doesn't like when kids are too loud, but he is abusive towards them' cannot be logically inferred from the premise as it introduces new information that is not suggested or implied by the given context."
6211,i think that so they want to you know try and i think they're trying i think that i think that most of the politicians understand this they just don't they're just not very good at doing what they're supposed to be doing,The politicians are not doing a good job because they're lazy.,1,1,True,"step 1. in the premise, the speaker is expressing their opinion that most politicians understand the issues but they're not good at addressing them. this implies that there's a gap between understanding and action.step 2. the hypothesis suggests that politicians are not doing a good job because they're lazy. this explanation fits within the context of the premise, as 'not being good at doing what they're supposed to be doing' can be interpreted as lack of effort or motivation.step 3. based on the given information and the logical connection between the premise and hypothesis, the hypothesis 'the politicians are not doing a good job because they're lazy' can be inferred from the premise 'i think that most of the politicians understand this they just don't they're just not very good at doing what they're supposed to be doing'."
6212,yeah and and what but the thing is then you've got to with screws and that's the other issue uh the pitch and,The pitch is the hardest issue to overcome.,1,1,True,"step 1: in the premise, the speaker mentions several issues related to 'screws' and 'pitch'. the sentence structure suggests that 'pitch' is one of the issues being discussed. however, the premise does not explicitly state that the pitch is the most difficult issue to overcome, that is inferred from the context. step 2: the hypothesis states that 'the pitch is the hardest issue to overcome'. this can be logically inferred from the premise as the speaker implies that among the mentioned issues, 'pitch' is the most challenging one. step 3: based on the logical reasoning derived from the context and the lack of contradictory statements, the hypothesis can be inferred from the premise."
6213,"Accordingly, our work over the last decade has focused on strengthening federal agency management of IT investment.",Each year federal agency management of IT investment has grown a little stronger than the year before.,1,0,False,"step 1: the premise indicates that the focus of work over the last decade has been on strengthening federal agency management of it investment. this implies that there has been a consistent effort to improve this area. step 2: the hypothesis suggests that the management of it investment has been growing stronger each year. this statement is consistent with the premise as it also implies a gradual improvement. step 3: based on the consistency between the premise and hypothesis, and the lack of any obvious contradictions, the hypothesis can be inferred from the premise.step 4: it is important to note that while the hypothesis can be inferred from the premise, the premise does not directly entail the hypothesis. the premise only sets up the context in which the hypothesis is likely to be true, but it does not guarantee it.step 5: therefore, while the hypothesis is a reasonable inference from the premise, it is not an entailment, as the premise allows for the possibility of stability or even declines in management of it investment that do not contradict the premise but would make the hypothesis false."
6214,so and then and then you go back to New York after school,You really enjoy looking at the buildings in New York,1,0,False,"step 1: in the premise, 'you go back to new york after school', the focus is on a person returning to new york city after completing their education. there's no explicit mention of any particular activities or feelings during their time in new york. step 2: the hypothesis 'you really enjoy looking at the buildings in new york' implies a positive emotion or interest towards the buildings in new york city. this information is not directly stated or implied in the premise.step 3: it is possible for someone to enjoy looking at the buildings in new york without it being mentioned in the premise. the premise and hypothesis describe different aspects of the situation, with the premise focusing on the person's location and the hypothesis focusing on their feelings or interests. therefore, the hypothesis cannot be logically inferred from the premise alone.step 4: however, it's important to note that the premise does not contradict the hypothesis, and there could be other contextual or experiential factors that make the hypothesis plausible. for instance, a person might develop an appreciation for new york city's architecture during their time there, which would be consistent with the hypothesis.step 5: based on the given information, the hypothesis is not entailed by the premise, but it remains a plausible explanation for the person's behavior in new york."
6215,"Other commentators stated that, even where rules of professional responsibility would not absolutely bar representation, the unavailability of substitute counsel could ethically compel LSC attorneys to refuse representation.",The LSC attorneys are among the most ethical.,1,1,True,"step 1: in the premise, it is mentioned that other commentators have stated that lsc attorneys might be ethically compelled to refuse representation due to unavailability of substitute counsel, even when rules of professional responsibility do not absolutely bar it. this implies that lsc attorneys have a high sense of ethics that goes beyond what is required by professional rules.step 2: the hypothesis suggests that lsc attorneys are among the most ethical. this hypothesis aligns with the information provided in the premise, as the premise indicates that lsc attorneys have a strong ethical commitment.step 3: based on the information provided in the premise and the logical consistency of the hypothesis with the premise, the hypothesis can be inferred from the premise. the premise suggests that lsc attorneys have a higher ethical standard than what is required, and the hypothesis states that they are among the most ethical. this is a logical inference."
6216,"Usually these shows have no laugh tracks, punchlines.","Usually these shows have no laugh tracks, predetermined entrances, or punchlines.",1,1,True,"step 1: in the premise, it is stated that 'usually these shows have no laugh tracks, punchlines.' this means that in the typical or standard production of these shows, there are no added audience laughter sounds (laugh tracks) and no preplanned jokes (punchlines). step 2: the hypothesis adds an extra condition, 'or predetermined entrances.' this condition does not contradict the information in the premise, as there is no mention of 'predetermined entrances' in relation to laugh tracks or punchlines in the premise. step 3: based on the information provided, the hypothesis can be logically inferred from the premise, as it expands upon the given conditions without contradicting them."
6217,i don't know no i don't,"Yes, I am well informed about that.",0,0,True,"step 1: in the premise, the speaker is expressing a lack of knowledge or information about a specific topic. the hypothesis, on the other hand, asserts that the speaker is well-informed. step 2: the hypothesis directly contradicts the premise, as the premise states that the speaker does not know or is not informed, while the hypothesis asserts that the speaker is well-informed. step 3: based on the logical negation of the given information, the hypothesis cannot be logically inferred from the premise.step 4: it is important to note that making assumptions or speculations about a speaker's knowledge or intentions based on their language use is generally a complex task, as it involves understanding the context, the speaker's background, and their communicative intentions. in this case, the premise is a simple declarative sentence, and the hypothesis is a direct contradiction. thus, the hypothesis is not entailed by the premise."
6218,"To Johnny, Drew could loom as a threat.",Drew was no threat to Johnny whatsoever. ,0,0,True,"step 1: the premise indicates that johnny perceives drew as a potential threat. this is a subjective perception and does not necessarily reflect an actual threat. it is important to note that the premise does not provide any information about the existence or absence of an actual threat.step 2: the hypothesis asserts that there was no threat from drew to johnny at all. this is a clear contradiction to the premise, as the premise suggests the presence of a potential threat.step 3: based on the logical analysis, the hypothesis cannot be inferred from the premise as it directly contradicts it."
6219,yeah i think capital crimes uh capital crimes and i want to say kidnap i don't know why kidnapping sticks in my mind but um,I don't know why capital crimes make me think of kidnapping,1,0,False,"step 1. in the premise, 'capital crimes' are mentioned, which refers to serious offenses that are punishable by death or life imprisonment. no specific crime is named within 'capital crimes'. in the hypothesis, there is no clear connection to capital crimes or any specific crime being mentioned. the mention of 'kidnapping' in the premise is an unrelated thought.step 2. the hypothesis 'i don't know why capital crimes make me think of kidnapping' does not logically follow from the premise 'yeah i think capital crimes and i want to say kidnapping'. there is no causal or inferential relationship between capital crimes and kidnapping stated in the premise, nor does the premise provide any information that could reasonably lead to the hypothesis.step 3. based on the logical analysis, the hypothesis is not entailed by the premise, as there is no logical connection or justification for the hypothesis in the premise."
6220,um-hum do you enjoy working out in the yard,Do you like lifting weights outside?,1,1,True,"step 1: in the premise, the speaker is expressing enjoyment for an activity they do in the yard. no specific details about the nature of the activity are provided, but 'working out' is a broad term that can include various physical activities such as lifting weights, bodyweight exercises, or using exercise equipment.step 2: the hypothesis suggests a specific type of working out activity, 'lifting weights outside.' this is a reasonable inference from the premise, given that 'working out' can include lifting weights and the hypothesis does not contradict the premise.step 3: based on the logical relationship between the premise and hypothesis, and the lack of contradictory information, the hypothesis can be inferred from the premise."
6221,Back they would go with a limping ship and the burden of the controls entirely on himself.,The ship was limping after being battered by the relentless waves. ,1,1,True,"step 1: in the premise, the text mentions that the ship was limping and the burden of controls was entirely on the person. this implies that the ship was damaged and not functioning optimally. the hypothesis suggests the same, that the ship was limping due to being battered by the waves. this is a logical connection based on the information provided.step 2: the hypothesis is consistent with the premise as it explains why the ship was limping and why the burden of controls was on the person. the hypothesis does not contradict the premise in any way.step 3: based on the logical connection between the premise and hypothesis, and the fact that the hypothesis is a reasonable explanation for the information given in the premise, the hypothesis can be inferred from the premise.label: 1"
6222,Cruise gathers Brad Pitt into one of many homoerotic embraces in Interview With the Vampire and soars with him high into the night sky.,Cruise held Brad Pitt's hand and took him with him as he soared up into the sky. ,0,1,False,"step 1: in the premise, cruise gathers brad pitt into an embrace and soars up into the night sky with him. this implies a close physical interaction between cruise and pitt, with cruise having the ability to fly. the hypothesis suggests a similar scenario but focuses on cruise holding pitt's hand while ascending. given that cruise is flying and holding pitt's hand are not contradictory, and both actions are plausible in the context of fantastical elements present in interview with the vampire.step 2: the hypothesis can be logically inferred from the premise as holding someone's hand is a natural and expected behavior during a close embrace, especially when flying. since the premise establishes that cruise has the ability to fly and has an intimate embrace with brad pitt, it follows that cruise could hold pitt's hand while flying.step 3: based on the logical reasoning, common sense, and lack of contradictory facts, the hypothesis is a valid inference from the premise."
6223,There should be someone here who knew more of what was going on in this world than he did now.,Everyone knew more of what was going on in the world than him. ,1,0,False,"step 1: in the premise, it is stated that there exists at least one person who knows more about the world than the speaker. this implies that knowledge is not limited to the speaker, and others have access to more information.step 2: the hypothesis suggests that every person knows more than the speaker about the world. this statement is a stronger claim than the premise, as it implies that there are no individuals who possess equal or lesser knowledge than the speaker. however, since the premise already establishes that there is someone who knows more, it does not contradict the hypothesis.step 3: the hypothesis can be seen as a generalization of the premise, and while it goes beyond the information provided in the premise, it does not contradict it. thus, the hypothesis could be a reasonable inference, but it also requires the assumption that the knowledge distribution is evenly spread among all individuals, which is not explicitly stated in the premise. therefore, the hypothesis may not be strictly entailed but is closely related to the premise.step 4: in conclusion, while the hypothesis extends the premise's scope, it does not contradict it. the hypothesis implies that everyone has more knowledge than the speaker, which is a stronger statement than the premise's 'someone' but still a reasonable inference."
6224,"Don't ask me to explain it; it was long ago, and all I know for sure is that it happened.","I would love to try explain; it was only yesterday, I have no idea what heppened",0,0,True,"step 1: the premise indicates an uncertain event from the past with no specific details about what was happening. it does not provide any information about the speaker's current state of mind or their willingness to explain. the hypothesis, on the other hand, suggests a different scenario where the speaker is eager to explain an event.step 2: there is no logical connection or contradiction between the premise and hypothesis, as they describe different scenarios. the hypothesis does not follow directly from the premise, as the premise does not provide enough information to infer the hypothesis.step 3: based on the given information, the hypothesis cannot be logically inferred from the premise. it is important to note that making assumptions beyond the provided information could lead to incorrect conclusions."
6225,well i'm a i'm a Buffalo Bills fan,I cannot stand the Buffalo Bills.,0,0,True,"step 1: the premise states that the speaker identifies themselves as a fan of the buffalo bills. being a fan implies having a strong affinity or attachment to a particular team. step 2: the hypothesis asserts that the speaker cannot stand the buffalo bills. this statement contradicts the fan identification as it suggests a strong dislike or antipathy towards the team. step 3: based on the given information, the hypothesis is not logically entailed by the premise. in fact, the hypothesis contradicts the premise."
6226,yeah too many trips around the yard with that thing huh for sure,Not enough trips around the lawn with it. ,0,0,True,"step 1: in the premise, the speaker is expressing their opinion that there have been 'too many trips around the yard' with 'that thing'. this implies that the speaker believes the number of trips made with 'that thing' in the yard is excessive. step 2: the hypothesis states the opposite opinion, 'not enough trips around the lawn with it'. this contradicts the premise, as the opinions expressed are in direct opposition to each other. step 3: given that the hypothesis contradicts the premise, it cannot be logically inferred from the premise."
6227,you can't just tell them that anyway but  oh dear well it really sounds like uh uh a business more than a hobby,"You do it so seriously, it seems like it's a professional thing.",1,1,True,"step 1: in the premise, the speaker acknowledges that they cannot directly state something but implies that the activity in question is more like a business than a hobby. the use of 'it seems like' in the hypothesis suggests an inference based on observed behavior or seriousness.step 2: the hypothesis is consistent with the premise as both suggest that the activity is taken seriously and may have a professional element. the hypothesis does not contradict the premise in any way.step 3: based on the information provided, the hypothesis can be reasonably inferred from the premise. the speaker's inability to directly state something and their observation of seriousness lead to the inference that the activity is a professional thing.step 4: the hypothesis is not a direct statement from the premise, but it is a reasonable and logical conclusion that can be drawn from the information given."
6228,so i'm i'm going to you know try to help her and that will kind of help to get me you know make me want to do things too so yeah,She will do those things with me if I help her.,1,1,True,"step 1: in the premise, the speaker expresses their intention to help someone (her) in order to motivate themselves to do things. this implies a reciprocal relationship, where helping her may lead to her doing things as well. this is a common social dynamic.step 2: the hypothesis states that she will do things with the speaker if he helps her. this is a logical inference from the premise, as the premise suggests that helping her might be a catalyst for her to engage in activities.step 3: based on the logical connection between the premise and hypothesis, the hypothesis can be inferred from the premise."
6229,"4 million, or about 8 percent of total expenditures for the two programs).",about 2 million is equal to 8 percent of expenditures.,0,1,False,"step 1. in the premise, we have a specific amount of money, 4 million, which represents 8 percent of the total expenditures for two programs.step 2. the hypothesis suggests that 2 million is equal to 8 percent of the total expenditures. we need to determine if 2 million could be the 8 percent of the total expenditures, as stated in the premise.step 3. to check this, first, we need to find the total expenditures. according to the premise, 4 million represents 8 percent of the total expenditures. so, the total expenditures are 4 million / 0.08 = 50 million.step 4. now we need to check if 2 million is indeed 8 percent of 50 million. to calculate this, we find 8 percent of 50 million: 50 million * 0.08 = 4 million.since the premise states that 4 million is the amount representing 8 percent of the total expenditures, and we've just shown that 2 million is also 8 percent of the total expenditures (which is 50 million), it follows that 2 million is equal to 8 percent of 50 million.step 5. in conclusion, the hypothesis is logically inferred from the premise as they both describe the same relationship between the 8 percent of the total expenditures and the numerical representation of that amount."
6230,"Once approved, by signature, the form without the supporting documents was forwarded to Treasury (for civil agencies) or another unit under the disbursing officer (for DOD) for actual payment.",This is so they can get paid quicker.,1,0,False,"step 1: in the premise, it is stated that the form without the supporting documents is forwarded to the treasury or another unit under the disbursing officer for actual payment. this indicates a process where forms are reviewed, approved, and then sent to the appropriate entity for payment. there's no information suggesting a delay in payment due to the lack of supporting documents. step 2: the hypothesis implies that a lack of supporting documents leads to quicker payment. this goes against common sense and established procedures, as supporting documents are typically required for payment processing to ensure accuracy and compliance. step 3: based on the given information and logical principles, the hypothesis cannot be logically inferred from the premise. in fact, the hypothesis contradicts the established process described in the premise."
6231,"The Department finds it is possible that some low-income families with children in tier II day care homes may bear some of the costs, but states may offset them by opting to increase child care subsidies.",The federal government will cover all of the costs no matter the circumstances.,0,0,True,"step 1: in the premise, it is stated that some low-income families might bear some costs while states could offset them by increasing subsidies. this implies a shared responsibility between families and states for day care costs. the premise does not suggest that the federal government is solely responsible for covering all the costs. common sense and facts do not contradict this interpretation.step 2: the hypothesis, which states that the federal government will cover all of the costs in every circumstance, is in contrast to the premise as it places the sole responsibility on the federal government for the costs. the hypothesis cannot be logically inferred from the premise as it introduces a new condition and changes the scope of responsibility.step 3: based on the logical analysis and the clear distinction between the conditions presented in the premise and the hypothesis, it is concluded that the hypothesis is not entailed by the premise."
6232,I do not feel I have the wisdom and moral elevation to do that.,I think I know enough to do that.,0,0,True,"step 1: the premise expresses a lack of confidence or feeling of inadequacy on the part of the speaker regarding a specific action. the hypothesis, on the other hand, indicates a belief or confidence that the speaker knows enough to do that action.step 2: the hypothesis does not entail the premise because a lack of confidence or feeling of inadequacy does not logically lead to the conclusion that one does not know enough. conversely, believing that one knows enough does not necessarily imply confidence or a feeling of moral elevation.step 3: based on the given information and logical principles, the hypothesis is not entailed by the premise."
6233,Clinton's support for better living through litigation is also based on interest group politics.,Clinton does not support the better living through litigation initiative.,0,0,True,"step 1: in the premise, clinton's support for 'better living through litigation' is attributed to interest group politics. this implies that her motivation for this support might not be genuine but rather influenced by political considerations. step 2: the hypothesis states that clinton does not support the better living through litigation initiative. this contradicts the premise, as the premise states that clinton does indeed have a stance on the issue. step 3: based on the contradictory nature of the hypothesis with the premise, it cannot be logically inferred from the premise.step 4: however, it's important to note that a lack of entailment does not necessarily mean that the hypothesis is false. the hypothesis could still be true, but it's not a logical conclusion that can be drawn from the premise alone."
6234,"While we remain sensitive of the need to maintain our institutional independence, we are working constructively with OPM, OMB, and others to explore opportunities to develop a more fully integrated set of guidance and tools for agencies to address their human capital challenges.",We are working with others to help guide agencies.,1,1,True,"step 1: in the premise, the text indicates that the entity is collaborating with opm, omb, and others to explore opportunities for integrating guidance and tools to help address human capital challenges in agencies. this implies an active role in providing assistance and guidance.step 2: the hypothesis asserts that the entity is 'working with others to help guide agencies.' this statement is a logical consequence of the information in the premise. the premise establishes the setting and context for the collaboration, and the hypothesis simply restates the outcome or goal of the collaboration.step 3: based on the logical relationship between the premise and hypothesis, the hypothesis can be inferred from the premise."
6235,We're meeting tonight.,The whole group is meeting at the library tonight.,1,0,False,"step 1: the premise indicates that 'we' are meeting tonight. this implies that at least two or more people have planned to gather for some purpose. there is no explicit mention of a group or a specific location.step 2: the hypothesis suggests that 'the whole group' is meeting at the library tonight. 'the whole group' implies that all members of a specific group are present. however, the premise does not provide enough information to infer that the group's meeting is taking place at the library.step 3: based on the given information, the hypothesis cannot be logically inferred from the premise as there is no mention of the library in the premise."
6236,"Shaped like a boat, with the Square du Vert-Galant as its prow, the Ile de la City is the ancient heart of Paris, settled by the Celtic Parisii people as early as the third century b.c.",The Ile de la City is shaped like a boot.,0,0,True,"step 1. in the premise, the ile de la city is described as having a shape resembling a boat, specifically with the square du vert-galant as its prow. the term 'prow' refers to the front part of a boat. step 2. a boat and a boot share some similarities in their shapes, both having a pointed front end. however, a boat has a wider body towards the middle, while a boot has a narrower mid-section and a wider base. the premise does not provide enough detail to infer this difference. step 3. although the hypothesis suggests that the ile de la city is shaped like a boot, the premise does not entail this. the boat-like shape mentioned in the premise is a necessary condition for the hypothesis, but it is not a sufficient condition. step 4: based on the information provided, the hypothesis 'the ile de la city is shaped like a boot' cannot be logically inferred from the premise 'shaped like a boat, with the square du vert-galant as its prow, the ile de la city is the ancient heart of paris, settled by the celtic parisii people as early as the third century b.c'."
6237,8 million in relief in the form of emergency housing.,The 8 million dollars for emergency housing was still not enough to solve the problem.,1,0,False,"step 1: in the premise, we have a statement about 8 million dollars being allocated for emergency housing. this amount is presented as a relief measure. step 2: the hypothesis states that the 8 million dollars was not enough to solve the problem. this implies that the problem required more resources than were provided. step 3: based on this information, it is not possible to logically infer the hypothesis from the premise. the premise does not provide enough information to conclude definitively that the 8 million dollars were insufficient. it is possible that the problem was indeed larger than anticipated, but it is also possible that the relief efforts were not efficiently utilized. the premise does not contradict the hypothesis, but it does not logically entail it either."
6238,The site is still an active dig and new discoveries are being made all the time.,The site was home to many artifacts such as statues and jewelry.,1,1,True,"step 1: in the premise, the site is described as an active dig where new discoveries are being made. this implies that there are likely many historical artifacts present at the site, as discoveries of artifacts are a common outcome of archaeological digs. step 2: the hypothesis proposes that the site was home to various artifacts such as statues and jewelry. this hypothesis is consistent with the information identified in the premise, as the presence of new discoveries also implies the presence of historical artifacts. step 3: based on the logical connection between the premise and hypothesis, and the common sense understanding of archaeological digs, the hypothesis can be inferred from the premise.step 4: it is important to note that while the hypothesis is logically consistent with the premise, it does not necessarily mean that the hypothesis is a definitive or complete description of the situation. the hypothesis could be true, but further investigation would be required to confirm its accuracy.step 5: taking into account all the information provided, the hypothesis 'the site was home to many artifacts such as statues and jewelry' is a reasonable inference from the premise 'the site is still an active dig and new discoveries are being made all the time'."
6239,"A second, rare, application is where a highly generalized or universal assertion is being called into question, and we are able to test it through examining one instance.",The second application isn't rare at all and is commonly used.,0,0,True,"step 1: in the premise, a scenario is described where a second application of a generalized or universal assertion is being questioned. the hypothesis suggests that this second application is not rare but commonly used. step 2: the premise does not provide any specific information about the frequency or commonality of the second application. to determine if the hypothesis can be inferred from the premise, we would need additional information. however, the hypothesis itself contradicts the premise's description of the second application as rare. step 3: based on the given information, the hypothesis cannot be logically inferred from the premise, as the premise does not support the conclusion of the hypothesis.step 4: it's important to note that the premise and hypothesis may not be directly related, and making a conclusion about the hypothesis being entailed by the premise based on the given information alone would not be valid. in order to make a definitive conclusion, further context and information would be necessary."
6240,The NYTBR isn't just agnostic on such questions--it doesn't even like to consider them.,The NYTBR is highly opinionated on such issues.,0,0,True,"step 1: the premise states that the new york times book review (nytbr) doesn't like to consider certain questions. this implies a lack of interest or engagement with these topics. step 2: the hypothesis suggests the opposite, that the nytbr is highly opinionated on such issues. if the premise were true and the nytbr truly didn't consider or engage with these issues, it would be inconsistent for the hypothesis to claim that they are highly opinionated on them. step 3: based on the logical contradiction between the premise and hypothesis, the hypothesis cannot be inferred from the premise."
6241,they just won it,They made a successful bid yesterday.,1,1,True,"step 1: the premise 'they just won it' indicates that a group of people have recently achieved success, possibly by winning a competition or bidding on an item. no specific time or method is mentioned in the premise. step 2: the hypothesis 'they made a successful bid yesterday' proposes an action that occurred the previous day and resulted in a successful outcome. making a bid is a common way to win something, especially in the context of auctions or competitions. there is no contradictory information in the premise that would make this hypothesis impossible. step 3: based on the logical connection between 'winning' and 'making a successful bid', the hypothesis can be reasonably inferred from the premise. the premise does not explicitly state that the successful outcome was from a bid, but the hypothesis provides a plausible explanation for the win mentioned in the premise.step 4: the hypothesis is consistent with the given premise, as winning can occur through various means, one of which is making a successful bid. therefore, the hypothesis can be inferred from the premise."
6243,but yeah i've i've talked to some who's really had some bad experience and kind of knock on wood i haven't yet not bad you know i just i'm just shocked at the end of the month,I'm shocked by the volume of people who have had bad experiences.,1,1,True,"step 1: in the premise, the speaker is expressing their personal experience of not having had bad experiences, but having talked to others who have. they also express shock at the end of the month, which could suggest a large number of such experiences. step 2: the hypothesis states that the speaker is shocked by the 'volume' of people who have had bad experiences. this is a reasonable inference from the premise, as the speaker's shock implies a larger number than just a few. step 3: based on the logical connection between the premise and hypothesis, and the common sense understanding of the meaning of 'shocked' and 'volume', the hypothesis can be inferred from the premise."
6244,um i i just think that has something to do with why Latinos are tend to be you know the meek the more meek you know they tend to be more not stand up for their rights as much they're not really sure of what they are i don't think,Latinos don't want to be part of the decision-making process.,1,0,False,"step 1: the premise expresses an opinion suggesting a possible explanation for why latinos are perceived to be meek and less likely to stand up for their rights. it implies a lack of confidence and uncertainty among latinos regarding their identity and rights. step 2: the hypothesis proposes an alternative reason for latinos not being part of decision-making processes. it suggests a disinterest or unwillingness on their part. step 3: although the premise and hypothesis are not contradictory, they focus on different aspects of the issue. the premise explains why latinos might not stand up for their rights, while the hypothesis suggests a reason for their absence in decision-making processes. however, there is not enough information in the given sentences to definitively infer that the hypothesis is logically entailed by the premise. it is possible that the reasons outlined in the premise could contribute to a lack of interest or willingness to participate, but it is not a direct inference. step 4: while the hypothesis is not explicitly ruled out by the premise, it also is not logically entailed. the premise does not provide sufficient evidence to support the hypothesis as a necessary or logical conclusion."
6245,everybody in the dorm watched it i mean everybody you were an outcast if you didn't gather in the TV room at two o'clock in the afternoon to watch this soap i mean people scheduled their class around it and everything so i,"It was the final episode of an evening, prime-time television soap opera.",0,1,False,"step 1: in the premise, it is stated that 'everybody in the dorm watched it' and that 'people scheduled their class around it'. this implies that the event being watched was a significant and popular television show. it is also mentioned that it was a 'soap opera', which is a specific type of television program known for long-running storylines and high viewership. step 2: the hypothesis describes the event as 'the final episode of an evening, prime-time television soap opera'. given the information from the premise, it is reasonable to infer that the final episode of a popular soap opera is the type of event that 'everybody in the dorm watched' and scheduled their classes around. step 3: based on the logical reasoning and the consistency with the common understanding of the context provided in the premise, the hypothesis can be inferred from the premise."
6246,um-hum um-hum yep you were very fortunate,Something bad happened to you recently. ,1,0,False,"step 1: in the premise, the speaker is expressing acknowledgement and gratitude, indicating a positive event or outcome. however, the use of 'yet' or 'but' before the hypothesis could potentially introduce a contradiction or a negative event. however, the absence of such words suggests a simple link between the statements.step 2: the hypothesis 'something bad happened to you recently' is a broad statement that could potentially cover many situations. it is not explicitly mentioned or implied in the premise, but it is not contradictory either. a fortunate event can co-exist with a past negative event.step 3: based on the given information, the hypothesis 'something bad happened to you recently' is not logically entailed by the premise 'um-hum um-hum yep you were very fortunate'. however, it is not a contradiction either. the premise and hypothesis describe two distinct aspects of the same situation, the fortunate event and a past negative event respectively."
6248,yeah a roller and uh i bought one of those that you can screw in uh uh a three foot extension,I bought a roller to paint the wall with.,1,1,True,"step 1: in the premise, the speaker mentions buying a roller and a three-foot extension for it. this implies that the roller is an painting tool. the extension is typically used to increase the reach of the roller for painting larger surfaces or higher areas.step 2: in the hypothesis, it is suggested that the speaker bought a roller for painting a wall. this is a reasonable inference from the premise, as the speaker explicitly mentions a roller and the implied use of it for painting is consistent with the given context.step 3: based on the logical connection between the premise and hypothesis, and the lack of contradictory information, the hypothesis can be inferred from the premise."
6249,Kids are on a amusement ride.,A car is broke down on the side of the road.,0,0,True,"step 1: in the premise, 'kids are on an amusement ride', there is no information indicating any issues with cars or roads. the context is focused on children enjoying an amusement ride. step 2: the hypothesis, 'a car is broke down on the side of the road', is about a different scenario involving a car problem. there is no logical connection or entailment between the premise and hypothesis. step 3: based on the given information, it appears that the premise and hypothesis are unrelated. therefore, the hypothesis cannot be logically inferred from the premise."
6250,Woolens and Woven Goods??,Tea and Coffee?,0,0,True,"step 1: neither the premise nor the hypothesis are directly related as they refer to different categories of things. the premise mentions 'woolens and woven goods', which are textile materials. the hypothesis refers to 'tea and coffee', which are beverages. step 2: the hypothesis cannot be logically inferred from the premise because there is no connection between 'woolens and woven goods' and 'tea and coffee'. neither is a necessary nor a sufficient condition for the other. step 3: based on the lack of logical connection and the different categories of things involved, the hypothesis is not entailed by the premise."
6251,"Then you can hand them over to us right away?""",You can give them to us once we get there?,1,1,True,"step 1: in the premise, the speaker is asking if they can hand over something to the recipient immediately. this implies a current or near-future transfer of possession. the hypothesis suggests a transfer of possession, but it occurs after the reciprocal parties have arrived at a specific location. step 2: the hypothesis can be inferred from the premise because the essential action is the same - a transfer of possession. the difference is only in the timing. the premise does not set any location requirement for the transfer, so it is not a contradiction. step 3: based on the logical similarity between the actions described in the premise and hypothesis, and the lack of contradictory information, the hypothesis can be inferred from the premise."
6252,"The site immediately returned Bradley's official site, a site for news about the 2000 presidential race, information about Medicaid, and books about Bradley.",Bradley's site was promotional and only showed information about his books.,0,0,True,"step 1: in the premise, we have information about bradley's site, which includes news about the 2000 presidential race, information about medicaid, and books about bradley. this implies that the site contains a mix of content, including both informational and promotional materials. common sense tells us that having information about a political campaign, policy details, and personal books is not uncommon for an official website. step 2: the hypothesis suggests that bradley's site only showed information about his books. while it's possible for a website to focus primarily on promotional materials, the premise contradicts this hypothesis, as it explicitly mentions other types of content (news and policy information) on the site. step 3: based on the logical analysis, common sense reasoning, and the contradiction between the premise and hypothesis, the hypothesis is not entailed by the premise."
6253,yeah that that's that's so true i mean they say well you voice your opinion uh uh uh on election day,Voting doesn't do much for us. ,0,0,True,"step 1: in the premise, it is stated that people express their opinions on election day. this implies a democratic process where individuals have the right and opportunity to voice their choices through voting. step 2: the hypothesis suggests that voting doesn't make a difference or have an impact. this contradicts the logical implications of the premise that assumes the significance of expressing opinions through voting. step 3: given the logical inconsistency between the premise and hypothesis, the hypothesis is not entailed by the premise."
6254,"If both have information about Monica, then both are unhappy.",Both will only be happy once they know what Monica's done.,0,0,True,"step 1: in the premise, it is stated that both are unhappy when they have information about monica. this suggests a causal relationship between having information about monica and being unhappy. however, the premise does not provide any information about what makes monica's information unhappy or why knowing more about what monica's done would make them happy.step 2: the hypothesis suggests a possible reason for their unhappiness (lack of knowledge about monica's actions) and their potential happiness (acquiring that knowledge). however, the hypothesis does not directly follow from the premise, as the premise does not state that their unhappiness is due to a lack of knowledge about monica's actions.step 3: based on the given information, the hypothesis is not logically entailed by the premise, as the premise does not provide enough information to support the hypothesis. while the hypothesis is a plausible explanation, it is not a logical one based on the provided information."
6255,Duncan Haigh joined briefly as a live drummer.,"Duncan Haigh joined briefly as a live drummer, but was eventually replaced by Tom Egg as the band's first permanent drummer.",1,1,True,"step 1: in the premise, duncan haigh is introduced as a live drummer for a brief period of time. this information does not necessarily exclude the possibility of him being replaced by another drummer in the future. step 2: the hypothesis adds that duncan haigh was eventually replaced by tom egg. this does not contradict the initial information about duncan haigh being a live drummer, but rather adds an additional detail about what happened after his brief tenure. step 3: the hypothesis can be logically inferred from the premise if we consider the premise as an incomplete description of the sequence of events. the hypothesis provides a more detailed account of the events following duncan haigh's initial joining. step 4: it is also important to note that there are no logical or factual contradictions between the premise and the hypothesis, as both statements refer to duncan haigh's role in the band at different points in time.step 5: based on the given information and logical reasoning, it can be concluded that the hypothesis is a more detailed and complete version of the events described in the premise."
6256,199 Julius ensconced himself comfortably by the side of his victim.,"Julius could not stand the sight of his victim, and left the room.",0,0,True,"step 1: in the premise, 'ensconced himself comfortably' implies a situation where julius was seated or lying down in a relaxed manner, possibly indicating a feeling of contentment or satisfaction. the term 'victim' is not further defined, but it suggests a person who is at the receiving end of an action or situation that is not in their control or best interest. step 2: the hypothesis introduces a contradictory situation where julius 'could not stand the sight of his victim' and 'left the room'. this is not logically entailed by the premise, as there is no mention of julius feeling discomfort or leaving in the premise. step 3: based on the given information, the hypothesis cannot be inferred from the premise."
6257,"Charles Hoy Fort August 6, 1874 – May 3, 1932 was an American writer who specialized in anomalous phenomena.","Charles Hoy Fort (August 6, 1874 – May 3, 1932) was an American writer and researcher who specialized in anomalous phenomena.",1,1,True,"step 1: in the premise, we have information about charles hoy fort being an american writer who specialized in anomalous phenomena. this information establishes the key aspects of who charles hoy fort was and what he did. the hypothesis presents the same information, with no additions or contradictions. step 2: the hypothesis can be logically inferred from the premise because the hypothesis statement is an alternative phrasing of the premise statement. the hypothesis adds no new facts or ideas, and it does not contradict the premise. step 3: based on the logical reasoning and the fact that the hypothesis statement is equivalent to the premise statement, the hypothesis is entailed by the premise."
6259,"Katz-equals-Paine is an awful stretch, but his book invites the comparison.","If you think about it, Katz and Paine are both very similar to Jay.",1,0,False,"step 1: in the premise, katz and paine are mentioned as individuals who, despite having some notable differences, are compared due to certain similarities. the comparison is acknowledged to be a stretch, but the book in question invites this comparison. step 2: the hypothesis suggests that katz and paine share similarities with a third person named jay. while the premise does not explicitly state that katz, paine, and jay share similarities, it does hint that there are similarities between katz and paine that warrant the comparison. therefore, the hypothesis is not a direct logical inference from the premise, but it could be a valid observation if there are indeed similarities between katz, paine, and jay. step 3: based on the information provided, the hypothesis is not logically entailed by the premise as it introduces a new element (jay) and makes a specific claim about the similarities between three individuals. however, if it is established that katz, paine, and jay indeed share similarities, then the hypothesis could be considered a logical inference from the premise. but without further context or evidence, it is not possible to definitively conclude entailment."
6260,"Oh, bother ME! said Tuppence impatiently.",Tuppence patiently asked to be left alone.,0,0,True,"step 1: in the premise, tuppence expresses impatience using the exclamation 'oh, bother me!' this indicates a feeling of annoyance or frustration. there is no explicit statement or implication of tuppence asking to be left alone. common sense and logical principles do not automatically equate an expression of impatience with a request for solitude.step 2: the hypothesis that 'tuppence patiently asked to be left alone' is contradictory to the premise, as 'impatiently' and 'patiently' are opposing states.step 3: based on the given information, the hypothesis 'tuppence patiently asked to be left alone' cannot be logically inferred from the premise 'tuppence impatiently said oh, bother me!'"
6261,"This will be seen clearly in Section 4, where the profitability of rural delivery is calculated for each quintile.","In section 4 it will not be clear yet, you have to wait until section 10.",0,0,True,"step 1: in the premise, it is stated that the profitability of rural delivery will be calculated and made clear in section 4. this implies that the information about profitability in rural areas will be presented and understood in this section. step 2: the hypothesis, however, suggests that it won't be clear yet in section 4, and that one has to wait until section 10. this contradicts the premise, as the hypothesis implies that the information presented in section 4 won't be sufficient or clear enough to understand the profitability of rural delivery. step 3: based on the logical reasoning and the contradiction between the premise and hypothesis, the hypothesis is not entailed by the premise."
6262,It also auditions the most singers to either national American Choral Directors Association honor choirs each year.,It also auditions the most singers to either national or state American Choral Directors Association honor choirs each year.,1,1,True,"step 1: in the premise, it is stated that the organization auditions the most singers to 'national american choral directors association honor choirs each year'. this implies that the organization's auditioning process leads singers to be part of these honor choirs at a national level. it is a common fact and assumption that there are both state and national levels of honor choirs under the american choral directors association. therefore, it is reasonable to consider the broader context that the organization might also audition singers for 'state american choral directors association honor choirs'. step 2: the hypothesis, 'it also auditions the most singers to either national or state american choral directors association honor choirs each year', is an extension of the information provided in the premise, as it includes the possibility of auditions for state-level honor choirs. since the premise does not exclude this possibility, and it is a logical extension of the given information, the hypothesis is a valid inference from the premise. step 3: based on the logical reasoning and the lack of contradictory information, the hypothesis can be inferred from the premise."
6263,and um i also had the supervision that i needed while i was growing up and i hope that i can provide that for my child too,There was no one in my life that I had to lead me in the right direction.,0,0,True,"step 1: the premise indicates that the speaker had the necessary supervision while growing up. this supervision provided guidance and direction, ensuring the speaker's development. step 2: the hypothesis, however, states that there was no one in the speaker's life who led them in the right direction. these two statements are contradictory. the premise implies that someone did indeed lead the speaker in the right direction, while the hypothesis denies this. step 3: therefore, the hypothesis cannot be logically inferred from the premise as they are contradictory statements."
6264,"Following the breakup of those bands, he reemerged as the leader of the New Pornographers in 2000, a band who have enjoyed critical success.","Following the breakup of those bands, he reemerged as the leader of the New Pornographers in 2000, a band who have enjoyed commercial and critical success.",1,1,True,"step 1: in the premise, it is stated that 'he' (implicitly identified as a particular individual) reemerged as the leader of the new pornographers in 2000, and that the band has enjoyed 'critical success'. step 2: the hypothesis echoes the same information provided in the premise but adds the additional detail that the new pornographers have enjoyed 'commercial and critical success'. this detail is consistent with, and an expansion of, the information given in the premise. step 3: the hypothesis can be inferred from the premise because the premise sets the context for the individual's reemergence and the band's success, and the hypothesis adds a more detailed description of the band's success without contradicting the premise.step 4: the hypothesis is not only logically consistent with the premise, but it also provides more specific information that is true if the premise is true, making it a logical inference."
6265,the world several major countries in the world that we deal with all the time don't respect women as business people so a woman president would be,Every country we deal with respect women as business individuals.,0,0,True,"step 1: in the premise, several major countries are identified as not respecting women as business people. this implies that there are countries where women face challenges and discrimination in business. step 2: the hypothesis, on the other hand, states that every country we deal with respect women as business individuals. this claim is a negation of the premise's statement about several countries not respecting women in business. step 3: based on the given information, it is clear that the hypothesis is not entailed by the premise. the premise describes the reality of some countries, while the hypothesis presents an ideal situation that is not supported by the evidence. the hypothesis is a contradiction of the premise and cannot be logically inferred from it."
6266,"Now we have more strychnine, handled by one of the household. ",There was no strychnine present prior to this.,0,0,True,"step 1: in the premise, it is stated that 'we' now have more strychnine in the household, and it is being handled by one of the household members. this implies that strychnine was previously present in the household, but the amount has increased.step 2: the hypothesis contradicts the premise, as it states that 'there was no strychnine present prior to this'. if the hypothesis were true, it would mean that the strychnine appeared out of nowhere, which is not suggested by the premise.step 3: based on the logical negation of the hypothesis, 'there was strychnine present prior to this', we can infer that the hypothesis is not entailed by the premise.step 4: an important consideration is that the premise does not explicitly state that strychnine was not present before the current possession, only that it was not mentioned. the hypothesis makes an absolute claim about the past absence of strychnine, and it cannot be logically inferred from the premise alone.therefore, the hypothesis is not entailed by the premise."
6267,Sufficient money and party regulars and money have been assembled to make the primaries and indeed the general election even more than usually irrelevant.,The election funds were almost 200 million dollars.,1,1,True,"step 1: in the premise, it is stated that sufficient funds and party regulars have been assembled to make the primaries and general election 'more than usually irrelevant'. the term 'irrelevant' implies that the outcome of the election is not going to be influenced by the voters' choices or their issues because the election has been bought out. the amount of money mentioned is not specified, but it is clear that it is substantial and more than usual.step 2: in the hypothesis, it is stated that the election funds were 'almost 200 million dollars'. this hypothesis can be logically inferred from the premise because the premise already indicates that the funds are substantial and more than usual. the hypothesis provides a specific numerical value for the funds, which falls within the range of implication from the premise.step 3: based on the logical reasoning and the lack of contradictory information, the hypothesis can be inferred from the premise."
6268,when when you get sequestered and you're there for months,You can leave immediately when you're sequestered.,0,0,True,"step 1: in the premise, being sequestered implies being confined to a particular place for an extended period of time, typically several months. this is a well-established meaning of the term 'sequestered'. step 2: the hypothesis suggests the ability to leave the sequestered location immediately. this directly contradicts the information in the premise, as the premise establishes a situation where leaving immediately is not an option. step 3: the hypothesis cannot be logically inferred from the premise because it contradicts the key information provided in the premise.step 4: it's important to note that the premise and hypothesis do not have to share the same meaning or implications for the hypothesis to be inferred from the premise. however, in this case, the hypothesis directly contradicts the premise, making it an incorrect inference."
6269,This festival features giant carp streamers flying from poles throughout Japan.,The festival is the largest one held in Japan.  ,1,0,False,"step 1: in the premise, we have a description of a festival in japan where giant carp streamers are flying from poles. this information does not directly provide any quantitative data about the size of the festival in comparison to other festivals in japan. however, the use of the term 'largest' in the hypothesis implies a comparison to other festivals.step 2: the hypothesis is not logically entailed by the premise. the premise merely establishes that the festival in question is one that features giant carp streamers. it does not provide sufficient information to determine if it is the largest festival in japan or not.step 3: based on the given information, the hypothesis cannot be logically inferred from the premise."
6270,and the only thing you can remember is to try and stay together as much as you can because it's very easy to uh become go your own direction when you're so when you're working so hard and going to school too,Your bond becomes stronger when you go to school and work.  ,0,0,True,"step 1: in the premise, the speaker emphasizes the importance of staying together while working hard and going to school. this implies that the speaker experiences challenges and distractions that could potentially pull them apart. however, they choose to persevere and maintain their bond. step 2: the hypothesis suggests an opposite but compatible scenario - instead of the bond weakening due to the demands of school and work, it strengthens. this is not an illogical idea as some relationships can thrive under pressure and shared experiences. step 3: while the premise does not directly entail the hypothesis, it does not contradict it either. the lack of contradiction, combined with the possibility of a strengthened bond in the context of shared challenges, makes the hypothesis a reasonable inference from the premise.step 4: it's also worth noting that the speaker's perspective in the premise might not be universally applicable. while some people might find their bonds weakening when facing the demands of school and work, others might find that their bonds become stronger. the hypothesis, in this sense, could be a generalization based on the speaker's experience.step 5: to summarize, the hypothesis is not logically entailed by the premise but it is a reasonable inference based on the common experience of people finding their relationships stronger under pressure and the lack of contradiction between the two statements."
6271,It involves predicting the percentage of total cost devoted to mail processing and delivery.,There is no way that an attempt can be made to predict the costs of mail delivery.,0,0,True,"step 1: the premise refers to predicting a percentage of total cost related to mail processing and delivery. this implies that it is possible to determine some portion of mail-related costs. step 2: the hypothesis suggests that it is impossible to predict the costs of mail delivery. however, the premise does not state or imply that it is impossible to predict mail delivery costs, only that a percentage of the total mail costs will be predicted. step 3: the hypothesis cannot be logically inferred from the premise as the premise does not limit or negate the ability to predict mail delivery costs."
6272,"Did Johnny Shannon suggest using Shiloh for bait, or was that your idea? ",One of you thought using Shiloh as bait was a good idea.,1,1,True,"step 1: in the premise, there are two possibilities presented: johnny shannon suggested using shiloh as bait or it was your idea. both suggest that one of you had the thought of using shiloh for bait. step 2: the hypothesis also suggests that one of you had the idea of using shiloh as bait. this is logically consistent with the premise as it doesn't contradict any information provided. step 3: based on the logical consistency of the hypothesis with the premise and the absence of contradictory information, the hypothesis can be inferred from the premise."
6273,He showed no signs of buckling under physical work that would have killed him on his own world.,He was certain to die despite the easy nature of the work he was performing.,0,0,True,"step 1: in the premise, it is stated that the person showed no signs of being affected by physical work that would have been fatal for him on his own world. this implies that the person has a high tolerance for physical work. step 2: the hypothesis, however, suggests that the person was certain to die despite the easy nature of the work. this contradicts the information provided in the premise, as the absence of signs of distress implies that the person was not dying at the time. step 3: based on the logical analysis, the hypothesis cannot be inferred from the premise as it contradicts the information provided."
6274,"Intent on not striking out, he bats pitch after pitch into foul territory.",He hit foul balls for an hour.,1,1,True,"step 1: in the premise, the subject's intent is to avoid striking out. he is repeatedly making contact with the ball, but the balls are not fair hits, as they go into foul territory. this scenario implies that the man is making several attempts to hit the ball, which could take an extended period of time.step 2: the hypothesis suggests that the man hit foul balls for an hour. this hypothesis can be logically inferred from the premise. in order to hit foul balls for an hour, the man must have been making attempts to hit the ball during that time frame. the premise states that he is making these attempts, and there is no contradiction or additional information provided that would negate the hypothesis.step 3: based on the logical reasoning and the given information, the hypothesis is entailed by the premise."
6275,"While Zimbabwe's Minister of Information Chen Chimutengwende justified the land-seizure plan by saying that the government was only protecting white farmers from black peasants who, otherwise, would rise up and kill [them], Mugabe had defiantly stated that he intended to go ahead with the seizures, the Star reported.",Zimbabwe thought they had no claim against private lands.,0,0,True,"step 1: in the premise, chen chimutengwende, zimbabwe's minister of information, justifies the land-seizure plan by stating that the government was protecting white farmers from black peasants who would kill them. mugabe, defiantly, states his intent to go ahead with the seizures. this information does not directly mention zimbabwe's perspective on having a claim against private lands. however, it does suggest underlying tension and conflict between the white farmers and black peasants.step 2: the hypothesis, 'zimbabwe thought they had no claim against private lands,' is not logically entailed by the premise. the premise does not provide enough information to infer that zimbabwe held such a belief. the actions of the government and the statements of the minister and mugabe do not necessarily imply that they believed they had no claim against private lands.step 3: based on the given premise and the logical principles, no entailment can be established between the premise and the hypothesis."
6276,"Is he one of them, do you think? she breathed.",She wasn't sure if he one was of them.,1,1,True,"step 1: in the premise, the speaker, 'she', is expressing uncertainty about whether 'he' is a member of a certain group, 'them'. no specific information is given about the nature of 'them' or 'he'. common sense and logical principles do not dictate an answer here, as 'them' could refer to any group, and 'he' could be anyone. thus, no key information or relationships can be identified from the premise, but the uncertainty expressed suggests a potential for the hypothesis to be a valid inference.step 2: the hypothesis, 'she wasn't sure if he was one of them', directly relates to the premise, as it expresses the same uncertainty. the hypothesis can be considered a restatement of the premise.step 3: given the premise's lack of specific information and the hypothesis's restatement of the premise's uncertainty, it can be inferred that the hypothesis is entailed by the premise. the hypothesis is a logically valid inference from the premise, as it does not contradict the information provided and expands upon the uncertainty expressed.step 4: based on the logical reasoning, the lack of contradictory information, and the common-sense understanding of uncertainty, the hypothesis is entailed by the premise."
6277,"In this the Christmas season, when tasty sweaters and snuggly cheeses are on everyone's gift list, it's traditional to reflect on where it all began.",Way too many people don't understand the meaning of Christmas.,1,0,False,"step 1: the premise describes the christmas season, mentioning tasty sweaters, snuggly cheeses, and the tradition of reflecting on the origins of the holiday. it does not provide any direct information about people's understanding or lack thereof of the meaning of christmas.step 2: the hypothesis states that 'way too many people don't understand the meaning of christmas.' it is a claim that contradicts the general sentiment of the premise. although the premise doesn't mention everyone having a clear understanding of christmas, it doesn't suggest that 'way too many people' lack that understanding either.step 3: based on the provided information, it is not logically entailed that 'way too many people don't understand the meaning of christmas.' the hypothesis contradicts the premise, but the premise does not provide sufficient evidence to support the hypothesis.step 4: the hypothesis is not entailed by the premise."
6278,"Despite increasing urbanization and social change, Japanese society retains its small, closely knit communities strongly dependent on Shinto gods to ensure good harvests for survival.","Urbanization and social change has radically morphed the Japanese way of life, no longer depending on Shinto gods.",0,0,True,"step 1: the premise describes japanese society as being urbanized and undergoing social change, but also mentions the strong dependence on shinto gods for good harvests. this implies a historical context where these communities relied on shinto gods for their survival. step 2: the hypothesis suggests that urbanization and social change have led to a radical transformation of japanese life, such that they no longer depend on shinto gods. this contradicts the premise, as it maintains the existence of this dependency. step 3: based on the information provided, the hypothesis cannot be logically inferred from the premise. in fact, the premise suggests the opposite, that despite urbanization and social change, japanese society continues to depend on shinto gods."
6279,It jumped again after Congress demanded that the IRS prevent cheating on the Earned Income Tax Credit.,The stock market is involved.,1,0,False,"step 1: in the premise, we have an event where congress demanded action from the irs to prevent earned income tax credit cheating. this is a policy-related issue. there's no mention of the stock market in the premise.step 2: the hypothesis suggests involvement of the stock market. the premise does not directly provide this information.step 3: based on the given information, the hypothesis cannot be logically inferred from the premise as there is no connection between the two. the premise only discusses congress's demand to the irs and the resultant action, while the hypothesis introduces a completely different topic: the stock market. without further context or information, there is no logical entailment between the premise and hypothesis."
6281,"Only two synagogues, the Ha'Ari and the Caro, are of real note.",Both of these synagogues are quite large and beautiful.,1,0,False,"step 1: in the premise, it is stated that the ha'ari and the caro synagogues are of real note. the term 'of real note' generally implies significance or importance. no information is provided about the size or beauty of these synagogues. step 2: the hypothesis describes both synagogues as being quite large and beautiful. this is a possible description for significant or important structures. it is common sense that significant or important buildings can be large and beautiful. step 3: the hypothesis is not directly entailed by the premise, as the premise does not provide enough information to logically infer the size and beauty of the synagogues. however, the hypothesis is consistent with the premise and is a reasonable assumption based on common sense and the given context. step 4: while the hypothesis cannot be logically inferred from the premise, it is not contradictory to it, and the premise does not provide sufficient reason to reject the hypothesis. thus, in the absence of contradictory information, it is reasonable to consider the hypothesis as a plausible assumption. step 5: in conclusion, the hypothesis is not logically entailed by the premise, but it is a reasonable assumption based on common sense and the given context."
6282,"It also gives guidance to the manager who, in reviewing completed case studies, wants to assess their strengths.",The managers frequently are reviewing case studies.,1,1,True,"step 1: in the premise, it is stated that the guidance provided helps the manager in assessing the strengths of completed case studies. this implies that the manager is involved in the process of reviewing case studies. step 2: the hypothesis suggests that the managers 'frequently' review case studies. since the premise already indicates that the managers are reviewing case studies, the hypothesis is not a new statement but a more specific or quantified version of the premise. in logic, if the premise entails the hypothesis, then the hypothesis is entailed by the premise. step 3: based on the logical relationship between the premise and hypothesis, the hypothesis is entailed by the premise."
6283,A boy is posing next to his scooter.,A boy is next to a scooter.,1,1,True,"step 1: in the premise, a boy is identified as being in a specific location next to a scooter. this information establishes a relationship between the boy and the scooter. there are no logical inconsistencies or contradictions in the premise.step 2: the hypothesis states that the boy is 'next to' a scooter, which is the same relationship described in the premise. therefore, the hypothesis can be logically inferred from the premise as it does not add or contradict any information.step 3: based on the logical equivalence between the premise and hypothesis, and the absence of contradictory information, the hypothesis can be inferred from the premise."
6284,"Shiloh tossed his head, looked over his shoulder at Drew, who entered the stall and began quieting the stallion with hands drawn gently over the back and up the arch of the neck.",Drew and Shiloh were at the mall.,0,0,True,"step 1. in the premise, shiloh is a stallion and drew is calming him down at a stable or barn setting, as indicated by drew's actions and shiloh's reaction. no mention is made of a mall or any other location.step 2. the hypothesis 'drew and shiloh were at the mall' is not logically entailed by the premise as there is no information in the premise that supports or infers a mall setting. the actions described in the premise are not consistent with being at a mall.step 3. based on the given information and logical principles, the hypothesis is not entailed by the premise."
6285,Look for the Galerie des Rois across the top of the three doorways.,The Galerie des Rois is located on the floor of the doorways.,0,0,True,"step 1: the premise describes the location of the galerie des rois as being 'across the top' of the three doorways. this implies that the galerie des rois is something that can be seen at the top of the doorways, possibly an inscription or a decorative feature. this information does not suggest that it is located on the floor.step 2: the hypothesis proposes an entirely different location for the galerie des rois, on the floor of the doorways. however, the premise does not provide any information or logical connection to support this hypothesis.step 3: based on the given information, the hypothesis is not logically entailed by the premise. the hypothesis contradicts the premise as it suggests a different location for the galerie des rois."
6286,The OASIS would provide potential customers with information needed to obtain the open access non-discriminatory service required by the Commission's companion rule.,There is no information available to potential customers.,0,0,True,"step 1. in the premise, it is stated that the oasis (open access single sign-on) would provide potential customers with necessary information for obtaining the open access non-discriminatory service required by the commission's companion rule. this implies that the oasis serves as a source of important information for potential customers to comply with the commission's rule.step 2. the hypothesis contradicts the premise, stating that 'there is no information available to potential customers'. this contradicts the premise's assumption that the oasis will provide the required information.step 3. based on the logical reasoning, the hypothesis is not entailed by the premise. in fact, the hypothesis is the opposite of what the premise suggests."
6287,i mean i think they're doing their duty but i think if they're going to come out and kill somebody else then they deserve it,They never deserve punishment when they do their duty.,0,0,True,"step 1: the premise expresses a personal opinion that individuals, possibly law enforcement or soldiers, may deserve punishment if they kill someone, but they are doing their duty. the hypothesis states that they never deserve punishment when they do their duty.step 2: the hypothesis contradicts the premise, as the premise acknowledges a situation where individuals may deserve punishment for taking a life, while the hypothesis states that they never deserve punishment for doing their duty.step 3: based on the given information, the hypothesis cannot be logically inferred from the premise as they present contradictory viewpoints."
6288,"Further, such documentation must be complete before auditors issue their report.",The documentation contains minor errors and flaws.,1,0,False,"step 1: in the premise, it is stated that documentation must be complete before auditors issue their report. this implies that the documentation is expected to be free from significant errors or issues that would hinder the auditing process. step 2: the hypothesis suggests that the documentation contains minor errors and flaws, which is a less severe issue than significant errors or issues that would prevent the completion of the documentation. a minor error or flaw would not necessarily prevent the documentation from being considered 'complete'. step 3: while the hypothesis does not logically follow from the premise, it is still possible for the premise and hypothesis to coexist. the presence of minor errors or flaws does not necessarily prevent the documentation from being considered 'complete'. therefore, the hypothesis is not entailed by the premise, but it is not a contradiction either.step 4: it's important to note that the absence of a logical entailment relationship between the premise and hypothesis does not mean that the hypothesis is incorrect or invalid, it just means that the hypothesis cannot be logically deduced from the premise alone. the presence or absence of minor errors or flaws in the documentation does not change the requirement for completion before the auditors issue their report."
6289,"Cybercitizens will be hard-wired, and entertainment as we know it will be in the form of IPOs.",People will have to order and pay for their entertainment someday.,1,0,False,"step 1: in the premise, 'cybercitizens will be hard-wired' refers to a hypothetical future state where individuals are connected to the internet or digital world in a more integrated way. 'entertainment as we know it will be in the form of ipos' means that interactive performance offerings or investments will replace traditional forms of entertainment. step 2: the hypothesis, 'people will have to order and pay for their entertainment someday', is a general statement about the necessity of payment for entertainment services. this statement is consistent with the premise as both the premise and hypothesis are discussing the future of entertainment. however, the hypothesis does not follow directly from the premise as the premise does not explicitly mention the need for payment. step 3: although the hypothesis cannot be logically inferred from the premise alone, it is not contradictory to it. in the future described by the premise, entertainment could still require payment even if it is in a digital or interactive form, as suggested by the hypothesis. thus, the hypothesis is not entailed by the premise but remains plausible within its context."
6290,The pattern shown by these graphs is clear.,The graphs also highlight trends in related industries.,1,0,False,"step 1: a clear pattern in the graphs refers to a discernible and consistent arrangement of data points or trends. the premise does not specify the nature of the pattern, but it implies that it is significant and noticeable. step 2: the hypothesis suggests that the graphs may reveal trends not just within the industry they depict, but also in related industries. this inference is reasonable because trends in one industry can often influence or be influenced by trends in other related industries. thus, the hypothesis is not a direct entailment of the premise, but it is a logical extension based on the information provided. step 3: although the hypothesis is not an immediate consequence of the premise, it can be reasonably inferred from it. the premise's 'clear pattern' indicates the presence of significant trends in the data, and the hypothesis suggests that those trends may extend to related industries. the hypothesis is consistent with the facts and logic of the premise, and it does not contradict it. step 4: based on these considerations, the hypothesis can be considered a probable inference from the premise, even though it is not an entailment."
6291,yeah some of my favorite groups are like Chicago and uh oh some of the i guess what what you could call softer rock groups they were the bigger groups in the seventies and  till all the heavy metal and all that came in and,"Earth, Wind, & Fire are another one of my favorites.",1,1,True,"step 1: in the premise, the speaker mentions their favorite groups being chicago and 'softer rock' bands that were popular in the 70s. this indicates a preference for certain types of music from that era. 'softer rock' is a genre that includes bands like earth, wind, & fire. therefore, based on the information provided, it is reasonable to infer that earth, wind, & fire could be among the speaker's favorite groups.step 2: the hypothesis 'earth, wind, & fire are another one of my favorites' is consistent with the premise as it does not contradict any information given. furthermore, it can be logically inferred based on the speaker's stated preferences for 'chicago' and 'softer rock' groups from the 70s.step 3: the hypothesis 'earth, wind, & fire are another one of my favorites' can be inferred from the premise given the logical connection and consistency between the two statements, as well as the common sense understanding that the speaker's stated preferences for certain types of music in the given era imply a likelihood of enjoying earth, wind, & fire."
6292,and they'll just go out and do anything they can to do it,They will not do anything the can.,0,0,True,"step 1: in the premise, 'they' are described as going out and doing anything they can. 'anything they can' implies a lack of restriction or limitation on their actions. step 2: the hypothesis states 'they will not do anything they can'. this is the opposite of what the premise states. thus, the hypothesis contradicts the premise. step 3: based on the logical reasoning, the hypothesis cannot be inferred from the premise as they present incompatible information."
6293,i enjoy reading novels then uh you know more serious stuff,Serious books are better than silly books.,1,0,False,"step 1: in the premise, the speaker expresses a preference for reading novels, which implies a certain level of enjoyment or interest in serious literature. however, the statement does not necessarily imply an evaluation of the quality of 'serious stuff' over 'silly books'. step 2: in the hypothesis, a judgement is made about the quality of 'serious books' being better than 'silly books'. this judgement is not directly stated or implied in the premise. step 3: the hypothesis cannot be logically inferred from the premise as the premise does not provide enough information to make that conclusion."
6294,"If you missed the link on why conservatives who want to eliminate the NEA don't make the point that there is a multibillion dollar arts subsidy embedded in the tax code, click .",You might have seen why conservatives against the NEA don't discuss a multibillion dollar arts subsidy hidden in it. ,1,1,True,"step 1: the premise is discussing a common observation about conservatives and their arguments against the national endowment for the arts (nea). it suggests that there is a multibillion dollar arts subsidy hidden in the tax code, which conservatives do not often mention in their criticisms of the nea.step 2: the hypothesis is stating a possible explanation for why this is the case - that you might have seen why conservatives do not discuss this subsidy. it is logically consistent with the premise, as the hypothesis does not contradict the information provided in the premise.step 3: based on the logical consistency and the fact that the hypothesis provides a reasonable explanation for the observed phenomenon, it can be inferred that the hypothesis is entailed by the premise.step 4: it is important to note that this inference is based on the given information and does not make any assumptions beyond it."
6295,"The most common types of amok are made with fish, chicken as the main proteins.","The most common types of amok are made with fish, beef, or chicken as the main proteins.",1,1,True,"step 1: in the premise, it is stated that the most common types of amok are made with fish and chicken as the main proteins. this information is factual and does not contradict common sense or logical principles. step 2: the hypothesis expands the premise by adding 'beef' as another potential main protein. this addition does not contradict the premise, as the premise only specifies 'fish' and 'chicken' as the main proteins, not as the exclusive ones. step 3: based on the given information, the hypothesis can be inferred from the premise because the premise does not restrict the types of proteins to only fish and chicken. the hypothesis is a more generalized version of the premise."
6296,and i i just think that it's kind of i do n't know it's kind of cruel you know they just they just breed these they breed them before they're ready uh and,They should be a few years old before they are bread,1,0,False,"step 1. in the premise, the speaker is expressing their opinion that it's cruel to breed animals before they're ready. no specific breeding age is mentioned. in the hypothesis, there is a suggested age requirement for breeding.step 2. the hypothesis is related to the premise as both discuss breeding animals. the hypothesis proposes a solution to the perceived cruelty issue mentioned in the premise by suggesting an age requirement for breeding. there are no contradictions in the information provided.step 3. based on the logical connection between the two statements and the common-sense understanding that animals, especially those bred for companionship, can benefit from maturity before breeding, the hypothesis can be reasonably inferred from the premise.step 4: the hypothesis is not a direct logical entailment of the premise since the premise does not provide an age requirement for breeding. however, the hypothesis can be inferred as a possible implication or solution to address the perceived issue mentioned in the premise."
6297,"Kidney disease, also known as renal disease, is damage to or disease of a kidney.","Kidney disease, also known as nephropathy or renal disease, is damage to or disease of a kidney.",1,1,True,"step 1: in the premise, 'kidney disease' is defined as damage or disease to a kidney. 'nephropathy' and 'renal disease' are alternative terms for 'kidney disease'. therefore, the key information in the premise is that 'kidney disease' refers to damage or disease of a kidney.step 2: the hypothesis is identical to the premise, with the only difference being the use of 'nephropathy' and 'renal disease' instead of 'kidney disease'. since 'nephropathy' and 'renal disease' are synonymous with 'kidney disease', the hypothesis is logically equivalent to the premise.step 3: given that the hypothesis is a synonym for the premise, it is logically entailed by the premise."
6298,"And what, exactly, is a program manager?",Exactly what is a Executive Program Manager?,1,1,True,"step 1. the premise is asking for a definition or explanation of a 'program manager'. this role typically entails overseeing various aspects of a project or a group of projects, ensuring they are completed on time, within budget, and meet the desired quality. step 2. the hypothesis is proposing an exact match, asking for a definition or explanation of an 'executive program manager'. while the title implies a higher-level or more senior role within program management, the added descriptor 'executive' does not fundamentally change the nature of the role. thus, the hypothesis can be logically inferred from the premise as a specific type or title of a program manager. step 3. based on the logical reasoning and the assumption that 'executive program manager' is a subtype or title of 'program manager', the hypothesis is entailed by the premise."
6299,This injection system is principally made from piping that may split off to manifolds for injecting in multiple locations.,The injection system is made of piping and can break off in the cold.,1,0,False,"step 1: in the premise, the injection system is described as being primarily made of piping, which may branch off to manifolds for multiple injection points. the piping material is not specified. step 2: the hypothesis suggests that the injection system, made of piping, can break off in the cold. this implication does not directly contradict the premise, but it does add a new piece of information that may or may not be entailed by the premise. in the absence of any additional context or information, it's not possible to definitively say that the hypothesis is entailed by the premise or not. however, there are a few considerations that can help us understand the relationship between the two.step 3: the hypothesis introduces the possibility of the piping material being brittle and prone to breaking off when subjected to cold temperatures. while the premise does not provide this information, it does not contradict it either. it is common for certain materials to become brittle in extremely cold temperatures, and piping is a material type that can be susceptible to such conditions. however, there is no mention of the temperature conditions in the premise, so it's unclear if the hypothesis is actually entailed by the premise or not.step 4: in order to determine the entailment relationship between the premise and hypothesis, we would need additional information. for example, if we knew that the piping material used in the injection system is known to be brittle and prone to breaking in cold temperatures, then the hypothesis would be a logical consequence of the premise. on the other hand, if we knew that the piping material used in the injection system is known to be heat-resistant and not prone to breaking off under normal operating conditions, then the hypothesis would be contradicted by the premise. in the absence of such information, it's impossible to definitively determine the entailment relationship between the two.based on the available information, the hypothesis is not directly entailed by the premise. the premise only describes the composition of the injection system and does not provide any information about the material properties, temperature conditions, or other relevant factors that would allow us to logically infer the hypothesis from the premise."
6300,well you know we lived in Colorado for,We've never been to Colorado.,0,0,True,"step 1: in the premise, it is stated that 'we lived in colorado'. this indicates a past residence in colorado. no specific information about the present or future is mentioned. step 2: the hypothesis, 'we've never been to colorado', contradicts the premise as it states that the subjects have never been to colorado, while the premise states that they have lived there. step 3: based on the given information, the hypothesis is not entailed by the premise, as they directly contradict each other."
6301,The discussions have also enabled us to pinpoint areas where federal agencies can benefit from integrating the practices of such leading organizations in their respective organizations.,The discussions have failed to help us pinpoint anything.,0,0,True,"step 1: in the premise, it is stated that discussions have helped identify areas for improvement in federal agencies through the integration of leading organizations' practices. this implies a productive outcome from the discussions.step 2: the hypothesis, on the other hand, suggests a failure to identify any areas of improvement, which contradicts the information presented in the premise.step 3: a failure to identify any areas of improvement cannot be logically inferred from the premise about productive discussions. therefore, the hypothesis is not entailed by the premise.step 4: the hypothesis is a clear contradiction to the premise, as it states an opposite outcome.thus, based on the logical reasoning, the hypothesis is not entailed by the premise."
6302,yeah well last year i had a campaign to lose about uh twenty pounds and uh i wound up swimming about three hundred and sixty miles during the year,"In addition to swimming, I also modified my  diet in order to lose weight.",1,1,True,"step 1: in the premise, the speaker mentions that they had a campaign to lose about twenty pounds last year and they swam about three hundred and sixty miles during the year. this implies that swimming was a significant part of their weight loss strategy. however, it does not provide any explicit information about diet modifications. step 2: in the hypothesis, it is suggested that in addition to swimming, the speaker modified their diet to lose weight. this is a reasonable assumption, as modifying diet is a common strategy for weight loss. step 3: the hypothesis can be logically inferred from the premise because the premise establishes that the speaker was actively trying to lose weight through physical activity (swimming), and it is common sense that diet modifications are often necessary for successful weight loss. step 4: furthermore, there is no contradictory information in the premise that would make the hypothesis impossible. step 5: based on the logical reasoning, common sense, and lack of contradictory facts, the hypothesis can be inferred from the premise."
6303,"For instance, one state government CIO attributed his success to his breadth of experience across a variety of financial, retail, and IT units, which facilitates his ability to",He was proud of what he had accomplished.,1,1,True,"step 1: in the premise, the state government cio is described as attributing his success to his diverse experience. this implies that he recognizes the value of his experience in enabling him to be effective in his role as a cio. step 2: pride is a feeling of satisfaction or self-approval with regard to an achievement. given that the cio has attributed his success to his experience, it is reasonable to infer that he would feel proud of what he had accomplished. step 3: the hypothesis 'he was proud of what he had accomplished' can be logically inferred from the premise as the premise sets up the context for the feeling of pride. step 4: the hypothesis is a natural and expected outcome based on the information provided in the premise.step 5: the hypothesis does not contradict the premise in any way.therefore, the hypothesis can be inferred from the premise."
6304,"Now, I ask you, do I look as though I thought there were the least chance of your killing me?"" He looked confidently round, and was glad they could not hear the persistent beating of his heart which gave the lie to his words.","He was afraid, that they would kill him.",1,0,False,"step 1: in the premise, the speaker denies any fear of being killed and appears confident, but we also have the description of his heart beating persistently, which is a physical sign of fear. this creates a contradiction between the spoken words and the nonverbal cues. step 2: the hypothesis states that the man was afraid, which is the opposite of what he claimed in the premise. it is a reasonable inference that a person might deny their fear, especially in a threatening situation, but their body language or other nonverbal cues might betray their true emotions. step 3: based on the information provided, it seems that the hypothesis is not directly entailed by the premise, as the premise does not explicitly state that the man was not afraid. however, the nonverbal cues and the contradiction between what the man says and what his body reveals suggest that the hypothesis is a plausible explanation for the situation described in the premise."
6305,"Boys in the Band than a gay Big Chill , says Lisa Schwarzbaum of Entertainment Weekly . The New York Times ' Stephen Holden, in dissent, extols the film's richly nuanced performances and its intense mood of Chekhovian sadness.",Holden didn't see the film.,0,0,True,"step 1: the premise states that lisa schwarzbaum of entertainment weekly compares 'boys in the band' to 'a gay big chill.' this is a statement about her opinion or critique of the film. the new york times' stephen holden is mentioned as having a different view, implying that he also wrote about the film. step 2: the hypothesis suggests that holden didn't see the film. this contradicts the premise, as the hypothesis cannot be logically inferred from the premise if holden did indeed write about the film. step 3: based on the given information, the hypothesis is not entailed by the premise. instead, the premise implies that holden wrote about the film and expressed a different opinion."
6306,What if that prosperity is a temporary illusion?,Prosperity is definitely a temporary illusion.,1,0,False,"step 1: in the premise, there is an expression of a question or doubt about the nature of prosperity. it suggests that the speaker or writer is considering the possibility that prosperity may not be as permanent or real as it appears. step 2: the hypothesis states that prosperity is definitely a temporary illusion. this statement is a stronger and more definitive version of the premise's doubt or question. step 3: given that the hypothesis is a logical consequence of the premise, as it represents a more explicit and certain statement of the idea introduced in the premise, it can be inferred from the premise. however, it is important to note that the premise and hypothesis make an assumption about the nature of prosperity, and this assumption may not be factually correct or universally applicable.step 4: while the hypothesis can be logically inferred from the premise, it does not necessarily mean that it is true or entailed by the premise in a factual sense. the premise does not provide any evidence or facts to support the idea that prosperity is always temporary, and the hypothesis goes beyond the information given in the premise by making a definitive statement about the permanence or illusion of prosperity in all cases. therefore, the hypothesis may not be entailed by the premise in a factual or objective sense, but it is a logical consequence of the premise's perspective or assumption."
6307,The abundant fruit grown on the islands in the summer continues to be preserved to last through the cold winters.,Apples are one of the fruits grown on the island.,1,1,True,"step 1: in the premise, it is mentioned that 'the abundant fruit grown on the islands in the summer continues to be preserved to last through the cold winters.' this implies that there is a variety of fruits grown on the islands that are preserved for consumption during the winter. no specific type of fruit is mentioned in the premise, but the context suggests that multiple types of fruits are involved.step 2: the hypothesis 'apples are one of the fruits grown on the island' introduces a new piece of information that is not explicitly stated in the premise. however, it does not contradict the premise as apples are a common type of fruit and there's no mention in the premise that only certain types of fruits are grown on the islands.step 3: the hypothesis can be considered a logical extension of the premise, as the premise does not restrict the types of fruits that can be grown on the islands. therefore, the hypothesis is not logically inconsistent with the premise, and in the absence of contradictory evidence, it can be considered a valid inference.step 4: based on the logical reasoning, the lack of contradictory evidence, and the fact that apples are a common type of fruit, the hypothesis 'apples are one of the fruits grown on the island' can be inferred from the premise."
6308,"She's my cousin, and as patriotic a girl as ever stepped. 181 ""I don't care a damn what she is, but get out of here!"" retorted Tommy also at the top of his voice.",My cousin wasn't to blame for the situation.,1,0,False,"step 1. the premise establishes a relationship between the speaker and the cousin, as well as her patriotic nature. the context does not provide any information regarding the situation or the actions of the cousin that led to the exchange between tommy and the speaker. step 2. the hypothesis suggests that the cousin was not responsible for the situation, but the premise itself does not provide any information about the situation or the actions that might have caused it. the hypothesis does not contradict the information given in the premise, but it does not follow logically from it either. step 3. based on the given information, it cannot be determined if the hypothesis is entailed by the premise. the relationship between the cousin and the speaker does not provide enough context to infer that the cousin was not to blame for the situation."
6309,"A smiling baby wearing a striped shirt, held by a woman with gray hair.",A baby is high fiving his friend who throws him a banana.,0,0,True,"step 1. in the premise, we have several key pieces of information: a smiling baby, the baby wearing a striped shirt, and a woman holding the baby. no actions or relationships are explicitly stated between these entities. step 2. the hypothesis describes an entirely different scenario: a baby high-fiving a friend and receiving a banana. there is no direct connection between the premise and hypothesis. step 3. based on the given information, the hypothesis cannot be logically inferred from the premise."
6310,so i know they treat him good,they treat him well because of his disability,1,0,False,"step 1: the premise 'they treat him good' implies that the subject is being treated kindly or beneficially. it does not provide any explicit information about the reason for this treatment. step 2: the hypothesis 'they treat him well because of his disability' suggests a reason for the good treatment - the subject's disability. this reason is not contradictory to the premise as it is compatible with the idea of 'good' treatment. step 3: this reasoning suggests that the hypothesis can be logically inferred from the premise as the hypothesis provides a plausible explanation for the observed treatment.however, it is important to note that this inference would depend on the context and the available background knowledge. in the absence of such context or knowledge, it would be impossible to definitively determine if the hypothesis is true or not, as the premise does not provide sufficient information to make that determination."
6311," ""How d'you know he'll sign me on?""Anse studied his own unkempt if now clean reflection in the shaving mirror on the wall.",Anse looked at himself in a cracked mirror. ,1,1,True,"step 1: in the premise, anse is preparing himself by studying his reflection in a mirror. the type of mirror is not explicitly stated but is implied to be a functional one based on the description 'shaving mirror'. step 2: the hypothesis describes anse looking at himself in a 'cracked mirror'. while the type of mirror is not specified in the hypothesis, the description 'cracked mirror' does not contradict the premise. in fact, it's reasonable that anse might check his reflection in a different mirror, especially if the first one was used for shaving and he wanted to ensure his appearance. step 3: based on the given information, the hypothesis 'anse looked at himself in a cracked mirror' can be inferred from the premise 'anse studied his own reflection in the shaving mirror on the wall'. although the premise does not explicitly state that anse looked at himself in a cracked mirror, it does not contradict the hypothesis. thus, the hypothesis can be considered a valid but less specific instance of the premise."
6312,"All governments are having problems with finances, Boone Mayor George Maybee said. ",The government is passing a strict budget.,1,0,False,"step 1: in the premise, it is stated that 'all governments are having problems with finances'. this implies a collective financial difficulty among all governments. step 2: the hypothesis suggests that 'the government is passing a strict budget'. a strict budget is a financial measure taken to address financial difficulties. therefore, the hypothesis could be a reasonable response to the financial problems mentioned in the premise. step 3: while the hypothesis is not an exact entailment of the premise - the premise does not guarantee a strict budget is being passed - it is a plausible inference given the information provided.there are scenarios where all governments are facing financial problems but none of them are passing a strict budget. however, the hypothesis is not contradictory to the premise, and it is a possible outcome given the premise's information. thus, the hypothesis is a plausible inference from the premise, but not an entailment.the conclusion is that the hypothesis 'the government is passing a strict budget' is a plausible inference from the premise 'all governments are having problems with finances', but it is not an entailment."
6313,"Although estimates as to when this point will be reached vary depending on several assumptions, most analysts agree that it could occur within the decade; estimates range from the Congressional Budget Office's (CBO) January 2001 estimate of 2006 to the Office of Management and Budget's March 2001 estimate of 2008.",the Office of Management and Budget's estimate is correct,1,0,False,"step 1: in the premise, there are two estimates for when a certain point will be reached, one from the congressional budget office (cbo) and one from the office of management and budget (omb). both estimates fall within the same timeframe of the decade. step 2: the hypothesis asserts that the estimate from the office of management and budget is correct. to logically infer this from the premise, it would need to be established that this particular estimate is more reliable or accurate than the other estimate. however, the premise does not provide any information to support this. step 3: based on the information given in the premise, it is not possible to logically infer the hypothesis. the hypothesis goes beyond the information provided in the premise as it makes a definitive statement about which estimate is correct, while the premise only states that estimates vary and provides two possibilities."
6314,"The pleasant daze induced on the three-tiered travertine staircase, festooned in spring with pink azaleas, was celebrated by John Keats as a blissful cloud of summer indolence before he died here in 1821.","The three-tiered staircase is boring, and is barely worth mentioning.",0,0,True,"step 1: in the premise, we have a description of a three-tiered staircase adorned with pink azaleas, which is associated with a sense of pleasant daze and summer indolence as celebrated by john keats. this description implies that the staircase is a notable feature. common sense and historical context suggest that poets often find inspiration in beautiful environments and write about them. step 2: the hypothesis directly contradicts the premise as it states the opposite of the positive assessment of the staircase. the hypothesis implies that the staircase is insignificant and unworthy of mention. step 3: based on the information in the premise, the hypothesis cannot be logically inferred. in fact, the hypothesis contradicts the premise and is contrary to the given context."
6315,The Verve reformed in 2007 but again broke up by summer 2009.,The Verve reformed in 2008 but again broke up by summer 2009.,0,1,False,"step 1: in the premise, the verve is stated to have reformed in 2007 and broken up again by summer 2009. the hypothesis suggests a slightly different timeline, with the verve reforming in 2008 instead. both statements describe the band going through a reformation followed by a breakup within a year.step 2: the difference between the premise and hypothesis lies in the specific year of the verve's reformation. however, this difference does not contradict the information in the premise. reforming in 2008 is a reasonable assumption given that the band reformed and broke up again within that time frame.step 3: based on the given information and the logical consistency of the hypothesis, the hypothesis can be considered a reasonable inference from the premise. the premise does not exclude the possibility of the band reforming in 2008, and the hypothesis makes a logical progression from the premise based on the established timeline.step 4: in summary, the hypothesis 'the verve reformed in 2008 but again broke up by summer 2009' can be logically inferred from the premise 'the verve reformed in 2007 but again broke up by summer 2009'."
6316,He unwrapped the bundle and his eyes widened.,He teared up as he re-wrapped the bundle. ,0,0,True,"step 1: the premise describes an action where a person unwrapped a bundle and had a reaction with widened eyes. this reaction could be due to various reasons such as discovering a valuable item, a surprise, or an emotional response. the hypothesis suggests a different emotional response - tearing up - while wrapping the bundle back. there is no direct contradiction between the premise and hypothesis as both involve an action (unwrapping and re-wrapping) and a potential emotion.step 2: the hypothesis cannot be logically inferred from the premise as there is no information in the premise about the person tearing up or any indication of why he would re-wrap the bundle with such an emotional response. the hypothesis introduces a new element - the tearing up - which is not implied by the premise.step 3: based on the given information, the hypothesis is not logically entailed by the premise."
6317,"You willing to match Shiloh?""",Shiloh has super low prices no one can beat.,1,0,False,"step 1: in the premise, 'you willing to match shiloh?' is an invitation or challenge to match the prices offered by a business or entity named 'shiloh'. it does not provide any specific information about the prices or the reasons why the speaker is making this challenge. step 2: the hypothesis, 'shiloh has super low prices no one can beat', is a statement about the affordability of shiloh's prices, suggesting they are significantly cheaper than those of other businesses or entities. step 3: while the premise does not directly entail the hypothesis, it does not contradict it either. the hypothesis could be a possible explanation for why the speaker is extending the challenge to match shiloh's prices. however, the premise alone is not sufficient to logically infer the hypothesis. step 4: to make a definitive conclusion, we would need additional context or information to support the hypothesis. for instance, if we had data showing that shiloh's prices are consistently lower than those of their competitors, then the hypothesis could be logically inferred from the premise. in the absence of such evidence, the hypothesis is not entailed by the premise."
6318,Short walks to panoramic viewpoints should be a part of everyone's itinerary.,There are many picturesque locations to walk to.  ,1,1,True,"step 1: in the premise, it is suggested that visiting short walks to panoramic viewpoints is important for everyone's itinerary. this implies that there are indeed places worth visiting, which are often scenic or picturesque. step 2: the hypothesis states that there are many picturesque locations to walk to. this aligns with the information in the premise, as the presence of picturesque locations is a necessary condition for short walks to panoramic viewpoints as suggested in the premise. step 3: based on the logical relationship between the premise and hypothesis, and the common sense understanding that scenic or picturesque locations are what make short walks to panoramic viewpoints worth visiting, the hypothesis can be inferred from the premise."
6319,He probably destroys his own case.,He will probably clinch the victory in his case.,0,0,True,"step 1: the premise expresses a probability statement about the subject's destructive behavior. it does not provide any specific information about the 'case' or the context of the situation. step 2: the hypothesis also expresses a probability statement about the subject's ability to 'clinch the victory.' however, these statements are logically contradictory. the premise suggests that the subject is likely to destroy his case, while the hypothesis suggests that he is likely to secure victory. step 3: based on the logical analysis, the hypothesis cannot be inferred from the premise because they are contradictory statements."
6320,man that sounds really nice,"Well, that sounds really awful.",0,0,True,"step 1: in the premise, a man expresses a positive statement 'that sounds really nice'. this does not provide any specific information about the context or content of the nice sound. in the hypothesis, a person expresses an opposing negative statement 'that sounds really awful'. this statement also does not provide specific information about its context or relation to the premise. both sentences are subjective statements of opinion.step 2: the hypothesis cannot be logically inferred from the premise because there is no logical connection between a positive statement and a negative statement. the hypothesis contradicts the premise, but contradiction is not entailment.step 3: based on the logical reasoning, there is no entailment relationship between the premise and hypothesis."
6321,"We heard the rip and less than five seconds later, that piece fell.","We heard it rip before the piece fell, shattering.",1,0,False,"step 1: the premise describes an event where a piece rips and falls within five seconds. the ripping sound could potentially be the cause of the piece falling, but the sequence of events is not explicitly stated to be consecutive. step 2: the hypothesis suggests a different sequence of events, with the ripping sound happening before the piece falls, and the piece shattering as a result. this sequence of events is not directly contradictory to the premise, but it does introduce a missing step (shattering) that is not mentioned in the premise. step 3: the hypothesis cannot be logically inferred from the premise because the premise does not provide enough information to support the hypothesis's assumption of the ripping sound preceding the shattering. while it is possible for the ripping sound to precede the shattering, the premise does not make it clear that this is the case."
6322,Today it's just the summer heat that drives the Romans out on day-trips to the vineyards of the Alban hills and lakes.,The Alban hills and lakes have wonderful vineyards that the Romans visit in the summer months.,1,1,True,"step 1: in the premise, it is stated that the romans go on day-trips to the alban hills and lakes during the summer heat. this implies that there are attractive features in those locations that draw the romans out. the absence of any mention of other reasons for their visits, such as historical or recreational sites, supports the hypothesis that the primary appeal is the presence of vineyards.step 2: the hypothesis 'the alban hills and lakes have wonderful vineyards that the romans visit in the summer months' is consistent with the premise. it expands upon the information given in the premise by specifying the nature of the attractive features. the hypothesis is a logical conclusion based on the information in the premise.step 3: the hypothesis is entailed by the premise as it is a logical implication of the information presented in the premise."
6323,"Nevertheless, national saving beyond the amount necessary to replace depreciated capital goods is important for increasing the overall size of the capital stock and the nation's future productive capacity.",It is important to replace depreciated capital goods by national saving beyond the amount necessary and to improve our image.,1,1,True,"step 1. in the premise, national saving beyond the amount necessary to replace depreciated capital goods is stated as important for increasing the overall size of the capital stock and the nation's future productive capacity. this implies that saving more than what is needed for capital replacement leads to economic growth. step 2. the hypothesis suggests that national saving beyond the amount necessary is important not only for capital accumulation but also for improving the nation's image. while the premise does not provide any information about improving the nation's image, it does not contradict the hypothesis. step 3. the hypothesis can be seen as a logical extension of the premise, as the rationale for saving beyond the amount necessary to replace depreciated capital goods can apply to both economic growth and image improvement. therefore, the hypothesis can be inferred from the premise.step 4. it is important to note that the premise does not explicitly state that there is no saving beyond the amount necessary for capital replacement. the hypothesis goes further by suggesting its importance for image improvement. however, the premise does not contradict this, and common sense and logical reasoning suggest that the stated importance of national saving for economic growth can extend to other areas, such as image improvement.thus, the hypothesis is a reasonable inference from the premise."
6324,"Services are expanding, however, thanks to a $1 million public fund drive, that is $59,400 short of its goal.",The public fund drive included many types of fundraising.,1,1,True,"step 1: the premise states that the services are expanding but the public fund drive is $59,400 short of its goal. this implies that the public fund drive is an ongoing effort to raise funds for the expansion. step 2: the hypothesis does not contradict the premise and can be logically inferred as many types of fundraising could be included in a public fund drive. in fact, the need for a diverse range of fundraising efforts might explain the shortfall in the drive. step 3: based on the logical reasoning that a public fund drive can involve multiple types of fundraising and the absence of contradictory information, the hypothesis can be inferred from the premise."
6325,It has been a place of worship for both emperors and aristocrats for centuries.,It is a very peaceful location,1,1,True,"step 1: the premise indicates that the location has been significant for religious or ceremonial purposes for a long time, which is associated with peace and tranquility. this is based on the common understanding that places of worship are typically peaceful locations due to their historical and cultural significance. step 2: the hypothesis states that the location is very peaceful, which aligns with the information provided in the premise. the premise implies that the location has been a place of peace and calm, due to its historical usage by emperors and aristocrats. step 3: based on the logical connection between the historical significance of the location and the common understanding that such places are typically peaceful, the hypothesis can be inferred from the premise.step 4: additionally, there is no contradictory information in the premise or hypothesis that would prevent the logical inference.therefore, the hypothesis can be logically inferred from the premise."
6326,Minoans would walk down the corridor of processions past frescoed walls to reach the propylaia (sacred entranceway).,Minoans were forbidden from traveling to the propylaia.,0,0,True,"step 1: in the premise, it is stated that minoans would walk down the corridor past frescoed walls to reach the propylaia. this implies a routine or common occurrence. the term 'sacred entranceway' suggests a place of importance or reverence.step 2: the hypothesis, stating that minoans were forbidden from traveling to the propylaia, directly contradicts the information given in the premise. there's no indication in the premise that the minoans were not allowed to enter the propylaia.step 3: based on the given information, the hypothesis cannot be logically inferred from the premise, as it contradicts it."
6327,as as perhaps they are,I'm sure that it's true,1,0,False,"step 1. the premise is a fragmented sentence and does not provide clear key information or relationships. it could be interpreted as a statement of uncertainty or doubt about the truth of something, but it does not provide enough context to determine what that something is. the hypothesis is a statement of certainty about something being true, but without a clear premise to relate it to, it cannot be logically inferred. step 2. there is no logical relationship between the premise and the hypothesis, as the premise does not provide enough information to infer the hypothesis. step 3. based on the lack of clear information and logical connection between the premise and hypothesis, the hypothesis cannot be inferred from the premise."
6328,"Oh, Julius, isn't he just a duck?",Isn't he just a fish?,0,1,False,"step 1: in the premise, julius is described as a 'duck'. a duck is a waterbird that is a common type of bird, but it is also a type of fish because it is part of the taxonomic class 'pisces'. however, in the premise, julius is called a 'duck' in a colloquial sense, implying a bird. no contradiction exists between 'duck' as a bird and 'duck' as a type of fish. however, the premise does not imply or suggest that julius is a fish in the current context. step 2: the hypothesis, 'isn't he just a fish?' suggests a different meaning of 'fish' than in the premise. in the hypothesis, 'fish' is a general term for any aquatic organism. thus, the hypothesis can be logically inferred from the premise as both julius being a duck (bird) and julius being a fish (aquatic organism) are not mutually exclusive. step 3: based on the logical reasoning and lack of contradictory facts, the hypothesis can be inferred from the premise, but it might not capture the intended meaning of the original statement in the premise."
6329,"Particularly over the past decade, there has been greater availability of plate steel for FGD projects due to the global sourcing of carbon steel.",Plate steel for FGD projects is much harder to come by.,0,0,True,"step 1: the premise indicates an increase in the availability of plate steel for fgd projects over the past decade due to global sourcing of carbon steel. this implies that plate steel is not a scarce resource in this context. step 2: the hypothesis suggests that plate steel for fgd projects is much harder to come by, which directly contradicts the information in the premise. step 3: based on the contradictory nature of the hypothesis with the premise, the hypothesis cannot be logically inferred from the premise."
6330,"And the idea is a good one, yes.",Everyone feels the idea is good.,1,0,False,"step 1: in the premise, the speaker expresses their approval of an idea, stating 'and the idea is a good one, yes'. this implies that the speaker has a positive opinion of the idea. step 2: the hypothesis suggests that 'everyone' shares the same positive opinion as the speaker regarding the idea. while the premise only provides information about the speaker's perspective, it does not provide enough information to infer that everyone actually holds the same opinion. therefore, 'everyone feels the idea is good' cannot be logically inferred from 'and the idea is a good one, yes'. step 3: based on the given information, the hypothesis is not entailed by the premise."
6332,"This tax preference allows state and local governments to borrow at lower rates to build highways, schools, mass transit facilities, and water systems.",This will tax preference will help our communities develop faster.,1,1,True,"step 1: the premise states that a tax preference enables state and local governments to borrow money at lower interest rates. this, in turn, makes it less expensive for governments to fund infrastructure projects such as highways, schools, mass transit facilities, and water systems. step 2: the hypothesis suggests that the existence of this tax preference will 'help our communities develop faster'. the term 'develop faster' can be broken down to mean that communities will grow and improve more quickly. a common sense understanding of the situation indicates that having access to lower borrowing rates allows governments to invest more resources into infrastructure projects, which can lead to faster development of communities. step 3: based on the logical connection between the premise and hypothesis, and the common-sense understanding of the situation, the hypothesis can be inferred from the premise.step 4: an additional logical principle that supports the inference is the principle of sufficient reason. this principle states that for any fact or event, there must be a sufficient reason for its existence. the existence of this tax preference (premise) has a logical reason - it enables governments to borrow money more cheaply, which can lead to faster community development (hypothesis).therefore, the hypothesis is a logical inference from the premise."
6334,How can we measure our performance?,How do we evaluate our performance in last nights game? ,1,1,True,"step 1: in the premise, 'we' and 'our performance' are not explicitly defined, but the context suggests a general question about measuring performance. the hypothesis also asks about evaluating performance, but it is specific to 'last night's game'. step 2: the hypothesis can be logically inferred from the premise, as 'last night's game' is a specific instance of 'performance' that can be measured and evaluated. step 3: while both sentences are about measuring or evaluating performance, the hypothesis is more specific and refers to a particular instance of performance. however, the specificity does not contradict the general premise, but rather provides additional context. thus, the hypothesis is a logical consequence of the premise."
6335,Choose your own fish from the display and find out how much it will cost before having it cooked.,"You can pick your own fish out of a large selection, learn the price, then have it cooked.",1,1,True,"step 1: in the premise, the scenario is described as a process where the person chooses a fish, learns the cost, and then has it cooked. this implies that the selection, learning the price, and having it cooked are sequential steps. step 2: the hypothesis states that a person can pick their own fish, learn the price, and then have it cooked. this is exactly the same process as described in the premise. therefore, the hypothesis is a specific case of the premise and can be logically inferred. step 3: based on the logical reasoning that the hypothesis is a specific instance of the premise, the hypothesis is entailed by the premise."
6336,well it's probably on its way up there it was heading north,It started going west before heading back east.,0,0,True,"step 1: the premise describes an object moving north. no specific information is given about any changes in direction before or after the northward movement. common sense and logical principles do not allow us to infer a change in direction based on the given information alone. step 2: the hypothesis describes a different direction, 'west,' followed by another direction, 'back east.' however, the premise does not provide any basis for inferring this sequence of directions. step 3: based on the lack of information provided in the premise that would support the hypothesis, it cannot be logically inferred from the premise."
6337,"Outside, set in manicured gardens, are the remains of the Abbey of Holyrood.",The remains have been preserved as a site for pilgrims to visit.,1,1,True,"step 1: the premise describes the location of the abbey of holyrood, specifically that it is set in manicured gardens. manicured gardens suggest care and maintenance, which is typically associated with sites for pilgrims. there is no information in the premise that contradicts the hypothesis. step 2: the hypothesis states that the remains have been preserved for pilgrims to visit. this can be inferred from the premise as the manicured gardens may serve as an indication that efforts have been made to preserve the site for a particular purpose. step 3: based on the logical reasoning and lack of contradictory information, the hypothesis can be inferred from the premise."
6338,"Shortly beyond the reporting period in May 2001, the Office of Program Performance held a special telephonic conference for 2002 grant applicants involved in mergers/consolidations.",The Office of Program Performance organized a special web presentation.,0,0,True,"step 1: in the premise, the office of program performance held a special telephonic conference for 2002 grant applicants. this implies an organized event intended for communication. step 2: the hypothesis suggests a special web presentation. while there is no direct mention of a web presentation in the premise, organizing a web presentation is a common method for communication in today's context, especially in the context of grant applicants and government offices. step 3: there is no contradictory information in the premise that would prevent the hypothesis from being true. however, there is no explicit mention of a web presentation in the premise. thus, while the hypothesis is plausible, it is not strictly logically inferred from the premise. step 4: considering the context and the common practices, the hypothesis can be seen as a reasonable extension or alternative to the premise. step 5: given the information provided, the hypothesis cannot be definitively determined to be entailed by the premise, and it may represent an extension or alternative rather than a strict logical inference."
6339,"A classroom full of men, with the teacher up front.",A bunch of men are in class.,1,1,True,"step 1: in the premise, a classroom is described as being full of men, which implies a group of men in a classroom setting. the presence of a teacher does not contradict the hypothesis. step 2: the hypothesis 'a bunch of men are in class' can be logically inferred from the premise, as it follows directly from the description of the classroom being full of men. step 3: given the logical connection between the premise and hypothesis, and the consistency with common sense, the hypothesis is entailed by the premise."
6340,well our our kids are a little older actually we got a a seventeen year old and a and a fourteen year old but but we still wind up i still i like fast food reasonably well,Our teenage kids like to eat at McDonald's.,1,1,True,"step 1. in the premise, the parents mention having teenage children, specifically a seventeen-year-old and a fourteen-year-old. they also state that they still enjoy fast food reasonably well. this information does not necessarily provide any direct indication about their kids' food preferences. however, it's a common observation that teenagers often enjoy fast food. step 2. the hypothesis 'our teenage kids like to eat at mcdonald's' can be inferred from the premise since having teenage children and enjoying fast food reasonably well are not contradictory to the hypothesis. in fact, it's a reasonable assumption based on common observations about teenagers' food preferences. step 3. based on the logical reasoning, common sense, and lack of contradictory information, the hypothesis is a reasonable inference from the premise."
6341,Is all that clear?,We're clear.,0,1,False,"step 1: in the premise, 'is all that clear?' is a question asking for confirmation of understanding. it does not provide any specific information about the topic of conversation. in the hypothesis, 'we're clear' is a statement indicating that the understanding is mutual.step 2: the hypothesis can be inferred from the premise based on the context. the question in the premise implies a need for confirmation that all parties involved are on the same page, while the hypothesis states that they are. this mutual understanding is a logical consequence of the premise.step 3: based on the logical relationship between the premise and hypothesis, and the absence of contradictory information, the hypothesis can be inferred from the premise."
6342,"According to conspiracy rules, all politicians were supposed to receive credit (new respect) for turning more liberal.",Politicians are shunned for becoming liberal. ,0,0,True,"step 1: in the premise, it is stated that, according to conspiracy rules, politicians were supposed to receive credit for turning more liberal. this suggests a general expectation or presumption that liberal politicians would be respected or regarded positively. step 2: the hypothesis, however, states that politicians are shunned for becoming liberal, which is in direct contradiction to the premise. the hypothesis suggests that the opposite of what is expected or presumed in the premise is true. step 3: based on the logical analysis, the hypothesis cannot be inferred from the premise as they contradict each other.step 4: it is important to note that while the premise is a statement about a rule or expectation, it does not necessarily reflect the actual reality. the hypothesis, on the other hand, may or may not reflect the actual reality. a conspiracy theory is not a logical or factual argument, but rather a belief or suspicion that is not based on evidence. in this case, the premise and hypothesis represent conflicting conspiracy theories or beliefs about the same subject, and neither can be logically inferred from the other."
6343,"For example, the organizations that had professional and administrative staffs said that it was difficult to find and retain employees with the level of skills and foresight that would contribute to the organization's mission.",the organizations that had professional and administrative staffs said that it was difficult to find and retain employees who loved eating meat,1,0,False,"step 1. in the premise, we have a statement about the difficulty experienced by certain organizations in finding and retaining employees with specific skills and foresight. the hypothesis suggests a different set of employees, those who love eating meat, and the same difficulty being experienced. however, there is no logical connection or obvious commonality between the employees mentioned in the premise and those in the hypothesis. no facts are contradicted, but there is no clear basis for logical inference. step 2. the hypothesis 'the organizations that had professional and administrative staffs said that it was difficult to find and retain employees who loved eating meat' is not logically entailed by the premise 'for example, the organizations that had professional and administrative staffs said that it was difficult to find and retain employees with the level of skills and foresight that would contribute to the organization's mission'. the hypothesis introduces a new and unrelated condition that is not implied by the premise. step 3. based on the information given, the hypothesis is not logically inferable from the premise."
6344,"Upon careful consideration of the findings of fact, the language and purposes of the statute and the legislative history, the Commission has determined that none of these formulations fully responds to the purposes of the statute or the intent of Congress.",The Commission wants more formulations to be done to meet the intent of Congress.,1,1,True,"step 1: the premise indicates that the commission has determined that none of the existing formulations fully respond to the purposes of the statute or the intent of congress. this suggests that the commission is looking for more adequate formulations to meet the legislative intent.step 2: the hypothesis, 'the commission wants more formulations to be done', can be logically inferred from the premise because the premise implies a need for more formulations to meet the intent of the statute, and the commission is the entity responsible for creating these formulations.step 3: based on the logical reasoning, the hypothesis can be inferred from the premise."
6345,"We see a worker clocking in while the narrator points to 10 million new jobs and, as the spot cuts to a Kennedyesque Clinton with children, it concludes with the phrase a better future.",They wanted to give people that were unemployed a glimmer of hope.,1,1,True,"step 1: in the premise, we have a scene where a worker is clocking in, and there's a narration about 10 million new jobs and the promise of a better future. the context implies that the new jobs are significant and likely to reduce unemployment. step 2: the hypothesis is about giving unemployed people 'a glimmer of hope.' this is related to the premise as giving hope to the unemployed is a natural response to the announcement of new jobs. step 3: the hypothesis can be inferred from the premise as it is a logical and expected outcome of the new jobs being announced. the premise sets up the context and the hypothesis describes the emotional and motivational effect of the new jobs. therefore, the hypothesis is a reasonable inference from the premise."
6346,Two girls are walking down the street looking at items in the store windows.,Two friends are walking together to there house and decided to skip,0,0,True,"step 1: the premise describes two girls walking down the street, looking at items in store windows. this does not inherently imply any specific relationship between the girls or their intentions. the girls could be strangers, acquaintances, or friends. the action of looking at store windows is a common behavior.step 2: the hypothesis describes two friends walking together to their house and deciding to skip. this implies a relationship of friendship between the two individuals and an intention to go to their house. however, there is no information in the premise that directly supports or contradicts this hypothesis.step 3: based on the given information, the hypothesis cannot be logically inferred from the premise as the premise does not provide sufficient evidence to support the relationship of friendship or the intention to go to a house.step 4: it is also important to note that the absence of evidence does not prove the absence of a fact. the hypothesis could still be true, but it cannot be determined with the given information alone."
6347,So many seemingly contrary and opposing factors combine to make it unique.,This does not exist anywhere else on earth.,1,0,False,"step 1: the premise describes a situation where various opposing factors come together to make something unique. it does not provide any specific information about the location or uniqueness of this entity or phenomenon. common sense and logical principles do not necessarily dictate that a unique entity or phenomenon must be the only one of its kind on earth. step 2: the hypothesis makes a stronger claim than the premise by stating that this unique entity or phenomenon does not exist anywhere else on earth. however, based on the information given in the premise, there is no logical or factual basis to infer that this is the case. step 3: therefore, the hypothesis cannot be logically inferred from the premise."
6348,"The brawny Neeson is a calamity as Wilde, says New York's John Simon.",Neeson is not at all brawny.,0,0,True,"step 1: in the premise, john simon expresses his opinion that liam neeson is a calamity as wilde and that he is brawny. opinions are subjective and do not necessarily reflect factual truth. however, the term 'brawny' is an objective descriptive term, and if it has been used in the premise, it implies a certain level of physical strength or size.step 2: the hypothesis proposes the exact opposite of the premise, stating that neeson is not brawny. this contradicts the premise.step 3: based on the information provided, the hypothesis cannot be logically inferred from the premise as they are contradictory statements.step 4: it's essential to note that opinions and facts are different, and an opinion in the premise does not make a factual statement in the hypothesis."
6349,policies and procedures for executive agenciesAcquisition governmentwide.,These practices are unregulated with the agencies.,0,0,True,"step 1: the premise refers to policies and procedures for executive agencies regarding acquisition (buying goods, services, or construction). it does not provide any explicit information about regulation or lack thereof. step 2: the hypothesis suggests that these practices are 'unregulated' within the agencies. while the premise does not state that these practices are regulated, it also does not state that they are unregulated. it is important to note that the absence of information is not the same as the presence of a contradiction. step 3: based on the given information, it is not possible to logically infer the hypothesis from the premise. the premise does not provide sufficient information to determine whether or not the practices are regulated."
6351,yeah those those are those are always the i i think those are more fun than major league games sometimes,Most people prefer major leagues games to those,1,0,False,"step 1: in the premise, the speaker is expressing their personal preference for 'those' (an unspecified type of games) over major league games. step 2: the hypothesis states a general preference for major league games by 'most people'. these two statements are in direct contradiction. it is important to note that preferences can vary greatly among individuals, and the premise only represents the speaker's preference. step 3: based on the logical negation between the premise and hypothesis, the hypothesis cannot be logically inferred from the premise."
6352,and it just depends on how bad that person is,"It depends on the condition of the person, what kind of nursing home they go to.",1,0,False,"step 1: in the premise, the dependency on 'how bad that person is' suggests a variable factor. the premise does not provide any specific information about the person's condition or the type of nursing home. step 2: the hypothesis introduces a new factor, 'the condition of the person' and 'the type of nursing home they go to'. while these factors are related to the premise (as 'how bad that person is' could be influenced by their health or the quality of care they receive), they are not directly inferred from the premise. step 3: based on the given information, it is not possible to logically infer the hypothesis from the premise. the hypothesis introduces new information that is not explicitly stated or implied in the premise."
6353,and uh as a matter of fact he's a draft dodger,He avoided the military draft of 1943 when the need was highest.,1,1,True,"step 1: in the premise, it is stated that 'he' is a draft dodger. a draft dodger is someone who intentionally avoids military service, usually during times of war. the year is not explicitly mentioned in the premise, but the context suggests that it might be referring to a particular draft. the hypothesis provides a specific year (1943) and states that 'he' avoided the draft 'when the need was highest'. this is consistent with the premise's definition of a draft dodger.step 2: the hypothesis can be logically inferred from the premise since the premise already implies that 'he' intentionally avoided military service, which is the core meaning of the hypothesis. the hypothesis adds the detail about the specific draft in 1943, but it does not contradict the premise.step 3: based on the logical connection between the premise and hypothesis, the hypothesis can be considered to be logically inferred from the premise as it does not introduce any contradictory or incorrect information."
6354,but i think let's see the teams that were there last year were see somebody from California i don't even know who won the pennant last year,I'm not really interested in last year's teams because I know who the winner was and that's all that counts.,0,0,True,"step 1: in the premise, the speaker is discussing their observation of last year's baseball teams and their lack of knowledge about the pennant winner. step 2: the hypothesis expresses the speaker's indifference towards last year's teams, focusing only on the winner. while both the premise and hypothesis are about last year's baseball teams, there is no direct logical relationship between them. the speaker's lack of interest in the teams, as stated in the hypothesis, is not logically inferred from their lack of knowledge about the winner, as stated in the premise. step 3: based on the given information, the hypothesis cannot be logically inferred from the premise."
6355,and then put that back in the saucepan,You won't use the saucepan again,0,0,True,"step 1: in the premise, the saucepan is mentioned, and an action is taken to remove its content and put it back in the saucepan. this does not inherently indicate that the saucepan will not be used again. however, the premise does not provide any information about the reason for putting the content back in the saucepan or any further actions that might be taken with the saucepan.step 2: the hypothesis makes a claim about a future action, not directly related to the information provided in the premise. the hypothesis cannot be logically inferred from the premise as it goes beyond the information given.step 3: based on the logical reasoning, the hypothesis is not entailed by the premise."
6356,and that's where it costs money,the whole process is free,0,0,True,"step 1: the premise describes a situation where something costs money. this implies an exchange or payment of some sort. there is no specific information about what the 'whole process' refers to, but the context suggests an activity or series of actions that incur a financial cost.step 2: the hypothesis states that the 'whole process' is free, which contradicts the premise. if an activity is free, it does not involve any cost or payment. if we assume that the 'whole process' mentioned in the hypothesis refers to the same process as in the premise, then the hypothesis cannot be logically inferred from the premise.step 3: based on the given information, the hypothesis cannot be inferred from the premise as it contradicts the premise's key information."
6358,Michael Kinsley helps you translate the favored by politicians unwilling to take a stand on the Kosovo bombings.,Politicians are scared of the backlash from taking a stand on the bombings.,1,1,True,"step 1: the premise suggests that michael kinsley helps politicians in their unwillingness to take a stand on the kosovo bombings. this implies that the politicians have a fear or apprehension that prevents them from taking a clear position. step 2: the hypothesis states that politicians are scared of the backlash from taking a stand on the bombings. this fear is a logical explanation for why they are unwilling to take a stand as described in the premise. step 3: based on the logical connection between the premise and hypothesis, and the lack of contradictory information, the hypothesis can be inferred from the premise."
6359,Thank you.',"That was nice of you, we appreciate it.",1,1,True,"step 1: in the premise, the speaker is expressing gratitude. gratitude is a response to receiving a kindness or favor. in this context, the speaker is acknowledging a favor or kindness that has been extended to them.step 2: the hypothesis expresses appreciation and acknowledgement in response to a kindness or favor. this is the same meaning conveyed in the premise.step 3: based on the semantic similarity between the two statements and the lack of contradictory information, the hypothesis can be inferred from the premise.step 4: it is important to note that this inference is based on the assumption that the speaker in the hypothesis is referring to the same situation as the speaker in the premise."
6360,uh it's no wonder ticket prices are so high,I cannot afford to buy a ticket this season.,1,0,False,"step 1: the premise expresses a general observation that ticket prices are high. it does not provide any information about the speaker's financial situation or their ability to buy a ticket.step 2: the hypothesis asserts that the speaker cannot afford a ticket this season. this statement is not logically entailed by the premise. the premise only discusses the high cost of tickets in general, it does not directly relate to the speaker's financial situation.step 3: the hypothesis makes an assumption about the speaker's financial situation based on the premise, but this assumption is not justified by the information given in the premise.label: 0"
6361,"To hold its senior executives accountable for improved products and services, VBA set targets for executives to achieve, such as the abandoned telephone call rate-the percentage of callers who get through to VBA, but are put on hold and hang up before being connected to an employee.",Senior executives are not helpful in improving what the agency does.,0,0,True,"step 1: in the premise, vba holds senior executives accountable for improved products and services by setting targets. one such target is the abandoned telephone call rate. this indicates that the senior executives' performance is being evaluated based on their ability to reduce the percentage of callers who hang up before being connected to an employee. it implies that the senior executives have some level of control over this metric. step 2: the hypothesis, 'senior executives are not helpful in improving what the agency does,' is not directly related to the information in the premise. the premise only indicates that senior executives are being held accountable for improving certain metrics. it does not explicitly state that they are helpful or not in improving what the agency does. step 3: based on the information provided, it is not possible to logically infer the hypothesis from the premise. the hypothesis makes a broader claim about the senior executives' role in improving the agency as a whole, while the premise only provides specific information about one metric and the executive's accountability for it."
6362,uh-huh uh-huh well it's going to be interesting in the next few years to see what happens because there's quite a strong democratic um um,It's going to be boring for the next few years. ,0,0,True,"step 1. in the premise, the speaker expresses anticipation and interest in what is going to happen in the next few years due to a strong democratic presence. this implies a sense of excitement or uncertainty.step 2. the hypothesis, on the other hand, expresses the opposite sentiment - it's going to be boring. this is a contradiction to the premise as the two cannot logically coexist. the premise suggests a situation full of interest, whereas the hypothesis suggests a lack thereof.step 3. based on the logical contradiction between the premise and hypothesis, it's clear that the hypothesis cannot be inferred from the premise. the premise does not provide enough information for the hypothesis to be a logical consequence.step 4. furthermore, common sense and real-world knowledge tell us that the strength of a political party does not necessarily determine the level of interest or excitement in the political landscape. therefore, the hypothesis being 'boring' is not a logical nor reasonable inference from the premise."
6363,"Two people, one in light jeans and a striped shirt, are playing pool.",The people play pool,1,1,True,"step 1: in the premise, two people are identified, one wearing light jeans and a striped shirt. the action they are performing is playing pool. this is a known factual situation, where people can indeed wear certain clothing while engaging in activities like playing pool. there are no logical contradictions or inconsistencies in the premise.step 2: the hypothesis simply states that the people are playing pool. this is exactly what the premise states, so the hypothesis follows logically from the premise.step 3: based on the logical reasoning and factual consistency of the information provided, the hypothesis is entailed by the premise."
6364,I have the highest regard for their judicial system.,I would run a judicial system similar to how they do.,1,0,False,"step 1: in the premise, the speaker expresses a high level of respect for another entity's (implicitly a country's) judicial system. step 2: the hypothesis suggests that the speaker would implement a similar judicial system. this inference is based on the assumption that the speaker's positive regard for the system implies that they admire its principles and practices. step 3: while there is a logical connection between the premise and hypothesis, there could be exceptions. the speaker's respect for the system might not necessarily mean they would replicate it exactly. other factors, such as resources, cultural context, and personal beliefs, could influence their decision. the hypothesis, therefore, cannot be definitively inferred from the premise alone. step 4: it is important to consider potential counterexamples and edge cases when making logical inferences. in this scenario, the speaker's intentions and the specific context of their statement should be taken into account to accurately evaluate the logical relationship between the premise and hypothesis."
6365,"This is entirely and totally wrong, and anyone paying any attention to what's going on with Java would know this.",There is nothing wrong and everyone knows about Java.,0,0,True,"step 1: the premise expresses a strong statement that there is something entirely and totally wrong with java, and that anyone who is paying attention would know this. it implies a clear understanding of the java programming language and a recognition of specific issues or mistakes.step 2: the hypothesis, on the other hand, states that there is nothing wrong with java and that everyone knows about it. this statement directly contradicts the premise, as it asserts the opposite of what was expressed in the premise.step 3: based on the given information, the hypothesis cannot be logically inferred from the premise, as they are in direct contradiction with each other. the hypothesis implies a state of affairs that is not supported by the premise.step 4: in order for the hypothesis to be logically inferred from the premise, there would need to be evidence or information presented that shows the premise to be incorrect and that the hypothesis is, in fact, true. in the absence of such information, the hypothesis is not entailed by the premise."
6366,hi uh as a matter of fact this past weekend since we had a long weekend i uh took on a painting project in my bathroom and i had wallpaper up i had to completely strip the wallpaper off and then spackle holes and then paint that and it took me all weekend because uh the wallpaper getting it off i had to wet the walls down and that had to dry and then the spackling had to dry a day and then the painting took another day,The spackling dried out in less than an hour. ,0,0,True,"step 1: the premise describes a home improvement project where the speaker had to remove wallpaper, prepare the walls with spackling, and then paint. the process involved getting the walls wet to help remove the wallpaper, waiting for the walls to dry before applying spackling, and waiting for the spackling to dry before painting. common sense and the information provided in the premise suggest that the spackling took a significant amount of time to dry, as it was not explicitly stated that it dried quickly.step 2: the hypothesis contradicts the premise, as it suggests that the spackling dried out in less than an hour. this is not logically implied by the premise and goes against the common-sense understanding of the spackling drying process.step 3: based on the logical analysis and the contradiction between the premise and hypothesis, the hypothesis is not entailed by the premise. in fact, the hypothesis directly contradicts the premise."
6367,Both programs are recipients of partnership grants to run projects to help Spanish-speaking pro per clients in their respective county courthouses.,Most of the clients they get speak spanish.,1,1,True,"step 1: the premise states that both programs are recipients of partnership grants and they are running projects to help spanish-speaking pro per clients in their respective county courthouses. this information implies that the programs cater to the needs of the spanish-speaking population in the courthouses.step 2: the hypothesis suggests that most of the clients they get speak spanish. given the information in the premise, this hypothesis is a reasonable inference as the programs are designed to help spanish-speaking clients. if the majority of the clients were not spanish-speaking, it would be an unexpected outcome and contradict the stated purpose of the programs.step 3: based on the logical connection between the premise and hypothesis, the hypothesis can be inferred from the premise."
6368,"Quality Four, a jazz quartet founded by saxophonist Paul Howard, was formed in 1924 to play at Quality Cafe.","Quality Four, a jazz quartet founded by saxophonist Paul Howard and featuring young vibraphonist Lionel Hampton, was formed in 1924 to play at Quality Cafe.",1,1,True,"step 1: in the premise, we have the formation of a jazz quartet named quality four, founded by saxophonist paul howard, in 1924 for playing at quality cafe. this information provides the context and key elements of the quartet. in the hypothesis, the same quartet, quality four, is mentioned, with the addition of young vibraphonist lionel hampton as a member. the year and the location of formation are identical in both sentences.step 2: the hypothesis does not contradict the premise in any way. in fact, it adds information about the membership of the quartet without changing the original context. the formation year, the founding member, and the location remain the same.step 3: given the identical context, the addition of lionel hampton as a member in the hypothesis can be logically inferred from the premise since it does not contradict the given information and extends the details of the quartet's formation. it is common knowledge that band members can change over time, and the presence of lionel hampton in this jazz quartet is a well-documented fact.step 4: based on the logical reasoning, common sense, and factual consistency, the hypothesis is entailed by the premise."
6369,Computer-processed data can vary in form-from electronic files to tables in published reports.,Electronic files are the most secure way to store data.,1,0,False,"step 1: in the premise, it is stated that computer-processed data can exist in various forms, including electronic files and tables in published reports. the security of data storage is not directly mentioned in the premise. however, it is a common concern when dealing with data.step 2: the hypothesis claims that electronic files are the most secure way to store data. this statement does not logically follow from the premise. the premise only mentions that computer-processed data can take the form of electronic files. it does not make any claims about the security of electronic files compared to other forms of data storage.step 3: the hypothesis is not logically entailed by the premise. while electronic files may offer certain security advantages, such as password protection and encryption, they can also be vulnerable to threats like malware, hacking, and power outages. the security of data storage ultimately depends on various factors, including the specific security measures implemented.step 4: it is essential not to confuse logical entailment with plausibility or common sense. while it might be plausible or common sense to assume that electronic files are more secure than other forms of data storage, this assumption is not logically entailed by the given premise."
6370,yeah Sierra hasn't shown that kind of maturity yet,Sierra may eventually show that maturity level,1,1,True,"step 1: in the premise, it is stated that sierra hasn't shown maturity yet. this suggests that there is a current lack of maturity in sierra's behavior. however, it does not exclude the possibility that she could develop this maturity in the future. step 2: the hypothesis posits that sierra may eventually show maturity. this is a reasonable inference from the premise, as the absence of maturity now does not necessarily mean that it will never manifest. the hypothesis does not contradict the premise and is consistent with it. step 3: based on the logical reasoning and common sense, the hypothesis can be inferred from the premise as it suggests a potential future development of a trait that is currently absent."
6371,"As a result of the damage caused by Hazel, its name was retired from use for North Atlantic hurricanes.","As a result of the high death toll and the damage caused by Hazel, its name was retired from use for North Atlantic hurricanes.",1,1,True,"step 1: in the premise, 'as a result of the damage caused by hazel' implies that the hurricane caused significant harm. the second sentence, 'as a result of the high death toll and the damage caused by hazel', adds the specific reason for the retirement of the name - the high human toll and the extensive damage caused by the hurricane. both sentences describe the same event from slightly different angles. they are logically equivalent, as the high death toll and massive damage are direct consequences of the damage caused by the hurricane. step 2: the hypothesis is logically equivalent to the premise, as the hypothesis infers the retirement of the name 'hazel' based on the same cause - the significant damage and high death toll. step 3: based on the logical equivalence of the premise and hypothesis, the hypothesis is entailed by the premise."
6373,I warned her. ,I didn't warn her. ,0,0,True,"step 1: the premise indicates that you performed an action (warned) towards a certain person. the hypothesis suggests the opposite of this action (didn't warn). step 2: the hypothesis contradicts the premise as it negates the action stated in the premise. step 3: based on the information provided, there is no logical entailment between the premise and the hypothesis. logically speaking, a warning and not warning are mutually exclusive events, neither can be inferred from the other."
6374, Federal Communications  Unlicensed NII Devices in the 5 GHz Frequency Range,The unlicensed devices were hazardous.,1,0,False,"step 1: in the premise, it is stated that 'federal communications unlicensed nii devices in the 5 ghz frequency range' are present. this information does not inherently imply any hazardous properties or conditions. however, the term 'unlicensed' might suggest a lack of regulatory oversight, and the 5 ghz frequency range is used by various wireless technologies. however, no specific information is given in the premise about the safety of these devices or the conditions under which they are being used.step 2: the hypothesis, 'the unlicensed devices were hazardous,' makes a definitive statement about the safety of the unlicensed devices, implying a risk or danger. this statement is not logically entailed by the premise, as there is no direct evidence or information provided in the premise that supports this claim.step 3: based on the logical analysis, the hypothesis cannot be inferred from the premise. while the premise does mention the presence and frequency range of the unlicensed devices, it does not provide sufficient information to logically conclude that they are hazardous."
6375,"She went back to her plastic surgeon, and after he fixed them she admired his handiwork so much that a romance between the two might have ensued, says the publication.",A woman had an intimate relationship with her optometrist after he checked her eyes.,0,0,True,"step 1: in the premise, a woman (she) went back to a professional, identified as a plastic surgeon, for a reason that led to a potential romantic connection. the hypothesis describes a woman having an intimate relationship with a different professional, an optometrist. step 2: while there is no direct connection between the professions mentioned in the premise and hypothesis, the scenario of a woman developing a romantic interest in a professional after receiving services from them is not far-fetched. this is a common theme in various stories and anecdotes. step 3: however, the hypothesis cannot be logically inferred from the premise because the professionals involved are different (plastic surgeon vs. optometrist). the premise does not provide enough information to directly infer that the woman's optometrist was the one she developed an intimate relationship with. step 4: it is important to note that the premise and hypothesis describe different scenarios with different professionals, even though there may be some similarities in terms of a romantic connection developing after a professional service. step 5: based on the given information, there is no entailment between the premise and hypothesis."
6376,Huge percentages of the population are priced out of the legal system.,They are able to help 100% of the people that need it.,0,0,True,"step 1: in the premise, it is stated that a huge percentage of the population cannot afford the legal system. this implies that there are many people who are unable to receive legal assistance or representation due to financial constraints.step 2: the hypothesis, however, asserts that they (implicitly referring to the legal system) are able to help 100% of the people that need it. this directly contradicts the information provided in the premise, suggesting that the hypothesis is not logically inferable from it.step 3: based on the given premise and hypothesis, there is no logical entailment relationship between them. the hypothesis cannot be logically derived from the premise."
6377,"The latest news is that, after four days of negotiations, the two sides failed to agree on when the Irish Republican Army must disarm.",There might never be an agreement on when the IRA must disarm.,1,0,False,"step 1: in the premise, it is stated that after four days of negotiations, both sides have failed to reach an agreement on the disarmament of the irish republican army. this implies that the issue of when the ira should disarm is a contentious one.step 2: the hypothesis suggests that there might never be an agreement on this issue. this is a possible outcome based on the current state of negotiations described in the premise. if negotiations have failed after four days, it's reasonable to consider that they might not succeed in the future.step 3: given the information in the premise and the logical connection between the premise and hypothesis, it can be concluded that the hypothesis is a reasonable and logical possibility based on the current situation.step 4: the hypothesis does not necessarily have to be a certain truth, but it can be logically inferred as a potential outcome from the premise."
6378,The Grand Slam Breakfast just never took off.,The Grand Slam Lunch never grew popular.,1,0,False,"step 1: the premise indicates that the grand slam breakfast did not gain popularity. this suggests that the demand for this dish was low. step 2: the hypothesis suggests that the grand slam lunch, which is a different meal than the grand slam breakfast, did not grow popular. since there is no direct connection mentioned between the grand slam breakfast and grand slam lunch in either the premise or hypothesis, we cannot logically infer that the unsusccess of one meal implies the unsccess of another meal. step 3: based on the given information, the hypothesis is not logically entailed by the premise."
6379,"and was co-produced by Children's Television Workshop (""now known as"" Sesame Workshop) but the partnership broke up.","and was co-produced by Children's Television Workshop (""now known as"" Sesame Workshop) but the partnership broke behind.",0,0,True,"step 1: both the premise and hypothesis mention that sesame street was co-produced by children's television workshop (now known as sesame workshop). the premise adds that the partnership broke up. step 2: the hypothesis introduces a new location 'behind' which doesn't exist in the context of the premise. there's no logical connection between the premise and the hypothesis regarding the 'behind' part. however, both sentences agree on the past co-production by sesame workshop. step 3: based on the given information, the hypothesis cannot be logically inferred from the premise as the premise does not provide any indication of a partnership breaking up 'behind' anything."
6380,"Also, the Secretary of Health and Human Services has certified that the final rule will not have a significant impact on the operations of a substantial number of rural hospitals, as required by section 1102(b) of the Social Security Act (42 U.S.C.","The secretary says the final rule won't impact rural hospitals, whose budgets are already stretched too far.",1,0,False,"step 1: in the premise, the secretary of health and human services (hhs) is stating that the final rule will not have a significant impact on the operations of a substantial number of rural hospitals, as required by law. this certification implies that the hhs has assessed the rule's potential effects and determined that they will not severely disrupt the financial situation or operations of these hospitals.step 2: in the hypothesis, it is stated that the budgets of these rural hospitals are already stretched too far. this information does not contradict the premise, as the premise only addresses the impact of the final rule, not the current financial situation of the rural hospitals.step 3: based on the given information, the hypothesis does not logically follow from the premise. the premise certifies that the final rule will not significantly impact the rural hospitals, while the hypothesis states that their budgets are already in a precarious state, which is independent of the rule's effect.therefore, the hypothesis cannot be inferred from the premise."
6381,The bald man sidestepped and kicked the man in the groin.,The bald man kicked the woman in the groin.,0,0,True,"step 1: the premise describes an action where a bald man kicks another man in the groin. no specific relationship between the bald man and the woman is mentioned in the premise. step 2: the hypothesis suggests a different subject for the action, proposing that the bald man kicked a woman instead of the man in the premise. this is a contradiction to the information given in the premise as there is no indication that the bald man had any interaction with the woman at all. step 3: based on the logical analysis, the hypothesis is not entailed by the premise as it contradicts the information given in the premise."
6382,"Many had to leave their birthplaces, fleeing to Lesvos, Chios, and Samos, the Greek-ruled islands just offshore.",Everyone was able to remain in their homeland. ,0,0,True,"step 1: in the premise, 'many had to leave their birthplaces' indicates a large number of people were forced to migrate or flee from their homelands. the destinations mentioned, lesvos, chios, and samos, are greek-ruled islands off the coast. step 2: in contrast, the hypothesis states 'everyone was able to remain in their homeland.' this is a contradiction to the premise, as 'everyone' cannot remain in their homeland if 'many' had to leave. step 3: based on the logical contradiction between the premise and hypothesis, the hypothesis is not entailed by the premise. "
6383,A woman in a dress talking on the phone while holding a dog leash.,A woman is talking on the phone.,1,1,True,"step 1: in the premise, the woman is identified as being in a dress and talking on the phone while holding a dog leash. the key information here is that the woman is talking on the phone. the presence of the dog leash does not contradict this information. step 2: the hypothesis matches the premise exactly as it states that 'a woman is talking on the phone'. step 3: given that the hypothesis is identical to the premise, it can be inferred from the premise."
6384,Rumours as to its existence were emphatically denied.,All of the rumors were publicly confirmed.,0,0,True,"step 1: in the premise, it is stated that rumors about something were denied. this means that there were rumors circulating, but they were officially denied. the denial does not necessarily mean that the rumors were false, but rather that they were not confirmed.step 2: contradictorily, the hypothesis suggests that all of the rumors were publicly confirmed. this would mean that the opposite of the denial in the premise is true, and that the rumors were confirmed to be true.step 3: given the information in the premise and hypothesis, it is clear that they contradict each other. the hypothesis cannot be logically inferred from the premise, as they represent opposing statements.step 4: therefore, based on the logical contradiction between the premise and hypothesis, the hypothesis is not entailed by the premise."
6385,We also show how the advocate component of statewide websites promotes effective representation by sharing legal resources and expertise - generally a function of legal work supervisors.,Legal work supervisors serve no function in the legal arena.,0,0,True,"step 1: in the premise, it is stated that legal work supervisors perform a function in the promotion of effective representation through statewide websites by sharing legal resources and expertise. this implies that they have a role and value in the legal arena.step 2: the hypothesis states that legal work supervisors serve no function in the legal arena. this directly contradicts the information in the premise as it states that they do have a function.step 3: based on the information in the premise and the logical contradiction with the hypothesis, it can be concluded that the hypothesis is not entailed by the premise."
6386,"If you plan to visit during May, the carnival atmosphere of the Cheung Chau Bun Festival, with its high bamboo-and-paper towers covered in sticky buns, will fascinate the young ones.",The carnival atmosphere of the Cheung Chau Bun Festival is not suitable for the young ones,0,0,True,"step 1: in the premise, it is stated that the cheung chau bun festival has a carnival atmosphere that will fascinate young ones. this implies that the festival is generally considered an enjoyable experience for children. step 2: the hypothesis, on the other hand, suggests that the carnival atmosphere of the festival is not suitable for young ones. this contradicts the information in the premise as it indicates a negative experience for young ones. step 3: a review of the logical principles and common sense reveals that the hypothesis cannot be logically inferred from the premise as the premise describes the festival as an attractive event for young ones, while the hypothesis suggests the opposite."
6387,uh i'm i'm not real sure that the young girls of today are being forced into the job market as many of them imply i think they're going in by choice,There are always jobs available for young girls today.,1,0,False,"step 1: in the premise, the speaker expresses doubt about the claim that young girls are being forced into the job market. however, they also acknowledge that some girls may be going into the job market by choice. step 2: the hypothesis does not directly contradict the premise as it also mentions that jobs are available for young girls. it is possible that the availability of jobs is a reason why girls are going into the job market, either by choice or due to circumstances. step 3: based on the given information, the hypothesis cannot be logically inferred from the premise as the premise does not definitively establish that all girls are going into the job market due to the availability of jobs. however, it does not contradict the hypothesis either, as the hypothesis does not claim that all girls are going into the job market, only that jobs are available for them."
6388,"The above changes would allow substantial reductions in the complexity of rates and in the complexity of the data systems, which in turn would allow improvements in the costs and volumes for the subclasses that remained.",The above changes will not allow reductions in complexity of rates and data systems.,0,0,True,"step 1: the premise states that the above changes would lead to substantial reductions in the complexity of rates and data systems, which would result in improvements in costs and volumes. this implies that the changes are expected to simplify the systems in question. step 2: the hypothesis, however, states that the changes will not allow reductions in complexity. this is a direct contradiction of the premise. step 3: based on the logical relationship between the premise and hypothesis, there is no entailment. the hypothesis is not a logical consequence of the premise."
6390,"Dozens of street performers in fuchsia, red, yellow and black outfits are dancing and singing along a city street.",A group of silent mummers were performing in the park.,0,0,True,"step 1: the premise describes a scene where street performers in various colors are dancing and singing along a city street. this implies a public performance with music and movement. step 2: the hypothesis describes a different type of performance, 'silent mummers', which is not mentioned in the premise. this difference in the type of performance is significant and cannot be logically inferred from the information given in the premise. step 3: based on the lack of common information between the premise and hypothesis, the hypothesis cannot be logically inferred from the premise."
6391,"They officially became the first men to set foot on the heavily forested island, naming it Ilha da Madeira,  Island of Timber.  ",They named it the Island of Timber because their lucrative logging operations there made them a fortune.,1,1,True,"step 1. the premise states that the men were the first to set foot on ilha da madeira, an island they named 'island of timber'. this suggests that the island was abundant in timber, which is a common source of wealth from logging operations. step 2. the hypothesis relates to the premise as it also mentions the name 'island of timber' and implies that it was named due to lucrative logging operations. the fact that the premise establishes the men as the first settlers on the island does not contradict the hypothesis, as it is reasonable for the men to name the island based on the most significant resource they found there. step 3. based on the information provided, the hypothesis can be reasonably inferred from the premise. the premise implies the presence of timber, which is a necessary condition for the hypothesis to hold true. the hypothesis, in turn, provides an explanation for why the island was named 'island of timber'."
6392,away from the children,No adults allowed near the children,1,1,True,"step 1: in the premise, 'away from the children' implies keeping a certain distance from children to ensure their safety. in the hypothesis, 'no adults allowed near the children' means that adults are not permitted to be in the vicinity of children. both statements convey the idea of keeping a certain group of people (in this case, adults) at a distance from children for safety reasons. this is a logically consistent relationship.step 2: the hypothesis 'no adults allowed near the children' can be inferred from the premise 'away from the children' because 'away from' implies exclusion, which is a stronger condition than 'not allowed near'. if adults are not allowed near children, then they are, by definition, kept away from them.step 3: based on logical reasoning and the consistent relationship between the premise and hypothesis, the hypothesis 'no adults allowed near the children' is a logical entailment of the premise 'away from the children'."
6393,"In the initial stages, a number of minor clashes took place between Khilafat volunteers and the police, but the violence soon spread across the region.","In the initial stages, a number of minor clashes took place between Khilafat volunteers and the police.",0,1,False,"step 1: the premise describes an initial stage of minor clashes between khilafat volunteers and the police. no specific information contradicts the hypothesis, which also states that minor clashes took place between the same entities in the initial stages. step 2: the hypothesis is fully consistent with the information in the premise and does not logically contradict it. in fact, the hypothesis is a part of the premise itself. step 3: given that the hypothesis is logically consistent with the premise and is, in fact, a part of the premise, it can be inferred that the hypothesis is entailed by the premise."
6394,"To  In high school the jocks are on top (unless, of course, armed losers storm the cafeteria one day and mow them down).",Armed losers who hate the jocks are often geeks or nerds.,1,0,False,"step 1. the premise describes a common high school hierarchy where jocks are in a position of power. there is a mention of an unlikely event where this power dynamic could be disrupted. the hypothesis introduces a different group of people, 'armed losers who hate the jocks'.step 2. the premise does not provide any direct information about the identity or characteristics of the 'armed losers'. however, the term 'losers' is often used colloquially to refer to individuals who are not successful or popular, which could potentially include geeks or nerds. this connection is based on common sense and societal stereotypes.step 3. while the premise does not directly entail the hypothesis, the hypothesis is not contradictory to the premise and could potentially be true in the context described. the presence of the jocks in a position of power could create animosity from certain groups, including geeks or nerds.step 4. ultimately, the hypothesis being true depends on the specific context and details of the situation, which are not provided in the premise. without more information, it is impossible to definitively say that the hypothesis is entailed by the premise.therefore, based on the given information, the hypothesis is not directly entailed by the premise, but it is not contradictory and could potentially be true in certain contexts."
6396,"This site provides links to other federal financial management related sites such as the Federal Accounting Standards Advisory Board, Joint Financial Management Improvement Program, CFO Council, and federal finance offices.",This website has links to things unrelated to federal financial management. ,0,0,True,"step 1: in the premise, it is stated that this site provides links to various federal financial management related sites and offices. this implies that the primary focus of the site is on federal financial management. step 2: the hypothesis suggests that the site has links to things unrelated to federal financial management. if the hypothesis were true, it would contradict the premise. however, there is no explicit information in the premise that rules out the presence of unrelated links. it's possible for a site to have multiple sections or areas of focus. step 3: based on the available information, it cannot be logically deduced that the hypothesis is entailed by the premise. while the hypothesis contradicts the premise if we assume the premise to be exhaustive, the premise does not necessarily exclude the presence of unrelated links. therefore, no entailment exists."
6397,A Better Match of Policy and Incentives Is Needed to Ensure Capture of Design and Manufacturing Knowledge,The current policies are harmful to the manufacturing community.,1,0,False,"step 1: in the premise, it is stated that a better match of policy and incentives is required to capture design and manufacturing knowledge. this implies that there is a mismatch between the current policies and the desired outcomes. it does not necessarily mean that the current policies are harmful, but rather that they are not effective in achieving the goal.step 2: the hypothesis states that the current policies are harmful to the manufacturing community. this is a stronger statement than the premise which only implies a mismatch. the hypothesis goes beyond the information provided in the premise and makes an additional assumption.step 3: based on the given information, the hypothesis cannot be logically inferred from the premise. the premise only states that the current policies are not effective, while the hypothesis makes an unsupported assumption about their harm to the manufacturing community. without further evidence or context, it is not reasonable to infer that the current policies are harmful based on the given premise."
6398,That's true.,That is backed up by solid evidence.,1,0,False,"step 1: in the given premise, the sentence 'that's true' is a statement acknowledging that the preceding statement is factual. it does not provide new information or relationships. the hypothesis, 'that is backed up by solid evidence', is a statement about the evidence supporting the truth of the initial statement. step 2: the hypothesis can be seen as a strengthening or elaboration of the premise, as it provides additional context about the evidence base for the stated fact. however, the hypothesis does not logically follow from the premise as it introduces a new concept ('solid evidence') not explicitly mentioned in the premise. step 3: although the hypothesis is related to the premise, it is not logically entailed by it. the hypothesis goes beyond the information provided in the premise and requires independent verification."
6399,That story remains to be told.,The story will be told tomorrow.,1,0,False,"step 1: in the premise, 'that story remains to be told' implies that the story has not yet been shared or completed. it does not provide any specific information about when the story will be told. step 2: the hypothesis, 'the story will be told tomorrow', introduces a new piece of information not present in the premise. there is no logical connection or necessary implication from the premise to this hypothesis. step 3: based on the given information and the logical principle that a premise does not logically entail a hypothesis if the hypothesis introduces new information not logically following from the premise, the hypothesis is not entailed by the premise.step 4: it's important to note that the lack of entailment does not imply contradiction. the premise and hypothesis can still be consistent, as the hypothesis might be false or unrelated to the premise."
6400,Such records can provide valuable input for risk assessments and budgetary decisions.,Records such as these are not very useful.,0,0,True,"step 1: in the premise, it is stated that records can provide valuable input for risk assessments and budgetary decisions. this implies that records contain important information that can influence decision-making processes. step 2: the hypothesis, on the other hand, asserts that records 'such as these' are not very useful. however, no specific information is provided about the nature of these records or why they would be less useful than others. without further context, it is not possible to directly infer that the hypothesis contradicts the premise. step 3: in order to determine if the hypothesis can be logically inferred from the premise, we would need additional information to ensure that the hypothesis applies to the same type of records as those described in the premise. without this information, it is not possible to make a definitive conclusion. step 4: given the lack of sufficient information to make a logical inference, we must assume that there is no entailment between the premise and hypothesis."
6401,"In an area stretching from the permanently traffic-jammed Piazza Dante, between Via San Biagio dei Librai and Via Tribunali and over to the Porta Capuana, the popular image of old Naples survives.",Piazza Dante is the busiest road in the city.,1,0,False,"step 1: in the premise, piazza dante is described as 'permanently traffic-jammed', indicating heavy congestion and a large volume of vehicle traffic. this information, however, does not necessarily mean that piazza dante is the busiest road in the city as it only suggests that the area around piazza dante experiences heavy traffic. step 2: the hypothesis that 'piazza dante is the busiest road in the city' cannot be logically inferred from the premise, as the premise does not provide sufficient evidence to support this claim. the description of traffic congestion in piazza dante does not automatically mean that no other roads in the city have more vehicles passing through them. step 3: based on the information provided, the hypothesis is not entailed by the premise."
6402,"From viewing stations alongside other pits, you can watch on-going excavations and view the amalgamated bones of the unfortunate prehistoric beasts that perished here.",Several complete giant anteater skeletons have been pulled from the pits.,1,0,False,"step 1: the premise describes a scene where one can observe excavations and the bones of prehistoric animals from viewing stations. the use of the word 'amalgamated' implies that the bones are not complete and are likely mixed together. there is no mention of giant anteater skeletons or any specific species in the premise.step 2: the hypothesis suggests that several complete giant anteater skeletons have been pulled from the pits. the existence of complete skeletons contradicts the information in the premise that the bones are amalgamated and not complete.step 3: based on the given information, the hypothesis cannot be logically inferred from the premise as it contradicts the information provided in the premise."
6403,Players score by driving a small white plastic or wooden ball into the opposing team's goal using a long-handled mallet.,Players score by driving a small white copper or wooden ball into the opposing team's goal using a long-handled mallet.,1,1,True,"step 1: in the premise, players are described as scoring by driving a small white plastic or wooden ball into the opposing team's goal using a long-handled mallet. this is a common description for the game of lacrosse or hockey. the key information here is that players are scoring goals by moving the ball into the opposing team's goal.step 2: the hypothesis states that players score by driving a small white copper or wooden ball into the opposing team's goal using a long-handled mallet. this is almost identical to the premise, with the only difference being the material of the ball (copper instead of plastic or wooden). given that the premise describes a common game scenario and the material of the ball does not significantly impact the scoring mechanism, it is reasonable to infer that the hypothesis can be derived from the premise.step 3: based on the logical reasoning and the lack of contradictory information, the hypothesis is a reasonable inference from the premise."
6404,"The childlike playfulness of the doomed queen's hideaway is reinforced by the Hameau, a hamlet of thatched cottages where she and her retinue pretended to be milkmaids and farm boys.",The queen had a very happy and loving childhood.,1,0,False,"step 1: the premise describes the queen's hideaway as a place of childlike playfulness, reinforced by the hameau where she and her retinue assumed the roles of milkmaids and farm boys. this suggests an environment where the queen felt free, joyful, and carefree. step 2: the hypothesis, stating that the queen had a very happy and loving childhood, is not a direct logical consequence of the premise. however, the premise can provide evidence supporting the hypothesis. having a childhood filled with joy and love is not the same as being in a playful environment, but the former is often a reasonable inference from the latter based on common sense and general human experiences. step 3: while the hypothesis cannot be logically deduced from the premise alone, it can be reasonably inferred based on the information given and common sense understanding of human experiences. the premise paints a picture of a happy and carefree environment, which is typically associated with a loving childhood. therefore, the hypothesis is a likely, but not logically guaranteed, outcome based on the premise."
6405,"Alternatively, there are Sousa and Goncalves (Rua do Castanheiro, 47) and Unibasket (Rua do Carmo, 42; Tel. 291/226 925), both in Funchal.",There is nothing in Funchal.,0,0,True,"step 1: in the premise, there are two entities mentioned, sousa and goncalves, and unibasket, both located in funchal. this suggests that there are at least two existing entities in funchal. step 2: the hypothesis states that 'there is nothing' in funchal. this directly contradicts the information in the premise, which establishes the existence of at least two entities. step 3: based on the logical principles, the hypothesis cannot be inferred from the premise as it contradicts the premise's factual information."
6406,"Meteorologists had predicted the storm would equal 1992's Hurricane Andrew in power and destruction, but Bret hit the least-populated stretch of the Gulf Coast and was quickly downgraded to a tropical storm.","Meteorologists had made a bad prediction about Bret, and they're always wrong about storm predictions.",1,0,False,"step 1: in the premise, meteorologists had predicted that storm bret would have the same power and destruction as hurricane andrew in 1992. however, the storm ended up hitting a less populated area and was downgraded to a tropical storm. this means the prediction did not result in the destruction and power the meteorologists had anticipated. step 2: the hypothesis suggests that meteorologists are always wrong about storm predictions. this is not an accurate conclusion based on the given premise. while it's true that one incorrect prediction was made, the hypothesis makes a generalization about all meteorological storm predictions, which is not supported by the information in the premise. step 3: based on the logical reasoning and the lack of sufficient evidence to support the hypothesis, the hypothesis is not entailed by the premise."
6407,"In the last test Anna barely managed to stay within the limit, but right now she had problems with her father in law who's been luring her husband into alcohol, and with her husband who's been luring the father in law into drugs.",Anna had no trouble with her test and her family has no problems with drugs and alcohol.,0,0,True,"step 1: in the premise, anna's performance in the last test is described as 'barely managing to stay within the limit.' this implies that her test results were close to failing. additionally, the premise describes problems with anna's family, specifically mentioning issues with her father-in-law luring her husband into alcohol and her husband luring the father-in-law into drugs. these issues suggest that there are problems with alcohol and drugs in anna's family.step 2: the hypothesis states that anna had no trouble with her test and her family has no problems with drugs and alcohol. this directly contradicts the information provided in the premise.step 3: based on the logical relationship between the premise and hypothesis, it is clear that the hypothesis is not entailed by the premise. in fact, the hypothesis contradicts the premise."
6408,that's good  they scaled down quite a bit they have a lot of changes out there lately,The changes make it better.,1,1,True,"step 1: in the premise, it is mentioned that there have been a lot of changes recently and that these changes have resulted in a significant reduction in size (scaled down). the word 'significant' implies that the changes are not insignificant and could potentially have a noticeable effect. the statement 'they have a lot of changes out there lately' suggests that these changes are new and recent.step 2: the hypothesis states that 'the changes make it better'. this can be logically inferred from the premise based on the common sense understanding that improvements or enhancements often result in a positive outcome. the fact that the changes have led to a significant reduction in size also implies that they could potentially address issues or improve the overall experience.step 3: based on the logical reasoning and common sense understanding, the hypothesis 'the changes make it better' can be inferred from the premise."
6409,"User feedback is expected early in 2003, after which the tools will be modified if necessary and distributed.",The tools will be completely redesigned if the user feedback calls for it. ,1,1,True,"step 1: in the premise, user feedback is expected in early 2003, and the tools will be modified if necessary. this implies that the tools may require changes based on the feedback received. no contradictory information is given in the premise.step 2: the hypothesis states that the tools will be 'completely redesigned' if the user feedback calls for it. this means that significant changes will be made to the tools based on user feedback. given that the premise indicates that modifications will be made to the tools based on user feedback, it is reasonable to infer that the tools might need a complete redesign in some cases.step 3: based on the logical connection between the premise and hypothesis, and the lack of contradictory information, the hypothesis can be inferred from the premise. the hypothesis is a reasonable implication of the premise."
6410,"Northern India is simply impractical in December, Delhi unbearably hot in June, and trains uncertain in the monsoon.",Delhi cools down by September.,1,0,False,"step 1. in the premise, we have three statements about the weather conditions in northern india, specifically delhi, at different times of the year. the first statement indicates that december in northern india, including delhi, is impractical due to cold weather. the second statement mentions that delhi is unbearably hot in june. lastly, we learn that trains are uncertain in the monsoon.step 2. the hypothesis suggests that delhi cools down by september. the weather conditions mentioned in the premise do not directly contradict or support this hypothesis. however, the premise does not provide any information that would infer that delhi is still hot in september. it is common sense that weather conditions change over the course of a year, and it is not unreasonable to assume that delhi would cool down by september.step 3. based on the information provided in the premise and common-sense reasoning, the hypothesis cannot be logically inferred from the premise as there is not enough information to support the statement. however, the hypothesis is not contradictory to the premise either.step 4. the hypothesis that delhi cools down by september is not entailed by the premise."
6411,The ruble.,Chinese money.,0,0,True,"step 1: in this context, the premise does not provide enough information to make a logical inference. 'the ruble' is a currency, specifically the currency of russia. it does not imply any connection to china or chinese money. step 2: the hypothesis 'chinese money' is unrelated to the premise as there is no logical connection or implication between the two. step 3: based on the lack of information and logical connection, the hypothesis cannot be logically inferred from the premise."
6412,You can see the art of mosaics still being practised in workshops along the nearby Via Giuliano Argentario.,The art of mosaics has been practiced here for centuries.,1,1,True,"step 1: in the premise, it is stated that mosaics are still being practised in workshops in via giuliano argentario. this implies that mosaic-making is a long-standing tradition in this area. step 2: the hypothesis suggests that mosaics have been practiced in this place for centuries, which aligns with the information in the premise. there is no contradictory information in the premise or hypothesis. step 3: the hypothesis can be reasonably inferred from the premise, as the premise indicates that mosaic-making is a long-standing tradition, and the hypothesis states that it has been practiced for centuries in this very place."
6413,Those flowery moves may blow up the underskirts of young noble women but they will get you killed out here.,The flowery moves were being performed on a battlefield.,1,1,True,"step 1: in the premise, 'those flowery moves' are described as being inappropriate for a social setting, potentially revealing the underskirts of young noble women. however, the premise also states that these moves will get you killed 'out here', implying a dangerous or deadly context, such as a battlefield. step 2: the hypothesis states that 'the flowery moves were being performed on a battlefield'. this hypothesis is consistent with the premise since the premise implies that the flowery moves are taking place in a dangerous context. in fact, the hypothesis provides more specific information about the context being a battlefield. step 3: based on the logical consistency of the hypothesis with the premise, the hypothesis can be inferred from the premise. the flowery moves being described as deadly in the premise already implies they are likely to be in a battlefield setting."
6414,A man and a woman standing on a sidewalk in between buildings.,People stand on the sidewalk between buildings.,1,1,True,"step 1: in the premise, we have the specific instance of two people standing on a sidewalk between buildings. the information provided does not contradict the hypothesis in any way. step 2: the hypothesis is a more general statement, which can be logically inferred from the premise because the man and the woman are examples of 'people' and they are indeed 'standing' on the 'sidewalk' 'between buildings'. step 3: based on the logical relationship between the two statements and the absence of contradictory information, the hypothesis can be inferred from the premise."
6415,It was the main entry point into Egypt until the advent of air travel in the early 20th century and its contact with a range of international influences made it the most cosmopolitan city in Egypt.,Egypt was entirely cut off from the rest of the world until the 20th century.,0,0,True,"step 1: the premise describes thebes (a city in egypt) as the main entry point into egypt until the early 20th century. it also mentions that thebes was cosmopolitan due to its contact with various international influences. step 2: the hypothesis suggests that egypt was entirely cut off from the rest of the world before the 20th century. this contradicts the premise, which states that thebes was in contact with international influences and that egypt, at least through thebes, was not entirely cut off from the world. step 3: based on the given information, the hypothesis cannot be inferred from the premise as it contradicts the facts stated in the premise."
6416,"In fact, as he looked, he could make out a rift, and beyond that a ...","His heart was pounding, as he knew he did not have long to figure out what it was he was looking at.",1,0,False,"step 1: in the premise, the person is looking at something and can make out a rift or opening. there is no specific information about what is beyond the rift. the hypothesis describes the person's emotional response to the situation.step 2: the hypothesis does not logically follow from the premise. the fact that the person's heart is pounding does not provide any information about what he is looking at or the nature of the rift. their heart pounding could be due to various reasons, such as fear, excitement, or uncertainty, and it does not necessarily mean that they are in immediate danger.step 3: based on the given information, there is no logical entailment between the premise and hypothesis. the hypothesis is not a necessary conclusion that can be inferred from the premise."
6417,uh have proven that there is a link between the ingestation of chlorine and arteriosclerosis which is heart attack,It has been proven that there is absolutely no link between arteriosclerosis and the consumption of chlorine. ,0,0,True,"step 1: the premise asserts that 'uh have proven' a link between chlorine ingestion and arteriosclerosis, which is a condition that can lead to heart attacks. this implies that there is some scientific evidence or research that supports this claim. step 2: the hypothesis directly contradicts the premise, stating that 'there is absolutely no link' between arteriosclerosis and chlorine consumption. step 3: given that the two statements contradict each other, it is not possible for both to be true at the same time. the hypothesis cannot be logically inferred from the premise, as it denies the very thing the premise asserts.step 4: it is important to note that the truth or falsehood of the premise or hypothesis does not depend on our personal beliefs or common sense, but rather on the existence and validity of the scientific evidence or research that underlies them. therefore, while common sense might suggest that certain substances are not linked to certain health conditions, it should not be the sole basis for logical reasoning in this context. step 5: in conclusion, the hypothesis is not entailed by the premise due to their contradictory nature."
6418,um but it's such a grind and you begin to wonder you know if if i'm not i mean you really have to be dead set on being a lawyer,This person has worked very hard all of their life to become a lawyer.,1,1,True,"step 1: in the premise, the speaker expresses doubts about being a lawyer, mentioning it as a grind and questioning their commitment. however, the premise also implies that the person has been working hard to achieve this goal. when someone expresses doubts about their path in life, it doesn't necessarily mean they haven't worked hard to get there. instead, it might indicate a struggle or uncertainty. in this case, the premise suggests that the person has made a significant effort to become a lawyer.step 2: the hypothesis states that the person has worked very hard all of their life to become a lawyer. this hypothesis is an entailed version of the premise. the premise implies that the person is working hard to become a lawyer, and the hypothesis extends this implication to cover the entirety of their life.step 3: based on the logical reasoning that the hypothesis is a more specific version of the premise, and the premise's implication of hard work, the hypothesis is a logical entailment of the premise."
6419,"Its foundation may date back to the third century, but the present structure is the work of Pope Innocent II, himself a Trasteverino, around 1140.","Its foundation was made in 1140, while the structure itself was built in the third century.",0,0,True,"step 1: in the premise, we have two pieces of information. the first is a possible early origin for the foundation of the structure, which dates back to the third century. the second is that the present structure was built around 1140. the third piece of information is that pope innocent ii, a local resident of trastevere, was responsible for the construction. step 2: the hypothesis proposes that the foundation was established in 1140 while the structure itself is from the third century. this hypothesis contradicts the information in the premise, as the premise states that the present structure was built around 1140, which is not compatible with the third-century structure suggested in the hypothesis. step 3: based on the logical reasoning and factual inconsistency between the premise and hypothesis, the hypothesis is not entailed by the premise."
6420,A dog runs along the ocean surf.,A cat is running in the waves.,0,0,True,"step 1: the premise describes a scene of a dog running near the ocean surf. it does not provide any information about a cat or its whereabouts. there is no logical connection or commonsense reason to infer the presence or actions of a cat based on the given information about the dog. step 2: the hypothesis suggests a scene where a cat is running in the waves. however, this hypothesis contradicts the given premise as there is no mention or implication of a cat in the premise. step 3: based on the logical analysis and the contradiction between the premise and hypothesis, the hypothesis is not entailed by the premise."
6421,"I can't help feeling, I continued blunderingly; ""that we've rather left her out of the possible suspects, simply on the strength of her having been away from the place. ","Because she was not present, she must be guilty.",0,0,True,"step 1: in the premise, the speaker expresses a feeling that they may have overlooked a suspect based on her absence from the place. this implies that the speaker believes it is unusual for a suspect to be absent in this context. however, the premise does not provide any definitive information about the guilt or innocence of the suspected person.step 2: the hypothesis suggests the opposite of the commonsense assumption implied in the premise, implying that being absent makes one guilty. however, it is important to note that absence does not logically imply guilt. there can be many reasons why a person is not present at a crime scene, and it is not fair or logical to assume guilt based on absence alone.step 3: based on logical reasoning and common sense, the hypothesis cannot be inferred from the premise. the premise does not provide sufficient evidence to support the hypothesis, and the hypothesis goes against the logical assumption that absence does not imply guilt."
6422,What do they do all day?,What do you do for work?,0,0,True,"step 1: in the premise, 'they' is a vague pronoun that could refer to various groups or individuals. the question asks 'what do they do all day', which implies a general inquiry about daily activities. the hypothesis, 'what do you do for work', is a specific question asking about a person's occupation. although they are related concepts, the hypothesis is not directly inferred from the premise because the premise does not specify the subject of the question.  step 2: the hypothesis is not logically entailed by the premise as the premise is asking about daily activities in general, and the hypothesis is asking about a specific type of daily activity, work.  step 3: based on the analysis, the hypothesis is not logically inferred from the premise."
6423,"Annually, $3.",The amount will increase next year.,1,0,False,"step 1: in the premise, the context implies an annual amount of $3, which does not provide enough information to determine if it will increase or decrease in the next year. however, the use of the word 'annually' suggests a consistent pattern, but it does not necessarily mean the amount cannot change.step 2: the hypothesis states that the amount will increase next year, which is not explicitly stated or logically deduced from the premise. increase in this context requires new information or an assumption that the amount is not static.step 3: based on the given information, the hypothesis 'the amount will increase next year' cannot be logically inferred from the premise 'annually, $3'."
6424,"His proved an appropriate choice, as he almost single-handedly created the mod?Υrn Turkish state.",He created the whole middle east by taking charge of the armies.,0,0,True,"step 1. the premise describes how 'his' (an unspecified person) proved an appropriate choice because he created the modern turkish state almost single-handedly. this implies that 'his' actions led to the establishment of a new and significant political entity. step 2. the hypothesis suggests that 'he' (presumably the same person as in the premise) created the whole middle east by taking charge of the armies. however, this is a significant exaggeration from the facts presented in the premise. the premise does not mention any involvement of 'he' in the creation of other middle eastern states. step 3. based on the information identified in step 1 and the logical inconsistency between the premise and hypothesis in step 2, the hypothesis is not entailed by the premise.step 4. (optional) it's important to note that the hypothesis is a major overstatement, as creating an entire region like the middle east is a much more extensive undertaking than creating a single state, which is what the premise describes. the hypothesis is not a reasonable or logical inference from the premise."
6425,It's almost barbaric in a certain way.,The punishment is almost barbaric. ,1,1,True,"step 1: in the premise, the speaker uses the term 'it's almost barbaric' to describe a situation or an action. the term 'barbaric' implies something primitive, cruel, or uncivilized. step 2: the hypothesis 'the punishment is almost barbaric' describes the punishment as being similar in nature to something primitive, cruel, or uncivilized. given that the premise describes something as 'almost barbaric' without providing enough context to determine what the speaker is referring to, it is reasonable to infer that the speaker is discussing a punishment based on the tone and the word choice. step 3: based on the given context, it is logical to infer that the hypothesis 'the punishment is almost barbaric' can be inferred from the premise as it describes a situation or action that is similar in nature to what is described in the premise."
6426,"Then, after Alexander's death in 323 b.c. , Cleomenes took control of the country under the name Ptolemy I. The new city of Alexandria, located on the Mediterranean coast, became the base for the Ptolemaic control of Egypt and the cultural capital of Europe, and Thebes finally lost its influence.","Alexandria and Thebes, both influential cities, coexisted as pillars of Egyptian society throughout the rule of Ptolemy. ",0,0,True,"step 1: in the premise, alexander's death in 323 b.c. marks a significant shift in power, with cleomenes taking control under the name ptolemy i. the premise also states that alexandria became the cultural capital of europe and the base for the ptolemaic control of egypt. thebes, on the other hand, lost its influence. however, the premise does not explicitly mention that alexandria and thebes stopped being influential cities during ptolemy's rule. step 2: the hypothesis suggests that alexandria and thebes coexisted as influential cities during ptolemy's rule, which is not directly stated or contradicted in the premise. step 3: based on the given information and logical principles, the hypothesis cannot be definitively determined to be entailed by the premise or not, as the premise does not provide sufficient detail regarding the relative influence of alexandria and thebes during ptolemy's rule. the logical connection between the two sentences is not strong enough to infer the hypothesis from the premise."

6428,"Real crime, you'd know at once.""",Real crime is easy to tell.,1,1,True,"step 1: in the premise, 'real crime' is described as something that is easily recognizable or noticeable. this implies that there are distinct characteristics or signs that set real crime apart from other situations.step 2: the hypothesis 'real crime is easy to tell' is a paraphrase of the premise, restating that real crime is distinguishable or recognizable. since the hypothesis is a restatement of the premise, it can be considered an entailed consequence, as the information in the hypothesis is already present in the premise.step 3: based on the logical reasoning, the hypothesis is entailed by the premise."
6429,"But the explanation is institutional, not ideological.",Many experts have argued that it's impossible to separate the institutional from the ideological in the circumstances.,1,0,False,"step 1: the premise states that the explanation given is institutional, meaning it relates to the rules, structure, or practices of an organization. it does not suggest any involvement of ideology. step 2: the hypothesis argues that the institutional and ideological cannot be separated, which is a point of view that some experts hold. step 3: however, the premise itself does not support or contradict this hypothesis. the premise only describes the nature of the explanation provided and does not make a statement about the possibility or impossibility of separating the institutional from the ideological. therefore, the hypothesis cannot be logically inferred from the premise. step 4: the hypothesis may be a valid perspective, but it requires additional evidence or context beyond the given premise to be proven."

6462,Employees at all levels of high-performing organizations participate in--and have a stake in--improving operational and program performance to achieve results.,Employees at higher levels of experience participate more in improving operations performance.,1,1,True,"step 1: in the premise, it is stated that employees at all levels of high-performing organizations participate in improving operational and program performance. this implies that employees at different levels contribute to the betterment of their organization. step 2: the hypothesis suggests that employees with higher levels of experience participate more in improving operational performance. this relationship can be inferred from the premise as it is a logical extension of the idea that all employees contribute to performance improvement. it is common sense and supported by research that employees with more experience often have a greater understanding of the organization's operations and processes, making them more effective in improving performance. step 3: based on the logical reasoning, common sense understanding, and factual consistency with research, the hypothesis can be inferred from the premise.label: 1"
6463,they are just they have such a better more mature outlook on life and i think they're better people because of it they're much more responsible i know um,They are unaware of a better outlook on life.,0,0,True,"step 1: in the premise, the speaker expresses their belief that 'they' (the referred group) have a better outlook on life and are more responsible. no specific information is given about 'they' being unaware of a better outlook. step 2: the hypothesis 'they are unaware of a better outlook on life' contradicts the premise, as it suggests the opposite of what the premise asserts. step 3: based on the provided information, the hypothesis 'they are unaware of a better outlook on life' cannot be logically inferred from the premise 'they have such a better more mature outlook on life and i think they're better people because of it they're much more responsible'. in fact, the premise implies that 'they' are aware of and have adopted a better outlook on life. therefore, the hypothesis is not entailed by the premise."
6464,"Since Japan's Shinto deities are believed to permeate the natural surroundings in this case, a beautiful cedar forest the man-made shrine is just there for the fleeting present moment.",Shinto deities are believed to live in man-made structures.,0,0,True,"step 1. the premise describes the belief that shinto deities exist in the natural world and that a man-made shrine is just a temporary structure for the present moment. this implies that shinto deities are not limited to man-made structures but can also inhabit natural surroundings. step 2. contrary to the hypothesis, the premise suggests that shinto deities do not primarily reside in man-made structures. the hypothesis, therefore, contradicts the premise. step 3. based on the information provided, the hypothesis 'shinto deities are believed to live in man-made structures' cannot be logically inferred from the premise 'since japan's shinto deities are believed to permeate the natural surroundings in this case, a beautiful cedar forest the man-made shrine is just there for the fleeting present moment'. in fact, the hypothesis is the opposite of what is stated in the premise."
6465,"(This document was written by David M. Walker, CPA, Comptroller General of the United States, based on a speech he gave to the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants' leadership conference in November 2002)",David M. Walker has never written a document based on any of his speeches. ,0,0,True,"step 1: in the premise, it is stated that david m. walker wrote a document based on a speech he gave. this is a clear statement of authorship and connection between the document and the speech. common sense and factual knowledge do not suggest any reason to question this statement. step 2: the hypothesis directly contradicts the information in the premise, as it asserts that david m. walker never wrote a document based on any of his speeches. logical analysis shows that the hypothesis cannot be inferred from the premise, as the premise explicitly states that david m. walker did write a document based on a speech. step 3: based on the logical contradiction between the premise and hypothesis, and the lack of any information or logical reasoning in the hypothesis that would allow it to be inferred from the premise, the hypothesis is not entailed by the premise."
6466,"Didion has always been an expert on coolness, numbness, in hot climates.",Didion doesn't know how to stay cool.,0,0,True,"step 1: in the premise, it is stated that didion is an expert on coolness and numbness in hot climates. this implies that didion has a deep understanding and ability to cope with heat. step 2: the hypothesis, 'didion doesn't know how to stay cool', contradicts the information provided in the premise. an expert on a subject is someone who possesses comprehensive knowledge, skills, and experience. it is illogical and implausible that an expert would lack basic knowledge or skills in their area of expertise, such as not knowing how to stay cool in hot climates. step 3: based on the logical contradiction between the premise and hypothesis, and the lack of any evidence or facts that would support the hypothesis, it cannot be logically inferred from the premise."
6467,"As the Democratic National Committee sinks deeper into scandal-related debt, the Democrats can look forward to running without a functional party organization to support them.","The Democratic National Committee is on the uptick, financially. ",0,0,True,"step 1: in the premise, it is stated that the democratic national committee (dnc) is sinking deeper into scandal-related debt. this implies a financial struggle and potential instability for the dnc. common sense and logical reasoning suggest that a party organization in such a state would not be in a good position to provide significant support for its candidates. step 2: the hypothesis, however, states that the dnc is on the uptick financially. this directly contradicts the premise. there is no logical or factual basis in the given information to infer that the dnc's financial situation has improved, especially considering the ongoing scandals mentioned in the premise. step 3: based on the logical analysis, the hypothesis cannot be inferred from the premise."
6468,"His ruthless campaigns resulted in more than 600,000 Irish dead or deported.",Only 10 Irish died or were deported as a result of his ruthless campaigns. ,0,0,True,"step 1: in the premise, 'more than 600,000 irish' refers to a large number of deaths or deportations caused by the ruthless campaigns. this implies a significant loss of life or displacement. step 2: the hypothesis states 'only 10 irish', which is an extremely low number in comparison to the premise. this directly contradicts the information provided in the premise. step 3: based on the logical inconsistency between the premise and hypothesis, the hypothesis cannot be inferred from the premise."
6469,"Just behind this is the Treasury Pavilion, where you can imagine Akbar seated on cushions under the arches and counting the imperial money.",The Akbar was concerned about the imperial money.,1,1,True,"step 1: in the premise, akbar is described as seated at the treasury pavilion, a place associated with the imperial money. this implies that akbar was likely involved in managing or counting the imperial money. step 2: the hypothesis, 'the akbar was concerned about the imperial money,' is a direct implication or entailment of the premise. the premise provides context about where akbar was and what he was doing, and the hypothesis explicitly states the concern that akbar had. step 3: given the logical connection between the premise and hypothesis, and the fact that the hypothesis is a logical consequence of the premise, the hypothesis can be inferred from the premise."
6470,"To the west on Jaffa Road is the large new municipal government center, Safra Square.",Safra Square is located far away from Jaffa Road.,0,0,True,"step 1: in the premise, it is stated that safra square is located 'to the west' on jaffa road. this implies a certain proximity, as 'to the west' suggests a direction within a relatively short distance. the term 'large new municipal government center' also implies a significant structure, which is typically associated with a central or easily accessible location. step 2: the hypothesis, stating that safra square is 'located far away from jaffa road', contradicts the information in the premise. it is not logically possible to infer that something is both 'located to the west' and 'located far away' on the same road. step 3: based on the logical inconsistency between the premise and hypothesis, the hypothesis is not entailed by the premise."
6471,"The author of the tune is unknown and it may originate in plainchant, but a 1619 attribution to John Bull is sometimes made.","The author of the tune is unknown and it may originate in plainchant, but a 1610 attribution to John Bull is sometimes made.",0,0,True,"step 1: both the premise and hypothesis share the same core information - the unknown origin of the tune and the possibility of it originating from plainchant. the premise mentions a 1619 attribution to john bull, while the hypothesis suggests a 1610 attribution instead. neither the premise nor the hypothesis contradict each other or provide any factual inconsistencies.step 2: the hypothesis is not logically inferred from the premise as they make identical claims about the unknown origin and possible plainchant origin of the tune, but differ in the specific attribution date to john bull. the hypothesis does not follow directly from the premise based on the information given.step 3: based on the logical analysis, the hypothesis cannot be inferred from the premise as they are not equivalent statements. both statements share the same core information, but the hypothesis introduces a new fact that is not logically implied by the premise."
6472,"Winter sports are one of Hokkaido's main draws for domestic tourism, with popular ski resorts at Teine Olympia (outside Sapporo), Niseko, and Kiroro.",It is always above 100 degress in  Hokkaido.,0,0,True,"step 1. in the premise, hokkaido is described as a destination known for winter sports and ski resorts. no temperature information is provided. common sense and factual knowledge indicate that winter sports and cold temperatures are typically associated. step 2. the hypothesis, 'it is always above 100 degrees in hokkaido', contradicts the common sense understanding and factual knowledge from the premise, as winter sports and temperatures below freezing are commonly associated. furthermore, there is no information in the premise that supports the hypothesis. step 3. based on the logical reasoning, the hypothesis cannot be inferred from the premise as it contradicts the information provided and is factually incorrect."
6473,"They survived as part of an abbey now the Musee National du Moyen Age, still often called by its former name, Musee de Cluny (see page 72).",The locals prefer to call the Musee National du Moyen Age by its old name.,1,1,True,"step 1: in the premise, it is mentioned that the musee national du moyen age is now called by its old name, musee de cluny, despite the new name. this implies that there is a preference or affinity among the locals to use the old name instead of the new one.step 2: the hypothesis, 'the locals prefer to call the musee national du moyen age by its old name', is directly stated in the premise, making it a logical entailment. the hypothesis is an explicit consequence of the information provided in the premise.step 3: based on the logical connection between the premise and hypothesis, the hypothesis is entailed by the premise."
6475,"However, the comment I object to is the one where you say there is never a handicapped person waiting to use it when you are done.","30% of the time, a handicapped person is waiting.",1,0,False,"step 1: in the premise, the speaker is expressing their objection to a specific comment. the comment in question is about the absence of handicapped individuals waiting to use a facility when others are finished. no information is given about the truth or falsity of this comment. step 2: the hypothesis introduces a new piece of information, stating that a handicapped person waits 30% of the time. this hypothesis contradicts the premise, as the two statements cannot both be true. step 3: based on the given information, the hypothesis cannot be logically inferred from the premise as it contradicts it."
6476,"She was saved all right, but they didn't seem able to hear of her over this side.","She was lost, but everyone heard about it.",0,0,True,"step 1: the premise describes a situation where she was saved, but no one seemed to be able to hear about it from her side. this implies that there was a communication problem or a physical separation preventing people from knowing about her situation.step 2: the hypothesis suggests that she was lost, but everyone heard about it. at first glance, this seems to contradict the premise as it implies that people did know about her situation despite the premise stating otherwise. however, it's important to consider the context and potential meanings of 'heard about it'. in this context, 'heard about it' could mean that people knew she was lost before she was found.step 3: given the information provided, it's not possible to definitively infer that 'she was lost, but everyone heard about it' is entailed by 'she was saved all right, but they didn't seem able to hear of her over this side'. the hypothesis seems to contradict the premise, but without additional context, it's unclear if they are logically related. for instance, she might have been lost before being saved, or she might have been saved and then people learned about her being lost. without further information, it's not possible to determine if the hypothesis is a logical consequence of the premise.step 4: based on the given information, the hypothesis is not logically entailed by the premise, as it introduces new information not directly related to the situation described in the premise."
6477,Three different women having fun with a toy in the living-room.,A police officer issues a citation.,0,0,True,"step 1: in the premise, there is no mention of a police officer or any legal infringement taking place. the scene described is of three women enjoying themselves in a living room with a toy. step 2: the hypothesis, 'a police officer issues a citation,' is unrelated to the women and their activities described in the premise. there is no logical connection or implication from the premise to the hypothesis. step 3: based on the given information and lack of logical connection or implication, the hypothesis cannot be inferred from the premise."
6478,A woman wearing sunglasses is holding a pink cellphone to her ear.,A lady is on her cellphone.,1,1,True,"step 1: in the premise, a woman is identified as using a cellphone. using a cellphone involves speaking into it, making a call or receiving one. this is a common usage of a cellphone. the woman is also described as wearing sunglasses, but this detail is not directly relevant to the hypothesis.step 2: the hypothesis 'a lady is on her cellphone' can be logically inferred from the premise 'a woman wearing sunglasses is holding a pink cellphone to her ear'. the hypothesis is a specific instance of the more general premise, as 'lady' is a type of 'woman'. the woman's use of the cellphone is the core action described in both sentences, and the hypothesis is a direct consequence of that action.step 3: based on the logical connection between the premise and hypothesis, and the lack of contradictory information, the hypothesis can be inferred from the premise."
6479,oh yeah i could go on and on about that,I could talk about that for hours.,1,1,True,"step 1: in the premise, the speaker expresses their ability to discuss a certain topic extensively. 'go on and on' implies a lengthy discourse. step 2: the hypothesis also suggests a lengthy discussion about the same topic. 'could talk about that for hours' expresses the speaker's willingness and capacity to discuss the topic at great length. step 3: given the semantic similarity between the premise and hypothesis, where both imply extended conversations about a topic, the hypothesis can be logically inferred from the premise. step 4: it is also common sense that if someone can speak at length about a topic in one context, they are likely able to continue that discussion in another context without significant interruption.step 5: there are no contradictory facts or logical inconsistencies in the given information that would prevent the hypothesis from being inferred from the premise.therefore, based on logical reasoning, semantic similarity, common sense, and the lack of contradictory facts, the hypothesis is entailed by the premise."
6480,Almost nine percent of Egyptians are Christian.,There are no practicing Christians living in Egypt. ,0,0,True,"step 1: analyzing the premise, 'almost nine percent of egyptians are christian,' indicates a factual statement about the religious demographics of egypt. it does not suggest any specific information about the practice or observance of christianity among these individuals.step 2: the hypothesis, 'there are no practicing christians living in egypt,' contradicts the premise by stating that no practicing christians live in egypt at all, despite the premise stating that nearly nine percent are christian.step 3: the hypothesis cannot be logically inferred from the premise because the premise does not provide sufficient evidence to support the hypothesis. the premise only establishes that a significant number of egyptians identify as christian, but it does not provide any information about their religious practices or observance. step 4: based on the given information, the hypothesis is not entailed by the premise as the premise does not imply the absence of practicing christians in egypt."
6481,Don't think Kitchell's some common ridge-ridin' bad man.,"Kitchell has never ridden in his life, he does not know how too.",0,0,True,"step 1: in the premise, 'kitchell' is described as 'some common ridge-ridin' bad man'. this implies that kitchell is known to ride something, likely a motorcycle or a horse, on ridges. however, the premise also states that the speaker does not want others to think that about him. this could mean that the speaker is trying to downplay or deny kitchell's reputation as a 'bad man' who rides on ridges, not necessarily denying that he rides at all. step 2: the hypothesis states that 'kitchell has never ridden in his life, he does not know how to'. this contradicts the premise as it implies that kitchell has no experience or knowledge of riding. step 3: based on the given information, the hypothesis cannot be logically inferred from the premise as they present contradictory information."
6482,"The only difference between Rust and the present case is that the former involved distortion of (that is to say, refusal to subsidize) the normal work of doctors, and the latter involves distortion of (that is to say, refusal to subsidize) the normal work of lawyers.","Rust and the present case are exactly the same, with no differences.",0,0,True,"step 1: analyzing the premise, the text states that rust and the present case are similar, with the only difference being the professions involved - doctors in the former and lawyers in the latter. the text also indicates that in both cases, there was a refusal to subsidize the normal work of the respective professionals. step 2: the hypothesis suggests that there are no differences between rust and the present case. this directly follows from the premise, as the premise already establishes that the only difference is a difference in professions. step 3: based on the logical relationship between the premise and hypothesis, the hypothesis can be inferred from the premise. however, it's important to note that the premise does not state or imply that there are no other potential differences between the two cases beyond the professions involved and the subsidies. therefore, while the hypothesis is a logical consequence of the premise, it might not be the complete or accurate description of the actual situation."
6483,"Ever heard of the word 'graft,'  ","There was stealing going on, or in other words graft.",1,1,True,"step 1: the premise introduces the term 'graft,' which is defined as the illegal acceptance of bribes or other illicit gains, especially in return for favorable treatment. step 2: the hypothesis interprets 'graft' in the same sense, implying an act of stealing or illicit gain. no contradiction is present between the premise and hypothesis. step 3: given that the premise and hypothesis both refer to 'graft,' meaning the same thing, the hypothesis can be logically inferred from the premise."
6484,"If necessary to meeting the restrictions imposed in the preceding sentence, the Administrator shall reduce, pro rata, the basic Phase II allowance allocations for each unit subject to the requirements of section 414.",Section 414 helps higher allowance allocations for each unit.,0,0,True,"step 1: in the premise, the administrator is required to reduce the basic phase ii allowance allocations for each unit if necessary to meet the restrictions imposed in the preceding sentence. this suggests that there are restrictions that limit the allowance allocations. the hypothesis does not mention any restriction or limit. step 2: the hypothesis that 'section 414 helps higher allowance allocations for each unit' is not logically inferred from the premise. in fact, the premise suggests the opposite - that the administrator is required to reduce allowance allocations. step 3: based on the logical analysis, the hypothesis is not entailed by the premise."
6485,"They arise from exchange transactions, which occur when each party to the transaction sacrifices value and receives value in return.",Exchange transactions result in value,1,1,True,"step 1: in the premise, exchange transactions are described as resulting from parties sacrificing value and receiving value in return. this implies that there is a net gain of value for each party involved in the transaction. common sense and logical reasoning suggest that the result of a value exchange is indeed value. step 2: the hypothesis proposes that exchange transactions result in value, which is a logical consequence of the premise, as it is a restatement of the outcome of exchange transactions being valuable. step 3: based on the logical connection between the premise and hypothesis, and the common-sense understanding that value is the expected outcome of a value exchange, the hypothesis is a logical entailment of the premise."
6486,Brill (or Drudge) tootles along and everyone in the McLean/Russert/West 57 th Street axis whines and moans about professionalism and standards.,Everyone in the area is thrilled about the standards.,0,0,True,"step 1. in the premise, brill or drudge is described as tootling along, and the mclean/russert/west 57th street axis is characterized as whining and moaning about professionalism and standards. this suggests a discourse or controversy regarding professional standards in the area.step 2. the hypothesis, 'everyone in the area is thrilled about the standards,' contradicts the information in the premise. the premise states that people are complaining about professional standards, while the hypothesis asserts that they are happy about it.step 3. based on the logical analysis and the given information, the hypothesis is not entailed by the premise. in fact, it contradicts the premise."
6487,The year of 1820 was a pivotal one in the story of the King?­dom of Hawaii.,Things have not been the same for Hawaii since 1820.,1,1,True,"step 1: in the premise, the year 1820 is identified as a pivotal moment in the history of the kingdom of hawaii. pivotal moments often mark significant changes or turning points in the course of events. step 2: the hypothesis suggests that the events following 1820 have differed substantially from those preceding it. this is a reasonable inference given the premise's characterization of 1820 as pivotal. step 3: based on the logical connection between a pivotal event and the subsequent changes it brings, the hypothesis can be inferred from the premise.step 4: it's also worth noting that the hypothesis does not contradict the premise, and there are no facts presented that would challenge the validity of the hypothesis.therefore, the hypothesis can be logically inferred from the premise."
6488,These actions are clearly steps in the right direction.,The actions were good,1,1,True,"step 1: in the premise, 'these actions' are described as 'steps in the right direction.' this phrase is often used to indicate progress towards a goal or desirable outcome. it implies that the actions are beneficial or positive in some way. common sense and logical reasoning suggest that 'good' actions would be those that move us towards our goals or desired outcomes.step 2: the hypothesis 'the actions were good' is logically consistent with the premise because if the actions are steps in the right direction, then they are indeed good. the phrase 'steps in the right direction' implies that the actions are beneficial or positive, which is the definition of 'good' in this context.step 3: based on the logical reasoning and common sense understanding of the given information, the hypothesis can be inferred from the premise."
6489,"He mainly designed also some secular buildings, including domestic properties and schools.","He mainly designed churches but also some secular buildings, including domestic properties and schools.",1,1,True,"step 1: in the premise, 'he mainly designed also some secular buildings' indicates that the person designed both secular buildings and that designing secular buildings was the primary focus. 'secular buildings' includes 'domestic properties and schools'. 'mainly designed' implies that the majority of the person's design work was on secular buildings. step 2: the hypothesis 'he mainly designed churches but also some secular buildings, including domestic properties and schools' states that the person designed both churches and secular buildings, with designing secular buildings being the primary focus. this is identical to the information in the premise. step 3: since the hypothesis is equivalent to the premise, the hypothesis can be logically inferred from the premise. step 4: there is no contradiction between the premise and hypothesis, as they both convey the same information. therefore, the hypothesis is entailed by the premise."
6491,well do your do any of your friends have have uh older children that they do anything with do  do you have friends with older children or  they just all have young kids,I good your friends don't have any older children. ,0,0,True,"step 1: in the premise, the speaker is asking if any of the friends have older children that they do things with. this implies that some friends might have older children and some might not. however, the premise does not provide definitive information about the number or percentage of friends with older children. step 2: the hypothesis states that 'i good your friends don't have any older children.' this contradicts the premise, as it asserts that none of the friends have older children, which is not explicitly stated in the premise. step 3: based on the logical analysis, the hypothesis cannot be inferred from the premise as it goes beyond the given information and makes an additional assumption."
6492,I'm sorry.,I'm glad.,0,0,True,"step 1: both sentences express apologies and emotions (sorry, glad). however, the meanings and logical implications are different. 'i'm sorry' conveys a sense of regret or apology, while 'i'm glad' expresses happiness or pleasure. step 2: the hypothesis 'i'm glad' cannot be logically inferred from the premise 'i'm sorry'. although emotions can change and people might be glad about something despite having apologized previously, there is no logical connection between the two statements. step 3: based on the lack of logical connection and the different meanings of the sentences, the hypothesis 'i'm glad' is not entailed by the premise 'i'm sorry'."
6493,It's easy to run a few prime head south to do some moonlight tradin' at th' border.,Head north on the interstate and you will find the street race.,0,0,True,"step 1: the premise describes a scenario of running a few prime heads (presumably people) southward to engage in moonlight trading at the border. the context suggests illegal activities. no explicit information is given about a street race. step 2: the hypothesis describes a different scenario involving a street race with no connection to the premise's scenario. the premise does not provide enough information to logically infer the existence of a street race. step 3: based on the given information, there is no entailment between the premise and the hypothesis."
6494,Jon paused for a moment before speaking.,Jon didn't resume what he was speaking about. ,0,0,True,"step 1: the premise describes jon pausing before speaking, indicating a break in his speech. it does not provide any information about whether or not he resumed speaking after the pause. common sense and logical principles suggest that a pause in speech does not necessarily mean that the speaker did not resume speaking, but it's also possible.step 2: the hypothesis states that jon didn't resume what he was speaking about, which is a stronger claim than the premise provides. the hypothesis goes beyond the information given in the premise and cannot be logically inferred from it.step 3: based on the given information, the hypothesis 'jon didn't resume what he was speaking about' is not entailed by the premise 'jon paused for a moment before speaking'. the premise is not sufficient to logically infer the hypothesis."
6495,"The public, by 80 percent or more, believes that he's committed perjury, chimed in Rep.",The Representative did not know what percentage of the public thought he perjured himself.  ,0,0,True,"step 1: the premise indicates that a large majority of the public believes that the representative committed perjury. perjury is the act of lying or giving false testimony in a court of law. step 2: the hypothesis states that the representative did not know what percentage of the public held this belief. this means that the representative was unaware of the extent of public opinion regarding his potential perjury. step  3: the hypothesis does not logically follow from the premise as the premise does not provide any information about the representative's knowledge or awareness of public opinion. the hypothesis contradicts the premise if we assume the representative cannot be unaware of the widespread belief about his perjury, but there is no clear logical connection between the two statements. step 4: based on the given information, the hypothesis is not entailed by the premise."
6496,"For special items, go inland to the place of manufacture, keeping in mind the prices asked on the coast and at Guadalest for ponchos and shawls; Gata for cane, basket work, and guitars; Crevillente for woven rugs and carpets; Jijona for turren; Ibi for toys.",One should go to sea for special items.,0,0,True,step 1. the premise provides a list of places to go and the specific items to find there. it does not mention going to the sea for any special items. step 2. the hypothesis suggests the opposite of what the premise states. the hypothesis is not logically related to or entailed by the premise. step 3. the hypothesis cannot be inferred from the premise as it provides information that contradicts the premise.
6497,aerobics yeah i like aerobics,I hate aerobics.,0,0,True,"step 1: in the premise, the speaker expresses a liking for aerobics. liking something implies a positive attitude or enjoyment towards it. step 2: in the hypothesis, the speaker is expressed to hate aerobics, which is the opposite of liking it. step 3: the hypothesis contradicts the information given in the premise, and it cannot be logically inferred from the premise as they state contradictory attitudes towards aerobics."
6498,"In other cases, we must rely on survey approaches to estimate WTP, usually through a variant of the contingent valuation approach, which generally involves directly questioning respondents for their WTP in hypothetical market situations.",It is not possible to determine WTP by asking respondents.,0,0,True,"step 1: the premise describes a common methodology used to estimate willingness to pay (wtp) in economic studies when other methods are not feasible. it emphasizes the use of surveys and the contingent valuation approach, which directly asks respondents for their wtp in hypothetical scenarios. step 2: the hypothesis states that it is not possible to determine wtp by asking respondents. this contradicts the premise, as the premise indicates that the methodology relies on doing exactly that. step 3: based on the logical contradiction between the premise and hypothesis, it is clear that the hypothesis cannot be logically inferred from the premise."
6500,They wonder whether Gary Bauer is strong enough to resist the urge.,They think that Gary might give into urges if prompted for very long.,1,1,True,"step 1: in the premise, 'they' express uncertainty about gary bauer's ability to resist an urge. this implies that there is a potential for gary to succumb to the urge, but it does not necessarily mean that he will. step 2: the hypothesis suggests that 'gary might give into urges if prompted for very long.' this is a possibility that is consistent with the premise, as it also implies that gary has the potential to resist for some period but may eventually yield. step 3: based on the logical consistency and the lack of contradictory information, the hypothesis can be inferred from the premise."
6501,1 ranking in the Forbes 400.,The second ranking in the Forbes 400.,0,1,False,"step 1: in the premise, we have information about an individual having a specific ranking, 1, in the forbes 400 list. this ranking indicates a high level of wealth and financial success. the forbes 400 is a list of the wealthiest people in america. no relevant logical connections, commonsense understanding, or factual inconsistencies are identified in the premise.step 2: the hypothesis suggests that the same individual (due to the lack of specification of a different individual) has a ranking one position higher in the forbes 400 list. this hypothesis is logically consistent with the premise as the ranking numbers suggest a progressive order. it is also a reasonable inference as an individual's wealth can change over time.step 3: based on the logical reasoning and lack of contradictory facts, the hypothesis can be inferred from the premise as it implies a progression in wealth rank, which is consistent with the information provided in the premise.step 4: since the hypothesis can be logically inferred from the premise and there are no contradictory facts, the hypothesis is entailed by the premise."
6502,The attempt was futile.,The attempt was successful. ,0,0,True,"step 1: the premise 'the attempt was futile' means that the attempt did not achieve its intended goal. step 2: the hypothesis 'the attempt was successful' contradicts the premise, as it suggests that the attempt did, in fact, achieve its goal. step 3: logically speaking, a failed attempt cannot entail a successful one. common sense also tells us that a futile attempt is by definition unsuccessful. therefore, the hypothesis 'the attempt was successful' cannot be logically inferred from the premise 'the attempt was futile'."
6503,"A man in a blue windbreaker jacket, laying face down on a park bench, with a liquor bottle nestled by one of the bench's legs.",A man is dancing at the club popping bottles.,0,0,True,"step 1. the premise describes a man in a blue windbreaker jacket, who is lying face down on a park bench with a liquor bottle nearby. this scene implies a situation of relaxation, possibly under the influence of alcohol. however, there is no indication of dancing or being at a club in the given information. step 2. the hypothesis suggests a completely different scenario, with a man dancing and popping bottles, which is not logically related to the premise. common sense and logical principles dictate that a man lying down on a park bench, drinking alcohol, is not entailed to be dancing at a club. step 3. based on the logical reasoning, the lack of connection between the premise and hypothesis, and the significant difference in the described scenes, the hypothesis is not entailed by the premise."
6504,"'I'll find out what the problem is,' I mumbled instead, leaving the cabin.",I decided to just stay in the cabin and leave someone else to figure out what the problem is. ,0,0,True,"step 1: in the premise, the speaker announces their intention to leave the cabin and find out what the problem is. this implies a sense of taking action to address the issue.step 2: in contrast, the hypothesis suggests that the speaker decided to stay in the cabin and let someone else figure out the problem. this contradicts the information in the premise, as the speaker is stated to have left the cabin with the intention of finding the problem.step 3: based on the given information, the hypothesis cannot be logically inferred from the premise, as the premise and hypothesis present contradictory actions."
6505,right holley yeah right,"No, not holley, no.",0,0,True,"step 1: in this case, both the premise and hypothesis are statements of denial with the same subject 'holley'. the premise is 'right holley yeah right' which could be interpreted as an affirmation followed by a confirmation, but without specific meaning. the hypothesis is 'no, not holley, no'. both statements reject the idea that 'holley' is being affirmed or is correct in some way.step 2: given that both the premise and hypothesis deny any affirmation of 'holley', they are equivalent in meaning. since the hypothesis does not add any new information to the premise, it is not logically inferred from the premise. however, they are logically consistent with each other.step 3: based on the given information, logical principles, and common-sense reasoning, there is no entailment between the premise and hypothesis."
6506,"Pal Dukagjini or Paul Ducagin (Italian: ""Paolo Ducagini"" , 1411–1458) was an Albanian nobleman, a member of the Dukagjini family.","Henry Purcell or Paul Ducagin (Italian: ""Paolo Ducagini"", 1411–1458) was an Albanian nobleman, a member of the Dukagjini family.",1,1,True,"step 1: both the premise and hypothesis describe a person named paul ducagini or paolo ducagini, who is an albanian nobleman and a member of the dukagjini family. the descriptions match exactly.step 2: the hypothesis is logically entailed by the premise because the information in the hypothesis is a subset of the information in the premise. in other words, the hypothesis can be derived from the premise by limiting the scope of the description to only the name and family affiliation.step 3: based on the logical relationship between the premise and hypothesis, the hypothesis is a logical entailment of the premise."
6507,"Yes, said Jon, looking at the big man.",Jon looked at the ground.,0,0,True,"step 1: the premise states that jon looked at the big man. this implies that jon's gaze was directed towards the man. there is no mention of jon looking at the ground.step 2: the hypothesis suggests a different object of jon's gaze, the ground. this is not logically inferred from the premise, as there is no mention of the ground in the premise.step 3: based on the given information, there is no entailment between the premise and hypothesis."
6508,"To determine if and why lawyers will stay with or leave public interest law, on February 8, 2002 the National Association for Public Interest Law (NAPIL) and the National Legal Aid and Defender Association will launch an online survey at //www.napil.org/ The survey is designed to gauge the level of the judicial and educational debt crises.",The survey's results will have major budget-related consequences.,1,1,True,"step 1: in the premise, we have a specific event of an online survey being launched by two organizations (napil and nlada) on a certain date to address the judicial and educational debt crises for lawyers in public interest law. this survey is accessible via a website. step 2: the hypothesis posits that the results of this survey will have significant budget-related consequences. the term 'budget-related consequences' suggests that the survey results will influence spending, possibly by revealing critical financial information. step 3: given that the survey is designed to gauge the level of the debt crises, it's reasonable to infer that the results will reveal important financial information about the lawyers' situation. this information could potentially lead to changes in budgets for public interest law, either by increasing funding to help alleviate the debt or by reducing it based on the findings. step 4: in this context, a major budget-related consequence can be reasonably inferred from the premise since the premise establishes a survey aimed at understanding a financial issue (debt crises) and the hypothesis suggests that the results of such a survey would have significant budget implications."
6509,"The landscape of the eastern peninsula, known as the Ponta de Sao Lourenco, is more like Porto Santo and the Ilhas Desertas than Madeira.",The landscape in Ponta de Sao Lourenco is much like Madeira.,0,0,True,"step 1: in the premise, the landscape of ponta de sao lourenco is described as being more similar to porto santo and the ilhas desertas than madeira. this implies that the landscape of ponta de sao lourenco shares more characteristics with these two places than madeira. none of this information contradicts the hypothesis.step 2: the hypothesis asserts that the landscape in ponta de sao lourenco is similar to madeira. while this is not explicitly stated in the premise, it is not logically inconsistent with it. the premise only establishes that ponta de sao lourenco is more similar to porto santo and the ilhas desertas than madeira, not that it is dissimilar to madeira.step 3: however, the hypothesis is not a logical entailment of the premise. the premise does not provide sufficient evidence to logically infer that the landscape of ponta de sao lourenco is similar to madeira, especially when it is stated to be more similar to porto santo and the ilhas desertas. common sense and logical reasoning suggest that the hypothesis is not a valid conclusion based on the given information in the premise.step 4: therefore, the hypothesis is not logically entailed by the premise."
6510,The young lady had far too much confidence in herself to pay any heed to them.,The young lady listened to every word they said.,0,0,True,"step 1: the premise indicates that the young lady had an excessive amount of self-confidence, causing her to disregard others' words. this implies a lack of attention or listening to them. step 2: the hypothesis suggests the opposite, that the young lady listened to every word they said. step 3: the hypothesis directly contradicts the premise, as the two statements cannot logically co-exist. therefore, the hypothesis cannot be inferred from the premise."
6511,"Yo I think White America Is messing up our mind whit all of this bullshit, claims one protester in a newsgroup.","One protester claimed White America is making troubles, but the newsman didn't listen to him.",1,0,False,"step 1: in the premise, a protester expresses their belief that white america is causing problems or making troubles. this is a statement of opinion or belief. the newsgroup context suggests an informal setting, where people share their thoughts and opinions.step 2: the hypothesis states that the newsman did not listen to the protester's claim. this is also a statement of opinion or belief, but it does not directly relate to the premise or contradict it. there is no logical connection between the premise and hypothesis.step 3: based on the given information, the hypothesis cannot be logically inferred from the premise. the hypothesis describes a different situation (the newsman not listening) that is not mentioned or implied in the premise (the protester's statement)."
6512,I think this lady is waiting for a cab.,The lady needs a ride.,1,1,True,"step 1: the premise describes the lady's behavior of presumably waiting for a taxi. waiting for a cab can be considered as an expression of needing a ride, as the ultimate goal is to travel from one place to another. step 2: the hypothesis 'the lady needs a ride' is logically entailed by the premise 'i think this lady is waiting for a cab'. this is because waiting for a cab is an action taken to acquire a ride. step 3: based on the logical connection between the premise and hypothesis, and the absence of contradictory information, the hypothesis can be inferred from the premise."
6513,Two Asian women are next to a table that has food on it.,The women are taking a nap.,0,0,True,"step 1: in the premise, we have the information that there are two asian women who are next to a table that has food on it. the presence of food does not necessarily imply that the women are taking a nap. there are other possible explanations such as they are eating, preparing food, or even cleaning up. common sense does not dictate that women next to a table with food automatically implies they are napping. step 2: the hypothesis 'the women are taking a nap' contradicts the premise because there is no information in the premise that supports the women are taking a nap. the hypothesis cannot be logically inferred from the premise. step 3: based on the lack of logical connection and the contradiction between the premise and hypothesis, the hypothesis cannot be inferred from the premise."
6514,Since March 2000 we received comments from a variety of organizations and individuals.,We have received comments and complaints from the multitude.,1,1,True,"step 1: in the premise, it is stated that comments have been received from various organizations and individuals since march 2000. this implies a significant number of commenters. step 2: the hypothesis, 'we have received comments and complaints from the multitude,' is synonymous with 'a great number of people have commented or complained to us.' this meaning is consistent with the information provided in the premise. step 3: since the hypothesis is a logical expansion based on the information in the premise and there is no contradiction, the hypothesis can be inferred from the premise."
6515,Jon stood and walked a short distance to relieve himself.,Jon decided to hold it in for a while longer.,0,0,True,"step 1: the premise describes an action of jon standing up and walking a short distance, which is typically associated with relieving oneself. however, it does not explicitly state that jon actually relieved himself. step 2: the hypothesis suggests that jon chose to not relieve himself and hold it in for a while longer. while the premise does not contradict this hypothesis, it does not logically entail it either, as the premise does not provide enough information to infer the reasoning behind jon's actions. step 3: based on the given information, the hypothesis cannot be logically inferred from the premise."
6516,"Recognizing that certain types of proposed service innovations merit consideration under specialized procedures, the Commission has adopted several sets of rules that are customized for defined categories of Postal Service requests.",Certain types of proposed service innovations should be considered by the USPS.,1,1,True,"step 1: the premise indicates that the commission has established specific procedures for considering certain types of proposed service innovations. this implies that the commission recognizes the importance of evaluating new service innovations, and that there are categories or types of requests that require more detailed or specialized consideration. step 2: the hypothesis, 'certain types of proposed service innovations should be considered by the usps,' is consistent with the information in the premise. the hypothesis suggests that there are categories of proposed service innovations that should receive attention from the usps, which aligns with the commission's actions described in the premise. step 3: based on the logical consistency and the common sense understanding that innovation is an important aspect of any organization's growth and development, the hypothesis can be inferred from the premise as it is a logical extension of the premise's content."
6517,"For example, as people live longer, rather than save more to finance more years of retirement, individuals could choose to work longer and postpone retirement.",Some people have much more money than others because of their saving.,1,0,False,"step 1: in the premise, it is mentioned that as people live longer, they might choose to work longer and postpone retirement instead of saving more. this implies that people's financial resources for retirement can come from two sources: savings and continued income from work. step 2: the hypothesis suggests that some people have much more money than others due to their saving. while saving is one way to accumulate wealth, it does not logically follow that this is the only way, or even the primary way, that some people have more money than others. there are other factors, such as inheritance, investments, or high-paying jobs, that can contribute significantly to wealth. step 3: based on the information provided, the hypothesis cannot be logically inferred from the premise, as the premise does not rule out other sources of wealth, such as income from work or investments.step 4: it's important to note that correlation does not imply causation. the fact that some people save more does not necessarily mean that they have more money due to their saving, but rather that they might have more money to save in the first place. therefore, the hypothesis does not follow logically from the premise, and there might be other explanations for why some people have more money than others.step 5: in conclusion, the hypothesis is not entailed by the premise, as the premise does not exclude other factors that can influence a person's wealth, such as income from work or investments."
6518,"The area has been developed with a number of hotels, notably Club Hotel La Mola, Formentera's most luxurious resort, Hotel Formentera Playa, and the Mar-y-land complex.",Hotel Formentera Playa is the most expensive resort in the Balearics.,1,0,False,"step 1: in the premise, it is mentioned that hotel formentera playa is one of the hotels in the developed area. no specific information about the prices of different hotels is provided, but the label suggests that hotel formentera playa is the most expensive one in the balearic islands. however, the premise itself doesn't directly provide this information. step 2: the hypothesis goes beyond the given information, as it makes a claim about the relative prices of this hotel compared to other resorts in the balearics. step 3: to determine if the hypothesis is entailed by the premise, we would need additional information about the prices of other resorts in the balearics or a statement indicating that hotel formentera playa is the most expensive one. in the absence of such information, the hypothesis cannot be logically inferred from the premise."
6519,"When we encounter the young woman again, she has taken a job as the live-in domestic at a huge and crumbling Roman townhouse belonging to an English loner named Jason Kinsky (David Thewlis).",The chances of finding jobs in the field of live-in domestics is low.,1,0,False,"step 1: in the premise, we learn that the young woman has taken a job as a live-in domestic at a roman townhouse. this implies that she was actively seeking employment in the field of live-ins domestics and was able to secure a position. however, the fact that she had to resort to such a position and that it belongs to an english loner named jason kinsky does not provide any specific information about the general availability or ease of finding such jobs in the market. step 2: the hypothesis, 'the chances of finding jobs in the field of live-in domestics is low', does not logically follow from the premise as there is no evidence or indication in the premise that the job market for live-in domestics is low or difficult. the premise only describes the young woman's specific employment situation. step 3: based on the given information, the hypothesis is not entailed by the premise."
6520,Exhibit 4 provides a list of the health effects for which we estimate quantified benefits as part of our analysis plus a list of the health effects for which we are unable to quantify benefits at this time.,"Exhibit 4 is not an exhaustive list, but it does cover a majority of the health benefits.",1,1,True,"step 1: the premise describes exhibit 4 as a list of health effects with some quantified benefits and others unquantified. it does not imply that the list covers every possible health benefit. step 2: the hypothesis suggests that while exhibit 4 may not be exhaustive, it still covers a significant portion of the health benefits. this interpretation is reasonable because a majority of health benefits could still make up a large and substantial portion of the total benefits, even if some benefits are missing. step 3: based on the given information and the reasonable interpretation of the hypothesis, it can be inferred that the hypothesis is not directly contradictory to the premise and could potentially be true. the hypothesis does not negate the premise but rather adds some nuance to our understanding of the scope of the list in exhibit 4.step 4: it's important to note that a hypothesis being non-contradictory to the premise does not necessarily imply entailment. however, given the context of this example and the reasonable interpretation of the hypothesis, it seems plausible that many of the missing health benefits may still be covered by the listed items, which would make the hypothesis generally true, and thus entailed by the premise.step 5: in conclusion, the hypothesis 'exhibit 4 is not an exhaustive list, but it does cover a majority of the health benefits' is a reasonable inference from the premise 'exhibit 4 provides a list of the health effects for which we estimate quantified benefits as part of our analysis plus a list of the health effects for which we are unable to quantify benefits at this time'."
6521,"Clinton's primary message--don't let the Republicans spend the surplus on tax cuts--didn't seem all that urgent, since it's not clear that even the House Republicans have a majority to do that.",Clinton was hoping that Republicans would make big tax cuts.,0,0,True,"step 1: in the premise, clinton is expressing concern that republicans might spend the budget surplus on tax cuts, but she seems nonchalant about this possibility due to uncertainty about the republicans' ability to secure a majority for such a move. step 2: the hypothesis suggests an opposite situation where clinton secretly wishes for the republicans to make big tax cuts. this is a contradiction to the premise as the premise indicates clinton's opposition to the tax cuts and a lack of urgency due to doubts about the republicans' ability to pass them. step 3: based on the logical analysis, the hypothesis cannot be inferred from the premise as they present contradictory information."
6522,well i guess that'll about do it,I think this will start it.,0,0,True,"step 1: both sentences appear to be expressing intentions or plans. the premise is written in a colloquial and informal way, indicating the speaker's intention to bring an activity to an end. the hypothesis suggests a starting point for a new activity. step 2: there is no direct contradiction or entailment between the two sentences. the hypothesis does not logically follow from the premise as presented. step 3: based on the given information, neither entailment nor contradiction can be inferred. the sentences describe different but potentially related actions, and the context provided does not allow for a definitive conclusion."
6523,He's entrepreneurial and enthusiastic.,He is a self-made businessman.,1,1,True,"step 1: being entrepreneurial and enthusiastic are qualities often associated with self-made businesspeople. they demonstrate an ability to identify opportunities and a strong drive to create and grow businesses. step 2: the hypothesis 'he is a self-made businessman' can be logically inferred from the premise, as the qualities mentioned are characteristic of this role. step 3: given the logical connection between the premise and hypothesis, and the fact that there is no contradictory information provided, the hypothesis can be inferred from the premise."
6525,I'd say they warn't even talkin' by th' time they pulled up here.,"By they time they got here, they were singing at the tops of their lungs.",0,0,True,"step 1: in the premise, 'they' are described as not talking by the time they arrived at a certain place. this implies a lack of verbal communication. no specific information is given about their singing or any other sounds they might be making. step 2: in contrast, the hypothesis asserts that 'they' were singing at the tops of their lungs by the time they got there. this is a clear contradiction to the premise, as singing is a form of vocal communication and the premise states that there was no talking. step 3: based on the logical contradiction between the premise and hypothesis, it is clear that the hypothesis cannot be inferred from the premise.step 4: it is important to note that the absence of evidence for something (in this case, singing) does not prove its absence. however, in this case, the presence of evidence for the opposite (lack of talking) does prove the absence of singing at the time in question according to the given information."
6526,"1952 Los líos de Elías "" 1954.","(1952) and ""Los líos de Elías"" (1954).",1,0,False,"step 1. the premise consists of two separate phrases, each referring to a novel titled 'los líos de elías' published in different years, 1952 and 1954. the hypothesis states that both titles refer to the same novel.step 2. to infer the hypothesis from the premise, i need to determine if there is sufficient evidence that the novels are identical. commonsense and logical reasoning do not directly provide an answer since the premise contains no explicit information regarding the content or plot similarities between the novels.step 3. however, the absence of contradictory evidence in the premise and the similarity in the title suggest a possibility of the novels being the same. in order to definitively answer this question, additional context, such as author, genre, or plot summary, would be required. without such information, it's impossible to determine if the hypothesis is logically entailed by the premise.step 4. since i cannot definitively infer the identity of the novels from the given information, the hypothesis is not logically entailed by the premise, and the label should be 0."
6527,There are several very well known parallels.,All parallels are unknown. ,0,0,True,"step 1: in the premise, 'several very well known parallels' refers to multiple examples or instances of similar situations or relationships. 'well known' signifies that these parallels are commonly recognized or familiar. step 2: the hypothesis, 'all parallels are unknown,' implies that none of these similarities or relationships are recognized or familiar. step 3: a logical contradiction exists between the premise and hypothesis, as the premise states 'well known parallels' while the hypothesis denies that any parallels are known. therefore, the hypothesis cannot be logically inferred from the premise. step 4: it's important to note that a hypothesis that contradicts the premise is not a valid inference, as it alters the meaning of the original statement.step 5: given the logical contradiction between the premise and hypothesis, it's safe to conclude that the hypothesis is not entailed by the premise."
6528,"In the organic standards rule, however, people submitted comments early in the process to have the greatest influence on the evolving discussion.",People gave their criticisms at the beginning of the process.,1,1,True,"step 1: in the premise, it is mentioned that people submitted comments 'early in the process' and that their comments had 'the greatest influence on the evolving discussion'. this implies that the comments were made at a crucial stage of the process, where they could shape the final outcome. step 2: the hypothesis suggests that people gave 'their criticisms' at the beginning of the process. this aligns with the information in the premise, as criticisms are indeed a type of comment and giving them at the beginning would allow for maximum influence. step 3: based on the logical connection between the premise and hypothesis, and the common sense understanding that giving criticisms at the beginning can influence the outcome, the hypothesis can be inferred from the premise.step 4: it is important to note that the premise does not necessarily mean that all comments were criticisms, but rather that the comments with the greatest influence were those made early in the process. however, the hypothesis focusing specifically on criticisms does not contradict the premise, as it is a subset of the comments mentioned in the premise.therefore, the hypothesis is a logical inference from the premise. "
6529,Stop blaming John.,John could be at fault but doesn't deserve blame.,1,0,False,"step 1: in the premise, there is a request to stop blaming john. this implies that there is an ongoing situation where john is being blamed for something. however, the premise itself does not provide any information about john's guilt or innocence. step 2: the hypothesis suggests that john might be at fault, but he doesn't deserve the blame. this statement does not contradict the premise, as the premise only asks to stop the blame and doesn't necessarily mean that john is innocent. step 3: based on the given information, the hypothesis is not logically entailed by the premise. the premise requests an action, while the hypothesis makes a statement about john's situation. while they are related, the hypothesis goes beyond the scope of the premise.step 4: in order to determine if the hypothesis can be logically inferred from the premise, we would need additional information about the situation and john's role in it. without that information, it is impossible to make a definitive conclusion.step 5: given the limited information provided, it appears that the hypothesis is not logically inferred from the premise."
6530,but uh that they uh are much more contentious so i i don't i i guess we'll have to see another generation to see what differences a child being brought up you know in in a uh kind of a uh community,"If I had to guess, I'd say that these communities aren't good for kids or anyone really.",1,0,False,step 1: the premise discusses the contentious nature of certain communities and suggests that the impact on children remains to be seen. it does not provide any definitive evidence or information about the harm caused to kids or anyone in these communities. step 2: the hypothesis makes a negative statement about the impact of these communities on children and people in general. it goes beyond the information provided in the premise and makes a stronger claim. step 3: the hypothesis cannot be logically inferred from the premise as the premise does not contain sufficient information to support the hypothesis. the hypothesis introduces new information and a negative evaluation not present in the premise.
6531,yeah so that's and that's what ours is our house the house we had before was over we live on the east side of Richardson now and the other one was over on the west side and it was uh a pier and beam house,"We live in Utah right now, and we love it.",0,0,True,"step 1. in the premise, the speakers mention that they used to live in a house on the east side of richardson, which was a pier and beam house, and now they live in another house in a different location. no specific information is given about the current location being in utah or any relation to the previous houses.step 2. the hypothesis makes a claim about the current location being in utah and the speakers loving it. there is no logical connection or inference to be made from the premise to the hypothesis as the premise does not provide any information about the current location or the speakers' feelings towards it.step 3. based on the given information, the hypothesis is not entailed by the premise."
6532,"That is not a Medicare or Medicaid cut, he reassured seniors.",He was worried they didn't believe him.,1,0,False,"step 1: the premise indicates that the speaker reassured seniors about something not being a cut to medicare or medicaid. it does not provide any information about why the speaker felt the need to reassure seniors or what their reaction was. the hypothesis suggests that the speaker was worried they didn't believe him.step 2: the hypothesis does not logically follow from the premise because the premise does not provide enough information to infer the speaker's feelings or thoughts. while it's possible that the speaker was worried seniors didn't believe him, the premise does not directly support that conclusion.step 3: based on the given information, the hypothesis cannot be logically inferred from the premise."
6533,to talk about well it was good talking to you um bye,Our discussion made me ponder a few things.,1,1,True,"step 1: in the premise, the speaker indicates that they had a good conversation and are now ending it. this implies that the conversation was productive and thought-provoking, as the speaker felt the need to express that it was 'good talking to you'. step 2: the hypothesis states that the conversation led the speaker to ponder a few things. this is a logical consequence of a productive and thought-provoking conversation. it is common sense that engaging in a deep or interesting conversation can lead one to contemplate new ideas or perspectives. step 3: based on the logical reasoning and common sense, the hypothesis can be inferred from the premise.step 4: it's also worth noting that the hypothesis doesn't contradict the premise in any way, as the speaker's pondering doesn't negate the fact that they had a good conversation."
6534,"Simmons, probably rap's greatest entrepreneur, lives in New York; schmoozes bankers, fashion designers, and record executives; and cuts deals with conglomerates such as Time Warner.",Simmons is known for dating New York's most prominent fashion designers. ,1,1,True,"step 1: the premise describes simmons as a successful entrepreneur in the rap industry who lives in new york and has connections with various influential people such as bankers, fashion designers, and record executives. it is common sense and logical that someone with such a prominent social and professional network in the fashion industry would have relationships with the industry's most prominent figures, including designers. step 2: the hypothesis suggests that simmons is known for dating new york's most prominent fashion designers, which is a logical consequence of his extensive social and professional network within the fashion industry in new york. step 3: based on the logical reasoning and common sense, the hypothesis can be inferred from the premise."
6535,"To monitor the effects of the new initiatives, Illinois will use random claims sampling to test the accuracy of the payments by reviewing 150 randomly selected claims per month, or 1,800 per year.",Illinois was been working for 7 months to implement these new initiatives.,1,0,False,"step 1: in the premise, illinois mentions that they will be reviewing 1,800 claims per year to monitor the effects of new initiatives. this indicates that the initiatives have been in place long enough for 1,800 claims to have been generated. however, the premise itself does not specify the duration since the implementation of these initiatives. step 2: the hypothesis suggests that the initiatives have been in place for 7 months. this is consistent with the information in the premise, as 1,800 claims could easily be generated over a 7-month period. step 3: based on the given information and the assumption that claims are generated consistently throughout the year, the hypothesis can be reasonably inferred from the premise.step 4: it's important to note that while the hypothesis can be inferred from the premise, the premise does not directly entail the hypothesis. the premise only provides the necessary conditions for the hypothesis to hold true, but it doesn't forcefully state that the initiatives have been in place for exactly 7 months.thus, the hypothesis is not logically entailed by the premise, but it is a reasonable inference based on the given information."
6536,um-hum oh that's good any other problems,I know there are no other problems.,0,0,True,"step 1: the premise is a simple affirmation with no clear meaning or logical relationships. it does not provide any specific information about problems or their absence. step 2: the hypothesis asserts that there are no other problems. it is not logically related to the premise as the premise does not convey any information about problems or their number. step 3: based on the lack of a logical connection, the hypothesis cannot be inferred from the premise."
6537,An African American wearing a red backpack looks the photographer as he walks past a concrete wall covered in graffiti.,a person wears a backpack,1,0,False,"step 1: in the premise, the individual's race, clothing color, and action of looking at the photographer are described. the hypothesis only mentions that a person wears a backpack. step 2: the premise does not directly entail the hypothesis, as the premise provides additional, irrelevant details about the race, clothing color, and location. however, the hypothesis is not contradictory to the premise, and it is possible for the person in the premise to be wearing a backpack. step 3: based on the given information, the hypothesis is not logically entailed by the premise, as the premise provides extraneous details that do not affect the truth of the hypothesis."
6538,oh so on on uh on some cards,"No, there aren't any cards. ",0,0,True,"step 1: in the premise, the words 'on some cards' suggest the presence of cards. however, the sentence structure and lack of specificity make it unclear how many cards there are or in what context they are being referred to. step 2: the hypothesis directly contradicts the premise, as it states that there are 'no, there aren't any cards.' step 3: based on the contradiction between the premise and hypothesis, the hypothesis cannot be inferred from the premise.step 3: the hypothesis is the negation of the premise, making it a contradiction. the absence of cards cannot be logically inferred from the presence of cards on some of them."
6539,Lobbying outfits roll out a carpet of gold.,The carpet of gold is very welcoming and a sign of wealth.,1,1,True,"step 1: the premise describes a metaphorical expression 'roll out a carpet of gold', which is often used figuratively to signify extravagant or excessive spending. this spending is typically done to welcome or impress, indicating a display of wealth. step 2: the hypothesis 'the carpet of gold is very welcoming and a sign of wealth' is consistent with the information in the premise as it emphasizes the welcoming nature and the wealth signified by the rolled-out gold. step 3: based on the logical consistency and common sense understanding of the given expressions, the hypothesis can be inferred from the premise."
6540,They then faced Everton in the quarter-final match but lost 5–0 at Goodison Park.,They then faced Everton in the quarter-final match but lost 5–1 at Goodison Park.,0,0,True,"step 1: in the premise, it is stated that 'they then faced everton in the quarter-final match but lost 5–0 at goodison park'. this implies that there was a football match between 'they' (an unspecified football team) and everton, and 'they' lost with a score of 5 goals against and 0 goals for. the hypothesis suggests a change in the score line, with 'they' losing 5–1 instead of 5–0.step 2: the hypothesis does not contradict the premise, as both statements describe a loss for 'they' against everton in the quarter-final match. however, the difference lies in the specifics of the score line. the hypothesis can be seen as a logical possibility if we consider that small errors or typos in reporting scores are common. additionally, it's important to note that the premise provides no explicit or implicit information about the number of goals scored by everton, which could have been the same or different in both statements.step 3: based on the logical reasoning, the lack of contradiction, and the common occurrence of small errors or typos in reporting scores, the hypothesis cannot be definitively ruled out as being entailed by the premise. however, it is also important to consider the degree of confidence we should place in this conclusion. since the premise and hypothesis differ only in a single detail (the number of goals for 'they'), and the premise is likely to be more reliable due to its greater specificity, it would be prudent to assume that the premise is the more accurate statement. as a result, the hypothesis is not entailed by the premise, but it is a possible alternative explanation for the same set of events."
6541,"The Fondation Angladon-Dubrujeaud (5 Rue Laboureur) presents an exceptional private art collection including many 19th- and 20th-century masterpieces by the likes of Picasso, C??zanne, Van Gogh, Modigliani, Manet, and Degas.",The collection is an exquisite one to see.,1,1,True,"step 1: the premise describes the fondation angladon-dubrujeaud as a private art collection with many masterpieces from renowned artists such as picasso, cezanne, van gogh, modigliani, manet, and degas. these are artists recognized for their exquisite work. step 2: the hypothesis 'the collection is an exquisite one to see' is a reasonable inference from the premise given that the presence of numerous masterpieces from esteemed artists implies an exceptional collection worth seeing. step 3: based on the logical reasoning and lack of contradictory information, the hypothesis 'the collection is an exquisite one to see' can be inferred from the premise."
6542,"A quarter century ago, Cooper sold the same kind of horror show to his teen fans as Manson does  a gender-bending female name, pancake makeup, raucous music, an onstage guillotine, and preposterous gross-out legends.","Cooper gave a calm, relaxed show for his teen fans.",0,0,True,"step 1: in the premise, cooper's show is described as having elements like gender-bending, pancake makeup, raucous music, an onstage guillotine, and preposterous gross-out legends. these elements suggest an energetic, edgy, and often disturbing performance. step 2: the hypothesis, 'cooper gave a calm, relaxed show for his teen fans,' contradicts the information provided in the premise, which describes cooper's show as anything but calm and relaxed. step 3: based on the logical negation of the elements described in the premise, the hypothesis cannot be logically inferred from the premise as they are in direct contradiction."
6543,"On a spur-road just a little north of the sleepy village of Anse-Bertrand is the Anse Laborde, a public beach of tan sand with gorgeous turquoise waters and good snorkeling off rocky promontories.",The Anse Labord beaches are popular for snorkeling due to their unique temperate reefs.,1,1,True,"step 1: the premise describes the anse laborde beach as having good snorkeling off rocky promontories. this implies that there are unique underwater features suitable for snorkeling. step 2: the hypothesis states that the anse laborde beaches are popular for snorkeling due to their unique temperate reefs. this is a logical inference from the premise, as the presence of unique temperate reefs would indeed make the beaches popular for snorkeling. step 3: based on the logical connection between the premise and hypothesis, and the common sense understanding that unique features would make a location popular for a specific activity, the hypothesis is entailed by the premise."
6544,"Two major festivals, Assumption Day on 15 August and Annunciation Day on 25 March, see thousands of believers crawling up the hill from the port to worship the icon.",In addition to worshiping the icon the believers will pray too.,1,1,True,"step 1. the premise describes a religious event, the assumption day and annunciation day festivals, where thousands of believers crawl up the hill to worship the icon. worshiping an icon is a common religious practice that involves showing reverence and devotion towards a sacred object.step 2. praying is another common religious practice that involves communicating with a deity or higher power, expressing gratitude, asking for guidance or protection, or seeking forgiveness. the premise mentions 'believers' who are participating in a religious event, and it is a logical assumption that they would engage in various religious practices, including both worshiping the icon and praying.step 3. based on the logical reasoning and the lack of contradiction, the hypothesis is entailed by the premise. the religious practices of worshiping the icon and praying are interconnected aspects of the believers' faith."
6545,"And they refuse to pay for the wedding, as they do not approve of me.",My parents and I understand each other perfectly. ,0,0,True,"step 1: the premise states that my parents refuse to pay for my wedding because they do not approve of me. this implies a disagreement or misunderstanding between the speaker and their parents regarding the wedding.step 2: the hypothesis, 'my parents and i understand each other perfectly', contradicts the premise. if my parents and i understood each other perfectly, there would be no disagreement about the wedding or their refusal to pay for it.step 3: based on the logical reasoning and the contradiction between the premise and hypothesis, the hypothesis is not entailed by the premise."
6546,"You should always pay attention to your instincts.""",Your instincts are usually correct.,1,1,True,"step 1: in the premise, 'paying attention to your instincts' is presented as a piece of advice, suggesting that instincts can provide valuable information or guidance. this implies that instincts have some level of accuracy or reliability. step 2: the hypothesis, 'your instincts are usually correct', directly relates to the premise by stating that instincts are generally accurate. this is a reasonable inference based on the information in the premise. step 3: the hypothesis is a logical extension of the premise, as the premise implies that instincts are reliable and the hypothesis states that they are usually correct. step 4: there are no known facts or logical principles that contradict the hypothesis, as it aligns with common sense and the premise. step 5: based on the logical reasoning, common sense, and lack of contradictory facts, the hypothesis is entailed by the premise."
6547,"The Midnighters as a "" group "" were inducted into the Roll Hall of Fame on April 14, 2012.","The Midnighters as a ""group"" were inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame on April 14, 2012.",1,1,True,"step 1: in the premise, it is stated that the midnighters were inducted into the roll hall of fame on a specific date. the term 'roll hall of fame' is synonymous with 'rock and roll hall of fame' as both refer to the same institution. there are no contradictions or inconsistencies in the given information.step 2: the hypothesis is identical to the premise, except for the explicit mention of 'rock and roll'. since 'roll hall of fame' is understood to mean 'rock and roll hall of fame' in the premise, the hypothesis is already implied and can be logically inferred from it.step 3: given the identical meaning of 'roll hall of fame' and 'rock and roll hall of fame', the hypothesis is a specific instance of the premise, and thus, is logically entailed by it."
6548,and um a lot of people just just wear jeans and and uh sweats all the time and they dress up like when customers are coming in or uh when we have department meetings or something like that and um,"A lot of people wear jeans or sweats to work, but my office has a strict dress code.",1,0,False,"step 1: in the premise, it is stated that a lot of people wear jeans and sweats as their regular attire at work. however, they also dress up for specific occasions like customer visits or department meetings. this implies that there is a flexible dress code at their workplace. in the hypothesis, it is mentioned that people wear jeans and sweats to work, but there is a strict dress code in your office.step 2: the hypothesis does not logically follow from the premise as the premise does not provide enough information about the existence or non-existence of a strict dress code in all workplaces. the hypothesis introduces a new and contradictory element (strict dress code) that is not present or implied in the premise.step 3: based on the information provided, the hypothesis cannot be inferred from the premise as it contradicts the flexibility implied in the premise regarding work attire."
6549,"Miss Wheeler, 43 Clapington Road, Battersea.",44 Clapington Road is unoccupied.,1,0,False,"step 1: in the premise, miss wheeler's address is given as 43 clapington road. no information is provided about the occupancy of 44 clapington road. step 2: the hypothesis, '44 clapington road is unoccupied', makes a statement about the occupancy status of a different address. the premise does not provide any logical connection or information that directly infers the occupancy status of 44 clappington road. step 3: based on the given information, the hypothesis '44 clapington road is unoccupied' cannot be logically inferred from the premise 'miss wheeler, 43 clapington road, battersea'."
6550,The formal fish market is farther along the fascinating canalside Boulevard Allygre.,There is also a produce market.,1,0,False,"step 1: in the premise, we have information about the location of a formal fish market along the boulevard allygre. no information is provided about other types of markets in the area. step 2: the hypothesis introduces the existence of a produce market in the same location. while the premise does not explicitly mention a produce market, it does not contradict the hypothesis either. there is no factual reason to believe that a produce market cannot coexist with a fish market in the same location. step 3: based on the lack of contradiction and the possibility of coexistence, the hypothesis cannot be logically ruled out based on the premise alone. however, it also does not follow logically from the premise as there is no direct evidence for the presence of a produce market in the premise. step 4: therefore, the hypothesis is neither entailed nor contradicted by the premise, but it is also not an unreasonable assumption given the lack of contradictory evidence."
6551,"Venice and its Repubblica Serena rebounded to turn to the mainland, extending its Veneto territory from Padua across the Po valley as far as Bergamo.",Venice did not have a vast amount of territory.,0,0,True,"step 1: in the premise, venice is described as rebounding and extending its veneto territory from padua across the po valley to bergamo. this indicates that venice had control over a significant amount of land. step 2: the hypothesis, 'venice did not have a vast amount of territory,' contradicts the information provided in the premise. the hypothesis cannot be logically inferred from the premise. step 3: based on the given premise, the hypothesis is not entailed."
6552,Katherine tried to seek help through the courts.,Katherine needed information about her father's estate from the probate court. ,1,1,True,"step 1: seeking help through the courts can imply various reasons, one of which is seeking information or resolution regarding an estate matter, such as a probate case. the probate court deals specifically with estate matters. step 2: the hypothesis suggests a specific reason for katherine's court action – seeking information about her father's estate. this reason is not contradictory to the premise, as trying to seek help through the courts for this purpose is a valid reason for taking such an action. step 3: based on the logical connection between the premise and hypothesis, and the common sense understanding of the roles and functions of courts and probate courts, the hypothesis can be reasonably inferred from the premise.step 4: it is also important to note that the premise does not limit or exclude the possibility of katherine's court action being related to seeking information about her father's estate, so the hypothesis does not contradict the premise. therefore, the hypothesis can be considered entailed by the premise."
6553,"Named after the 13th-century college established by Robert deaSorbon for poor theological students, the university was later taken in hand by Cardinal Richelieu, who financed its reconstruction (1624-1642).",Cardinal Richelieu took the university in hand because he needed to make a political move against the other papal candidates.,1,0,False,"step 1: in the premise, we have the information that cardinal richelieu took the university in hand for financing its reconstruction around 1624-1642. this factual information sets the context. step 2: the hypothesis suggests a reason for richelieu's involvement being a political move against other papal candidates. while the premise does not directly provide this information, there is no contradiction between the two statements. richelieu's reasons for involvement could be multiple, and the premise does not exclude this possibility. step 3: the hypothesis, while not logically entailed by the premise, is not contradictory to it, and common sense does not dictate otherwise. historically, political motivations for financing educational institutions were common, and richelieu's actions could have been driven by multiple reasons, including political gain. therefore, the hypothesis is not logically entailed by the premise, but it is plausible based on common historical knowledge."
6554,"Even then, we almost failed.","With no preparation at all, we still had an easy victory.",0,0,True,"step 1: in the premise, 'even then, we almost failed' implies that despite certain circumstances, the outcome was close to not being successful. it does not provide information about the cause of the near failure or the nature of the victory. in the hypothesis, 'with no preparation at all' indicates a complete lack of readiness or planning. step 2: the hypothesis contradicts the premise because a lack of preparation would typically make achieving an 'easy victory' unlikely due to the challenges and unexpected obstacles that could arise. step 3: based on the logical reasoning, it is clear that the hypothesis is not entailed by the premise as they present contradictory information."
6555,Two boys are holding red kites with water in the background.,Two boys are watching television.,0,0,True,"step 1: in the premise, we have the information that there are two boys and they are holding red kites. the background has water. this information does not logically imply or suggest that the boys are watching television. there is no mention of a television or any context that would suggest television watching. step 2: the hypothesis, 'two boys are watching television', is not logically inferred from the premise, as there is no information in the premise that supports the idea of television watching. step 3: based on the given information, there is no entailment relationship between the premise and the hypothesis."
6556,"SO2 and NOx contribute to acid deposition, which damages lakes and streams, adversely affecting the fish and other species that live in them, and leaches nutrients from the soil.",SO2 is more dangerous to lakes than NOx is.,1,0,False,"step 1: both so2 and nox are pollutants that contribute to acid deposition, which harms aquatic ecosystems and soil. the premise does not directly compare the individual impacts of so2 and nox on lakes and streams. however, it is a common understanding that acid deposition in general is detrimental to these environments.step 2: the hypothesis asserts that so2 is more dangerous to lakes than nox. this statement requires us to compare the relative harms of so2 and nox to lakes. however, the premise does not provide sufficient information to make a definitive conclusion about this comparison.step 3: based on the given information, the hypothesis cannot be logically inferred from the premise. while both so2 and nox contribute to acid deposition, the premise does not provide enough evidence to determine that so2 is more harmful than nox to lakes specifically."
6557,"By marrying his daughters to sons of the reigning emperor and then engineering timely abdications, a Fujiwara contrived always to be father-in-law, uncle, or grandfather behind the throne.",The only way the Fujiwara could lose their seat at the throne was through war.,1,0,False,"step 1: in the premise, the fujiwara is described as using strategic marriages and abdications to maintain a position of power behind the throne. this is a political maneuver and does not involve any conflict or war. step 2: the hypothesis suggests that the only way for the fujiwara to lose their seat at the throne is through war. this is a contradiction to the information given in the premise, as the premise does not suggest or imply that the fujiwara's power was ever threatened or lost due to war. step 3: based on the information given in the premise, the hypothesis cannot be logically inferred, as the two statements contradict each other."
6558,Athens died last year.,Athens is not doing well.,1,0,False,"step 1: the premise states that athens died last year. this means athens no longer exists. inferring 'not doing well' from 'dead' requires a different meaning of 'doing well', which could refer to being in good health or prosperous state. however, since athens is deceased, we cannot determine 'not doing well' based on the given information. step 2: 'not doing well' cannot be logically inferred from 'athens died last year' as the two statements describe different concepts. the first statement indicates that athens no longer exists, while the second statement suggests a condition or state. step 3: based on the logical analysis and the lack of a direct connection between the premise and hypothesis, the hypothesis cannot be inferred from the premise."
6559,and it's it's really really pretty and um  green it stayed pretty pretty green throughout the winter and uh and it's pretty good it's not as thick and as nice it doesn't look like it can withstand too much you know,I found it really really ugly throughout the winter.,0,0,True,"step 1. in the premise, the speaker is describing a green object that stayed green throughout the winter, acknowledging its beauty but also pointing out its lack of thickness and ability to withstand much. this description does not provide any direct information about the speaker's feelings or opinions about the object.step 2. the hypothesis asserts that the speaker found the object ugly throughout the winter. this is not logically entailed by the premise, as the premise never directly states or implies the speaker's opinion.step 3. based on the given information, the hypothesis cannot be inferred from the premise as it presents an opinion that contradicts the implied admiration for the object's ability to stay green in the premise.step 4. in the absence of sufficient information to infer the speaker's opinion from the premise, we cannot logically infer the hypothesis from the premise."
6560,But to accept would give him a slight chance to prove he could do part of the work.,Accepting meant he would never prove he was capable of doing the work. ,0,0,True,"step 1: the premise describes a situation where accepting an offer would give someone a slight chance to prove their abilities. the hypothesis suggests that accepting would mean they would never be able to prove their capabilities. step 2: the hypothesis contradicts the premise by suggesting that accepting would lead to an outcome (never proving capabilities) that is the opposite of what the premise implies (having a slight chance to prove capabilities). step 3: based on the logical contradiction between the two statements, the hypothesis cannot be logically inferred from the premise."
6561,"SUBSIDY COST -The cost of a grant of financial aid, usually by a governmental body, to some person or institution for particular purposes.",90% of subsidy costs are made by governmental bodies.,1,0,False,"step 1: the premise defines what a subsidy cost is - the cost of a grant of financial aid, usually provided by a governmental body. no specific percentage of these costs is mentioned in the premise. common sense and logical understanding of the term 'subsidy' suggest that governments are often the primary providers of these funds. however, the premise does not explicitly state that 100% of subsidy costs are made by governmental bodies.step 2: the hypothesis, stating that 90% of subsidy costs are made by governmental bodies, is a quantifiable claim about the proportion of costs coming from governmental bodies. it implies that there are some subsidy costs that do not originate from governmental bodies, but the hypothesis does not specify the source or proportion of those costs.step 3: while it is common for governments to provide a significant portion of subsidy costs, the hypothesis goes beyond the information provided in the premise. the premise neither explicitly nor implicitly justifies the statement that 90% of subsidy costs are made by governmental bodies. therefore, based on the information given, the hypothesis cannot be logically inferred from the premise.step 4: it is important to note that the hypothesis may still be factually true, but it cannot be logically inferred from the given premise alone."
6562,Sheep farmers are crouching and preparing to feed their animals as the sheepdog watches closely by.,Farmers plant their corn as a scarecrow watches closely by.,0,0,True,"step 1: in the premise, sheep farmers are engaging in the activity of feeding their sheep. this involves preparing and distributing food to the animals. the sheepdog is present and watching closely, likely helping to herd or protect the sheep. no information is given about planting crops or the presence of a scarecrow.step 2: in the hypothesis, farmers are planting their corn, an entirely different activity from feeding sheep. a scarecrow is present and watching closely by. the presence of farmers and a watchful figure are common in both scenarios, but the specific actions and contexts are distinct.step 3: based on the information provided, there is no logical connection between the premise and the hypothesis. the hypothesis cannot be inferred from the premise as they describe unrelated situations."
6563,"Non - English - speaking nations often use the rank of flotilla admiral as an equivalent, although counter admiral may also correspond to rear admiral.","Non-English-speaking nations often use the rank of flotilla admiral or counter admiral or senior captain as an equivalent, although counter admiral may also correspond to rear admiral.",1,1,True,"step 1: in the premise, we have information about non-english-speaking nations using the ranks of flotilla admiral and counter admiral as equivalents. the context suggests that these ranks may serve similar functions in their respective navies. the term 'counter admiral' is mentioned to have correspondence with 'rear admiral' in english-speaking navies.step 2: the hypothesis extends the premise by including the rank of 'senior captain' as another potential equivalent rank in non-english-speaking navies. this addition does not contradict the premise, as it does not change the original information about flotilla admiral and counter admiral.step 3: the hypothesis can be logically inferred from the premise since it builds upon the existing information by adding a related detail. it is a reasonable extension, and there is no contradiction or conflict with the premise."
6564,"A man in a bear suit, holding the head of the costume in his hand, stands at the back of a crowd.",man in bear suit,1,1,True,"step 1: in the premise, a man is described as being in a bear suit and holding the head of the costume. this implies that the man is wearing a bear costume. the hypothesis also mentions a man in a bear suit. step 2: the hypothesis can be logically inferred from the premise because the premise establishes that the man is wearing a bear suit, and the hypothesis repeats that information. step 3: based on the logical consistency and simple repetition of the man in a bear suit in both the premise and hypothesis, the hypothesis is entailed by the premise."
6565,a lot of places do that now they'll they'll set aside you know like an hour a day that you can go exercise,You are unlikely to be able to get out of your chair much after starting on the clock.,0,0,True,"step 1: in the premise, it is mentioned that 'a lot of places' have set aside an hour a day for exercise. this implies a structured environment where people are encouraged to engage in physical activity. the hypothesis, 'you are unlikely to be able to get out of your chair much after starting on the clock', seems to suggest that the exercise session may be so intensive or time-consuming that participants might have difficulty moving around or standing up afterwards.step 2: while the premise does not directly imply the hypothesis, it does not contradict it either. in fact, the hypothesis could be a possible outcome of the exercise session described in the premise, depending on the specific nature and intensity of the exercises being conducted.step 3: based on the given information, the hypothesis cannot be definitively proven or disproven from the premise alone. however, the hypothesis is not in direct contradiction with the premise, and it is a plausible outcome in some scenarios. therefore, the degree of entailment is not clear-cut.step 4: since the hypothesis is neither a logical consequence of the premise nor a contradiction, it is important to clarify that the label '0' for no entailment does not necessarily mean that the hypothesis is false, but rather that it cannot be logically derived from the premise alone. the actual truth or falsity of the hypothesis would depend on additional context or specific details about the exercise sessions in question."
6566,yeah well we're feeding starving kids overseas but we're not paying any attention to the ones that are starving next door you know it's really sad,We wait until we've fed the kids next door before giving foreign aid.,0,0,True,"step 1: in the premise, there is a statement about providing aid to starving kids overseas, but at the same time, acknowledging the existence of starving kids next door. the statement implies a sense of neglect towards the local kids. step 2: the hypothesis suggests a different course of action, prioritizing feeding the local starving kids before providing foreign aid. this hypothesis is not necessarily contradictory to the premise, as it could represent a change in policy aimed at addressing the issue of local hunger before addressing hunger in other countries. step 3: however, the premise itself does not provide sufficient information to logically infer the hypothesis. the premise mentions the current situation of neglecting the local kids while providing aid overseas, but it does not indicate any intention or policy regarding the order of addressing hunger in different locations. therefore, the hypothesis cannot be logically inferred from the premise."
6567,34th Squadron specialized in very low level air space penetration (100–200 meters altitude) to hug the ground in order to evade enemy radars and fighter interceptions.,34th Squadron specialized in very low level air space penetration (100–200 meters altitude) to hug the ground in order to evade ally radars and fighter interceptions.,0,1,False,"step 1: in the premise, it is stated that 34th squadron specialized in very low level air space penetration (100–200 meters altitude) to hug the ground in order to evade enemy radars and fighter interceptions. this indicates a tactic used by the 34th squadron to survive in a hostile environment. the reason for hugging the ground is to make it harder for enemy radars and interceptors to detect them. no contradictory facts are given in the premise.step 2: the hypothesis suggests a similar scenario, but with 'ally radars and fighter interceptions' instead of 'enemy radars and fighter interceptions'. the tactic of hugging the ground to evade detection is the same in both cases. there's no information provided in the premise that contradicts the hypothesis, as the 34th squadron's tactics could be applied to evading allies as well as enemies.step 3: based on logical reasoning, lack of contradictory facts, and the similarity between the premise and hypothesis, the hypothesis can be inferred from the premise."
6569,"For example, a broader saving and investment measure might encompass spending on education as well as research and development.",They wanted to have the funds spent evenly between the causes.,1,1,True,"step 1: in the premise, a broader saving and investment measure is described as including spending on education and research and development. this implies that resources are being allocated to multiple causes. step 2: the hypothesis suggests that the funds were spent evenly between the causes. this is a reasonable inference, as both education and research and development are mentioned in the premise as part of the broader saving and investment measure, and neither is given any particular emphasis or priority. step 3: the hypothesis can be logically inferred from the premise, as the premise sets up the context for an even distribution of funds between multiple causes, and the hypothesis simply specifies that the distribution was even."

6571,"The final medal tally was led by Indonesia, followed by host Malaysia.","The final medal tally was led by Indonesia, followed by host Malaysia and Thailand.",1,0,False,"step 1: in the premise, it is stated that indonesia led the final medal tally, and malaysia came in second. no information is given about any other countries' medal counts. step 2: in the hypothesis, it is stated that indonesia led the final medal tally, followed by malaysia and thailand. the addition of thailand in the hypothesis does not contradict the information in the premise as it only adds an extra country with a medal count. step 3: the hypothesis is not logically inferred from the premise, but it is not contradictory either. the hypothesis extends the information in the premise by adding an additional detail about another country's medal count. it is a valid extension if thailand indeed finished third in the medal tally. step 4: in conclusion, the hypothesis is not logically inferred from the premise but is a valid extension based on the given information."
6572,"IDPA's OIG's mission is to prevent, detect, and eliminate fraud, waste, abuse, and misconduct in various payment programs.",IDPA's OIG's mission took 3 days to be written.,1,0,False,"step 1: in the premise, idpa's oig's mission is defined as preventing, detecting, and eliminating fraud, waste, abuse, and misconduct in various payment programs. this is a clear statement of the objectives and responsibilities of the idpa's office of inspector general (oig). no details about the origin or duration of this mission statement are provided.step 2: the hypothesis, on the other hand, makes a different type of statement, describing a duration of 3 days for writing the mission statement. this information is not logically related to or entailed by the premise.step 3: based on the provided information, there is no logical connection between the premise and hypothesis. the hypothesis cannot be inferred from the premise.step 4: it's important to note that the hypothesis, as stated, is factually incorrect as the premise does not provide any information about the duration taken to write the idpa's oig mission statement."
6573,"Horses to be found back in the rough country, hidden away in the maze of pocket canyons where there was water and enough browning grass to keep them from straying.",In the maze of pocket canyons there is a drought and sandy ground with no vegetation. ,0,0,True,"step 1: in the premise, horses are described as being hidden away in the maze of pocket canyons where there is water and enough browning grass to keep them from straying. this implies that the horses are in this location due to the availability of water and some vegetation. however, it does not explicitly state that there is an abundance of water or lush vegetation.step 2: the hypothesis suggests that in the maze of pocket canyons, there is a drought and sandy ground with no vegetation. this contradicts the information in the premise, as the presence of horses implies that there is at least some vegetation and water, albeit browning.step 3: based on the given information, the hypothesis is not entailed by the premise as it contradicts the key relationship identified in the premise, which is the presence of horses and water/vegetation in the pocket canyons."
6574,"A third partition crushed Poland and placed the country under the control of Austria, Prussia, and Russia.",Poland remained autonomous.,0,0,True,"step 1: in the premise, poland is stated to have been crushed and placed under the control of austria, prussia, and russia. this implies that poland lost its sovereignty and independence, and foreign powers gained control over its political affairs. step 2: the hypothesis, stating that poland remained autonomous, is in direct contrast to the premise. the concept of autonomy implies the retention of self-governance and freedom from external control. step 3: the hypothesis cannot be logically inferred from the premise as it contradicts the information provided in the premise. the premise describes a historical fact where poland was partitioned and lost its independence, while the hypothesis proposes a contradictory scenario where poland remained autonomous."
6575,On the good nights no one died.,Good nights were nights they used their best weapons.,1,0,False,"step 1: in the premise, 'good nights' are described as nights when no one died. this does not provide any direct information about the use or type of weapons. step 2: the hypothesis suggests that 'good nights' were nights they used their best weapons. this is not a logical deduction that can be made from the given premise. in fact, the hypothesis contradicts the information provided in the premise, as the use or quality of weapons has no known causal relationship with no deaths occurring. step 3: based on the given information, the hypothesis cannot be logically inferred from the premise, as they describe different concepts."

",0,0,True,"step 1: in the premise, it is stated that almost all rooms in the lake district are priced according to a b and b rate, per person, with an additional fee for individuals traveling alone. this suggests a general pricing structure for rooms in the lake district. step 2: the hypothesis states that individuals traveling alone often receive a discounted room rate in the lake district bed and breakfast area. this is a contradictory statement to the premise, as the premise implies a higher fee for individuals traveling alone, not a discount. however, it's important to note that the premise does not explicitly state that the fee is a penalty or surcharge, and it's common for some establishments to offer discounts or promotions to certain groups, including solo travelers, to attract business. step 3: while the hypothesis cannot be logically inferred from the premise as stated, it's not impossible that the hypothesis could be true based on additional context or information not provided in the premise. for example, if it is common practice or policy among some b and bs in the lake district to offer discounted rates to solo travelers as a way to attract business, then the hypothesis could be true. however, without further information, the hypothesis cannot be definitively determined to be entailed by the premise."
6577,People are pulling a big green tractor.,The tractor is small and red.,0,0,True,"step 1. in the premise, 'people are pulling a big green tractor', the key information is that 'people are pulling a tractor' and 'the tractor is big and green'. no logical connections or commonsense understanding contradict this information. step 2. the hypothesis 'the tractor is small and red' contradicts the premise as the tractor is described as 'big' and 'green'. step 3. based on the logical reasoning, common sense, and factual consistency, the hypothesis 'the tractor is small and red' cannot be inferred from the premise 'people are pulling a big green tractor' as they are incompatible."
6578,waterfront property here at Love Canal you know,There's a waterfront property at Love Canal that costs $5million.,1,0,False,"step 1: the premise describes a location called love canal that is associated with waterfront property. it does not provide any specific information about the cost of any particular waterfront property at love canal. step 2: the hypothesis proposes that there is a waterfront property at love canal that costs $5 million. this is a possible situation based on the given premise, as the premise does not exclude the possibility of high-priced waterfront properties at love canal. however, it does not logically follow from the premise. step 3: based on the given information, the hypothesis cannot be logically inferred from the premise."
6580,and they had people out there using all sorts of drugs handling those chemicals,No one who used drugs ever worked with chemicals.,0,0,True,"step 1: in the premise, it is stated that 'they had people out there using all sorts of drugs' and 'handling those chemicals'. this implies that there are individuals who were using drugs while handling chemicals. step 2: the hypothesis, 'no one who used drugs ever worked with chemicals', states that no individual who used drugs has ever worked with chemicals. this is a contradiction to the premise, as the premise states that there were people who both used drugs and worked with chemicals. step 3: based on the logical negation of the hypothesis in relation to the premise, the hypothesis is not entailed by the premise."
6581,so and i like that because you can find out the good schools in your area,You can use the internet to find good schools.,1,1,True,"step 1: in the premise, the speaker expresses a reason for liking 'so' - they can find out about good schools in their area. this implies that there is a method for discovering this information. step 2: the hypothesis suggests an alternative method for discovering information about good schools - using the internet. step 3: the hypothesis can be logically inferred from the premise because both statements concern finding good schools, and the hypothesis provides an additional, complementary method for doing so. the premise does not limit the means of discovering good schools to any one method, so the hypothesis is consistent with the premise. step 4: in today's society, using the internet to find information about schools, or any other topic, is a common and sensible approach. therefore, the hypothesis is a reasonable inference from the premise."
6582,to the pop audience i guess you'd call it that,"To the oldies music listeners, you are probably right.",0,1,False,"step 1: both the premise and hypothesis contain the phrase 'you are probably right' followed by a description of a group of people. the difference lies in the descriptions of these groups - 'pop audience' in the premise and 'oldies music listeners' in the hypothesis. step 2: given that the phrase 'you are probably right' implies agreement or acknowledgement of a statement, and the descriptions of the two groups do not contradict each other, the hypothesis can be considered a restatement or a more specific version of the premise. that is, if the statement is true for the pop audience, it would also be true for the oldies music listeners, as both are groups of music listeners. step 3: based on the logical equivalence of the two statements, the hypothesis can be inferred from the premise.step 4: it is also important to note that the common idiom 'to the x audience' is used to refer to the response or reaction of a specific group of people towards certain music, events, or ideas. therefore, the hypothesis does not introduce any new or contradictory information.therefore, the hypothesis is logically entailed by the premise."
6583,"We're meant to feel that we're coming to the end of the line, an impression confirmed in Domenico Gnoli's painting of an empty table covered with a lace tablecloth, Without a Still Life (1966), placed toward the end of the show and chosen for the cover of the catalog.",Gnoli painted an empty table late at night.,1,0,False,"step 1: in the premise, it is mentioned that domenico gnoli's painting 'without a still life' gives an impression of the end, and the painting is placed toward the end of the show and used for the catalog cover. this information does not provide any specific details about when or why the painting was created, let alone any information about the time of day.step 2: the hypothesis suggests that the painting was created late at night. while no clear logical connection can be drawn between the premise and the hypothesis based on the provided information, it is important to note that the premise does not contradict the hypothesis.step 3: the absence of any clear logical connection or contradiction between the premise and the hypothesis means that the hypothesis cannot be logically inferred from the premise. the premise only describes the context and significance of the painting in the exhibition, while the hypothesis makes an assumption about the time of day when the painting was created. without additional information, it is not reasonable to infer one from the other.step 4: based on the logical reasoning and the absence of contradictory information, the hypothesis is not entailed by the premise."
6584,"There is very little left of old Ocho  the scant remains of Ocho Rios Fort are probably the oldest and now lie in an industrial area, almost forgotten as the tide of progress has swept over the town.",You can visit the remains of the Ocho Rios Fort.,1,1,True,"step 1: the premise describes the current state of ocho rios fort, stating that there is very little left of it and it lies in an industrial area. however, it also mentions that these remains are 'probably the oldest' and that they are 'almost forgotten'. this implies that while the fort is located in an industrial area and is not currently a major tourist attraction, it still exists and can be found. step 2: the hypothesis suggests that one can visit the remains of the ocho rios fort. this is a logical inference from the premise, as the premise states that the remains 'lie' in the industrial area, which implies they are accessible. step 3: based on the logical reasoning and the information provided in the premise, the hypothesis can be inferred from the premise."
6585,A girl and two boys are playing in water.,The children are eating dinner at a restaurant.,0,0,True,"step 1: in the premise, we have information about three children (one girl and two boys) engaging in an activity in water. there's no specific context or detail about what they are doing or why they are in the water. the hypothesis, however, describes a completely different situation, that of eating dinner at a restaurant.step 2: the hypothesis cannot be logically inferred from the premise. the activities described in each sentence are not related. eating dinner at a restaurant is not a reasonable or necessary consequence of playing in water.step 3: based on the logical analysis, the hypothesis is not entailed by the premise."
6586,Although we do the best we can--and we think our best is pretty good--it would be an amazing coincidence if the result of all these opposing temptations and self-conscious calculations was exactly the same quantity and slant of Microsoft coverage as if there was no connection.,"Our best is not always good, in others' eyes.",1,0,False,"step 1: the premise discusses the idea that the result of various opposing forces (temptations, self-conscious calculations) in determining microsoft coverage might be the same as if there was no connection. it acknowledges that this would be an 'amazing coincidence'. step 2: the hypothesis proposes that 'our best' is not always perceived as good by others. this is not a direct implication of the premise, but it is related in the sense that both discuss evaluations of 'our best'. step 3: while the hypothesis is related to the premise, it is not logically entailed. the premise is about the potential for coincidence in coverage results, whereas the hypothesis is about the perception of 'our best' by others. the hypothesis can be seen as a possible explanation for the premise's 'amazing coincidence', but it is not a necessary or guaranteed conclusion."
6587,A man in a suit and tie and a woman with luggage join others in waiting in the London Underground.,A couple are in the Underground.,1,1,True,"step 1: in the premise, we have a man and a woman present in the london underground. both the man and the woman are described in a way that is consistent with a couple. a man in a suit and tie and a woman with luggage are common stereotypes of businesspeople or travelers, and joining others in waiting is a behavior often associated with couples. no contradictory information is presented.step 2: the hypothesis 'a couple are in the underground' is a logical inference from the premise. the man and the woman described in the premise meet the criteria for being a couple, and the underground is a reasonable location for a couple to be found.step 3: based on the logical reasoning and the lack of contradictory information, the hypothesis 'a couple are in the underground' is entailed by the premise."
6588,"What were they like, the two men you passed? Tommy frowned in an effort at remembrance.",Tommy couldn't remember what the men that passed looked like.,1,1,True,"step 1: in the premise, tommy is described as making an effort to remember the appearance of the two men he passed. this implies that he currently cannot recall their exact features. step 2: the hypothesis states that tommy couldn't remember what the men looked like, which is identical in meaning to the premise. the hypothesis can be logically inferred from the premise since the hypothesis simply restates the information presented in the premise in a different way. step 3: based on the logical equivalence between the premise and hypothesis, the hypothesis is entailed by the premise."
6589,"A problem common to all programs was the untimely closure of cases, although again the extent of the problem in any particular program varied from under 4 percent in one program to over 30 percent in another.",All programs had a reasonable amount of time for their closure of cases.,0,0,True,"step 1: in the premise, it is mentioned that there was a common problem across all programs regarding the untimely closure of cases. the extent of this problem varied greatly, with some programs experiencing less than 4 percent of cases being closed late, while others had over 30 percent of cases closed late. this implies that not all programs had a 'reasonable amount of time' for closing cases, as stated in the hypothesis. however, the premise does not explicitly say that no program had a reasonable amount of time for closing cases. step 2: the hypothesis cannot be logically inferred from the premise as it contradicts the information provided in the premise. the hypothesis assumes that all programs had a reasonable amount of time for closing cases, which is not supported by the premise. step 3: based on the logical analysis, the hypothesis is not entailed by the premise."
6590,The comments submitted to the Commission and live testimony indicated widely disparate agricultural needs.,The comments indicated all the agricultural needs were the same.,0,0,True,"step 1: in the premise, 'widely disparate agricultural needs' implies that various individuals or groups had different requirements for agriculture. 'indicated' suggests that this information was explicitly stated in the comments. 'live testimony' further reinforces the idea of individual expressions. step 2: the hypothesis asserts that all agricultural needs were the same, which directly contradicts the information in the premise. there is no logical connection or implication of the hypothesis from the premise. step 3: based on the given information, the hypothesis cannot be logically inferred from the premise."
6591,yeah well i'm well i'm definitely for it,I am opposed to it on all levels.,0,0,True,"step 1: in the premise, the speaker expresses their support or agreement for something. this is a subjective statement and does not provide specific information about the topic or the context. step 2: the hypothesis expresses the opposite of the premise, stating that the speaker is opposed to it on all levels. however, the hypothesis makes a stronger claim than the premise, as it implies that the speaker holds this opposition consistently across all aspects related to the topic. step 3: the hypothesis cannot be logically inferred from the premise, as the premise does not provide enough information to deduce the speaker's opposition on all levels. the hypothesis contradicts the premise but goes beyond the information provided in the premise."
6592,Other things she showed me had more beauty than I have ever known.,She showed me around her country and I found new beauty in life.,1,1,True,"step 1: in the premise, 'other things she showed me' implies that the speaker has been introduced to new and beautiful things by someone else. 'more beauty than i have ever known' indicates a significant increase in the speaker's perception of beauty. step 2: the hypothesis suggests that the speaker's exposure to new things during a visit to someone's country led to a new appreciation for beauty. this can be inferred from the premise as it describes the speaker experiencing new beauty, which aligns with the hypothesis. step 3: based on the logical connection between the premise and hypothesis, and the absence of contradictory information, the hypothesis can be inferred from the premise."
6593,"A minute later Hanson, Bork and Nema were alone with the old man.",They did not get the chance to be alone with the old man.,0,0,True,"step 1: in the premise, it is stated that hanson, bork, and nema were alone with the old man at a certain point in time. this information does not necessarily mean they had been alone with him for the entire duration leading up to that moment. it is possible for them to have only become alone with him recently, or for him to have been alone with others before they arrived. step 2: the hypothesis states that they did not get the chance to be alone with the old man. this is a contradiction of the premise, as the premise states that they were indeed alone with him. step 3: based on the given information and logical principles, the hypothesis is not entailed by the premise as it contradicts it."
6594,okay well what are we doing about recycling in our community,Our community does not recycle.,1,0,False,"step 1: in the premise, there is a question about the actions being taken in the community regarding recycling. it does not provide any definitive information about recycling or its absence. step 2: the hypothesis states that recycling is not occurring in the community. this is a contradiction of the premise, as the premise asks about the actions being taken, implying that some action is indeed occurring. step 3: based on the logical analysis, the hypothesis that 'our community does not recycle' is not entailed by the premise 'okay well what are we doing about recycling in our community'. the premise does not provide enough information to logically infer the hypothesis."
6595,Vatican II gave rise to a less hierarchical and more outward-looking Catholicism and set the stage for once-unthinkable innovations like plainclothes nuns and the celebration of the Mass in English and other modern languages.,Vatican II's changes to Catholicism were borne out of necessity because the church was concerned about losing members.,1,1,True,"step 1: in the premise, vatican ii is described as leading to a less hierarchical and more outward-looking catholicism, enabling innovations like plainclothes nuns and the celebration of the mass in various languages. this indicates a shift towards greater inclusivity and engagement with the modern world. no contradictory facts are provided.step 2: the hypothesis suggests that the changes in catholicism were borne out of necessity due to the church's concern about losing members. this inference can be drawn from the premise as it implies that the church was responding to external pressures. this response is not a direct contradiction, but rather an extension of the reasoning presented in the premise.step 3: based on the logical reasoning and the lack of contradictory facts, the hypothesis can be inferred from the premise. the premise implies that vatican ii responded to external pressures, and the hypothesis proposes a specific reason for that response."
6596,I'm looking forward to that.,I must be sure I'm well prepared for when that happens.,1,0,False,"step 1: looking forward to something implies anticipation or excitement about an upcoming event. it does not inherently involve being unprepared or requiring preparation. however, the hypothesis suggests the need for preparation. step 2: the hypothesis does not logically follow from the premise as looking forward to something does not necessitate the need for preparation. common sense and logical principles do not support the inference of the hypothesis from the premise. step 3: based on the given information, logical principles, and common sense reasoning, the hypothesis is not entailed by the premise."
6597,"Lisbon and Porto offer all kinds of live music, theater, bars, and clubs, and resorts along the Algarve are well-stocked with bars and discos.",Lisbon requires silence at all times.,0,0,True,"step 1: analyzing the premise, we note that it describes lisbon and porto as cities that offer various forms of entertainment, including live music, theater, bars, and clubs. additionally, it mentions that resorts along the algarve are well-stocked with bars and discos, indicating a vibrant nightlife scene.step 2: contrarily, the hypothesis asserts that lisbon requires silence at all times. this is directly contrary to the information provided in the premise, which describes lisbon as a city that offers a lively and varied nightlife scene.step 3: based on the logical analysis of the given information and the direct contradiction between the hypothesis and the premise, the hypothesis cannot be logically inferred from the premise.step 4: the hypothesis is a false assumption, as it contradicts the facts stated in the premise."
6598,"Contrary to assertions by some, independence is more than a state of mind.",Independence is achievable.,0,1,False,"step 1: the premise asserts that independence is more than a mental state, suggesting it is a complex concept that likely involves more than just one's mindset. no contradictory information is provided in the premise.step 2: the hypothesis asserts that independence is achievable, meaning it is a goal or outcome that can be obtained. this does not contradict the premise as the idea of achievement can be seen as an extension or manifestation of being independent in a more than mental sense.step 3: based on the logical reasoning that the hypothesis does not contradict the premise and can be seen as a logical extension of the concept of independence being more than a mental state, the hypothesis is a valid inference from the premise.step 4: furthermore, common sense supports the idea that people can strive for and achieve independence in various aspects of their lives, such as financial, emotional, or personal independence.label: 1"

6601,Both initial and supplemental proposed rule publications invited comments on the information collection requirements imposed by the rule.,There's no point in following politics or voting because your vote won't actually make a difference.,1,0,False,"step 1: in the premise, it is stated that both initial and supplemental proposed rule publications invited comments on the information collection requirements imposed by the rule. this means that there was a process in place for public input and review of the rule. the hypothesis, on the other hand, is not related to the content of the rule or the public comment process.step 2: the hypothesis 'there's no point in following politics or voting because your vote won't actually make a difference' contradicts the premise, as it implies that individual actions, such as voting, are insignificant. however, the premise does not provide any evidence or implication that this is the case.step 3: based on the logical analysis, the hypothesis cannot be inferred from the premise, as they address different topics. the premise pertains to the public comment process for a rule, while the hypothesis deals with the significance of individual actions like voting."
6602,"There are, however, four other applications of case studies that are less often used at present but that could be appropriate for our jobs.",There are four applications that aren't useful for us at all.,0,0,True,"step 1: in the premise, it is stated that there are four other applications of case studies that are less often used but could be appropriate for certain jobs. this implies that these applications have some potential use, even if they are not as common. step 2: the hypothesis suggests that these applications are not useful for us at all. a complete lack of utility would mean that these applications provide no benefit whatsoever, but the premise does not indicate this. step 3: therefore, based on the information provided, the hypothesis cannot be logically inferred from the premise."

6607,Then he gave in.,He gave in to the pain.,1,1,True,"step 1: 'then he gave in' suggests that after some resistance or struggle, he eventually yielded or surrendered. this could be due to various reasons, including giving up, succumbing to pressure, or acknowledging defeat. 'giving in' is a general term that can encompass various meanings.step 2: 'he gave in to the pain' is a specific instance of 'giving in'. it implies that the reason for his yielding was experiencing or feeling the pain. this meaning is consistent with the general meaning of 'giving in' in the premise.step 3: given that 'he gave in' could mean giving in to various reasons, and 'he gave in to the pain' is a specific instance of 'giving in', it can be logically inferred from the premise. the hypothesis is a more detailed explanation of the reason for his yielding, which is consistent with the information given in the premise."
6608,"Said he was trailing two crooks.""",He said he was trailing three chickens.,0,0,True,"step 1: the premise describes an action or event where a person 'said he was trailing two crooks'. this implies that the person was following or pursuing two criminals. there are no logical connections or commonsense implications that suggest anything about chickens.step 2: the hypothesis asserts a different situation where 'he said he was trailing three chickens'. this is a clear contradiction to the premise as it changes the subject of the person's action from 'two crooks' to 'three chickens'.step 3: based on the given information, the hypothesis is not entailed by the premise as they describe distinct situations."
6609,"Former Republican National Committee Chairman Haley Barbour, too, is working on behalf of the companies involved in the settlement, and he deserves as much scorn as his Democratic counterparts.",Haley Barbour should be universally praised for this stand on this issue.,0,0,True,"step 1: in the premise, haley barbour is identified as working on behalf of the companies involved in a settlement and deserving of scorn. this implies that barbour is acting in the interest of these companies. step 2: the hypothesis suggests that barbour should be universally praised, which is directly contradictory to the premise's assertion that he deserves scorn. common sense suggests that a person cannot be both universally praised and deserving of scorn at the same time for the same action. step 3: based on the logical inconsistency between the premise and hypothesis, and the lack of any additional context or information that would change this conclusion, the hypothesis cannot be logically inferred from the premise."
6610,"The Time cover profiles the committee to save the world: Treasury Secretary Robert Rubin, Deputy Secretary Lawrence Summers, and Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan.",The committee to save the world consists of only two individuals. ,0,0,True,"step 1: analyzing the premise, it states that the time cover profiles three individuals: robert rubin, lawrence summers, and alan greenspan, who are part of a committee to save the world. no information is given about the size of the committee or the number of individuals it might typically include. common sense and factual knowledge do not suggest that a committee to save the world would consist of only two individuals. step 2: the hypothesis contradicts the information presented in the premise as it states that the committee consists of only two individuals, while the premise clearly states that there are three individuals in the committee. step 3: based on the information from the premise and the logical contradiction between the premise and hypothesis, the hypothesis cannot be logically inferred from the premise."

'them' refers to a group or category of entities, which is not explicitly stated but can be inferred from the context. the speaker uses the phrase 'once in a while' to emphasize the rarity of encountering these entities in the location described.step 2: the hypothesis states that 'it is a rare event to see one of them down here.' this statement is identical in meaning to the premise, as both express the rarity of encountering 'them' in the specified location.step 3: given that the hypothesis and premise convey the same meaning, the hypothesis can be logically inferred from the premise.step 4: the hypothesis is a logical consequence of the premise."
6614,"The museum focuses on Spanish and international 20th- century art, and is best known for exhibiting Picasso's monumental Guernica behind bulletproof glass.","The bulletproof glass makes it somewhat difficult to see the painting, but the museum considers it an acceptable cost for protecting it.",1,1,True,"step 1: in the premise, we learn that the museum exhibits spanish and international 20th-century art, with a particular focus on picasso's guernica. the presence of bulletproof glass around the painting indicates that it is a valuable and potentially vulnerable piece.step 2: the hypothesis suggests that viewing the painting through bulletproof glass might be less than ideal, but the museum finds the security measures necessary. the premise does not contradict or reject this notion, as it does not mention the ease or difficulty of viewing the painting.step 3: based on the given information and logical reasoning, the hypothesis can be inferred from the premise. it does not change the core meaning of the premise, but rather adds a detail about the museum's approach to preserving the valuable artwork."
6615,One wakes Tipper.,One puts Tipper to sleep.,0,0,True,"step 1: the premise 'one wakes tipper' implies an action where someone causes tipper to be awake or conscious. this is the opposite of putting something to sleep, which implies making it unconscious. step 2: the hypothesis 'one puts tipper to sleep' contradicts the premise 'one wakes tipper' since waking someone up is the opposite of putting them to sleep. step 3: based on the logical inconsistency between the premise and hypothesis, the hypothesis is not entailed by the premise."
6616,well i i assume that you live in do you live in Texas,I'm assuming you live in Texas; is that true?,1,1,True,"step 1: in the premise, the speaker is making an assumption about my location, stating that they assume i live in texas. this is an example of a conditional statement, where the speaker's assumption is based on some information they have. the hypothesis is a similar statement, where the speaker is also assuming that i live in texas.step 2: given the information in the premise, the hypothesis can be logically inferred. the hypothesis is a restatement of the assumption made in the premise, and it is consistent with the information provided.step 3: based on the logical equivalence between the premise and hypothesis, the hypothesis can be inferred from the premise."
6617,"In 1951, the Lake District National Park was created, which extended this protection to a much wider area while imposing planning regulations and environmental guidelines and allowing further public access to the land.",The Lake District National Park was created in the 18th century.,0,0,True,"step 1: in the premise, it is clearly stated that the lake district national park was created in 1951. this information is factual and unambiguous. step 2: the hypothesis, on the other hand, asserts that the lake district national park was created in the 18th century, which is contrary to the factual information in the premise. step 3: the hypothesis is not logically inferable from the premise as the actions described in the premise (extending protection, imposing regulations, and increasing public access) are not typical of what would have occurred during the 18th century. moreover, the existence of planning regulations and environmental guidelines, which are a response to modern concerns, is inconsistent with an 18th-century setting. therefore, the hypothesis cannot be inferred from the premise."
6618,well how did you get a recipe for pudding on your own,How did you get a recipe for pudding? I found mine online.,1,1,True,"step 1: both the premise and hypothesis are questioning the source of how a person obtained a recipe for pudding. the premise implies that the speaker obtained the recipe on their own, but it does not specify the method. the hypothesis states that the speaker found their recipe online.step 2: the hypothesis does not contradict the premise, as the premise allows for various ways of obtaining a recipe on one's own, including finding it online. in fact, the hypothesis provides an additional detail about one possible method of obtaining a recipe on one's own.step 3: based on the logical relationship between the premise and hypothesis, the hypothesis can be inferred from the premise as a specific example of how one can obtain a recipe on their own.step 4: the hypothesis is a valid inference from the premise, as it does not change the meaning or implications of the premise, but rather adds more information about it."
6619,"The new version of Microsoft's Web browser, Internet Explorer 4.0, due out next month, will allow (but--Microphobes please note--not require ) automatic download of Slate.",You can automatically download Slate together when Microsoft releases Internet Explorer 4.0 the second week of the following month.,1,1,True,"step 1: in the premise, microsoft's new internet explorer 4.0 version will allow the automatic download of slate. this means that users have the option to download slate automatically when they install or update internet explorer 4.0. step 2: the hypothesis suggests the same sequence of events but with more precise timing. it states that the automatic download of slate occurs during the specific week in the following month when internet explorer 4.0 is released. given that the premise indicates the availability of this feature, it is a logical inference that the automatic download can indeed take place during that week. step 3: based on the logical connection between the premise and hypothesis, and the lack of contradictory information, the hypothesis can be inferred from the premise."
6621,But he acts as if he knows it.,He is confident in the way he asks because he knows it.,1,1,True,"step 1: in the premise, the person 'acts as if he knows it'. this implies that the person behaves or speaks in a way that suggests they have knowledge or certainty about something. step 2: the hypothesis states that 'he is confident in the way he asks because he knows it'. confidence in speaking or asking a question is a reasonable inference from acting 'as if one knows it'. both actions indicate a level of certainty or knowledge. step 3: based on the logical connection between 'acting as if one knows it' and 'being confident because one knows it', the hypothesis can be logically inferred from the premise."
6622,"This has a multiplier  one lawyer trains 20 social workers, each of whom helps 50 clients, resulting in 1,000 people and families getting legal information, materials or referrals they might otherwise not have had.",The lawyer also gave them a place to live.,1,1,True,"step 1: the premise describes a scenario where one lawyer trains 20 social workers. each social worker assists 50 clients, leading to 1,000 people and families receiving legal information, materials, or referrals. this scenario implies that the lawyer and social workers are helping people meet their needs through various means, including legal assistance.step 2: the hypothesis suggests that in addition to providing legal information, materials, or referrals, the lawyer also gave 1,000 people and families a place to live. while the premise does not explicitly state this, it does not contradict the hypothesis. there is no logical reason why a lawyer or social worker could not also provide housing assistance to their clients.step 3: the hypothesis can be inferred from the premise based on the principle of charity, which assumes that all statements in a text are true unless proven otherwise. in this case, there is no reason to believe that the hypothesis contradicts the premise or lacks factual basis. therefore, the hypothesis is a reasonable extension of the information provided in the premise.step 4: furthermore, it is common sense that lawyers and social workers may provide various forms of assistance to their clients, including housing, to ensure their overall well-being. providing housing assistance does not contradict the premise, as the premise only specifies that the lawyer and social workers helped 1,000 people and families in some capacity.step 5: in conclusion, the hypothesis that 'the lawyer also gave them a place to live' is a reasonable inference from the premise, as it does not contradict the information provided and can be explained by common sense and logical reasoning."

6630,"The combination of methodologies in the study of the same phenomenon or construct; a method of establishing the accuracy of information by comparing three or more types of independent points of view on data sources (for example, interviews, observation, and documentation; different investigations; different times) bearing on the same findings.",It does no good to compare more than three types of independent viewpoints on data sources.,0,0,True,"step 1: in the premise, a methodology is described that involves comparing multiple types of independent points of view on data sources to establish accuracy. this methodology implies that the more perspectives are compared, the more accurate and reliable the findings become. step 2: the hypothesis, however, asserts that comparing more than three types of independent viewpoints is unnecessary or fruitless. this directly contradicts the premise, which states that the more viewpoints are compared, the more reliable the findings. step 3: based on the logical inconsistency between the premise and hypothesis, it is clear that the hypothesis cannot be inferred from the premise. in fact, the hypothesis goes against the very foundation of the methodology described in the premise.step 4: it's important to note that the hypothesis might still be valid in certain contexts, but it is not a logical consequence of the premise. in other words, the premise does not entail the hypothesis."
6631,"There are usually separate entrances for men (erkek) and women (kadyn), but if there is only one chamber, then different times are set aside for men and women.",The men and women walk in at the same time and entrance.,0,0,True,"step 1: in the premise, it is stated that there are usually separate entrances for men and women, but if there is only one chamber, then different times are set aside for men and women. this implies that under normal circumstances, gender segregation is practiced, but when there is a single chamber and limited time slots, this regulation is adjusted.step 2: the hypothesis contradicts the premise because it suggests that men and women enter at the same time using the same entrance, which is not the usual practice according to the premise.step 3: based on the given information, the hypothesis cannot be logically inferred from the premise as it contradicts it."
6633,"Some investments in stewardship land, for example national parks, will be reported by both 1) the number of acres used as a park or an historic site in the stewardship land category, and 2) by the number of physical units identified as national parks in the heritage assets category.",Some investments in stewardship land are reported only by number of acres used.,0,0,True,"step 1: the premise states that some investments in stewardship land are reported in two different ways - by the number of acres used and by the number of physical units identified. this implies that these investments can be reported using both metrics.step 2: the hypothesis suggests that some investments in stewardship land are reported only by the number of acres used. this is not a direct contradiction of the premise, as the premise allows for investments to be reported in only one of the ways mentioned. however, the hypothesis is less specific than the premise, as it does not mention the possibility of investments being reported by the number of physical units.step 3: based on the given information, the hypothesis cannot be logically inferred from the premise. while the premise allows for the possibility of investments being reported only by the number of acres used, it does not necessarily entail that this is the case for all such investments. the hypothesis is a valid statement, but it does not follow logically from the premise as stated."
6634,A new clue. ,A new clue to the kidnapping case.,1,0,False,"step 1: 'a new clue' refers to some piece of information that was previously unknown and now becomes relevant. the context of the premise does not specify the nature of the clue. 'a new clue to the kidnapping case' is a more specific version of the same information, implying that the new clue is related to a particular kidnapping case.step 2: the hypothesis is not logically inferred from the premise as the premise does not contain the word 'kidnapping' or any indication of a crime or investigation. the hypothesis adds an extra piece of information that is not explicitly stated in the premise.step 3: based on the given information, the hypothesis cannot be logically inferred from the premise."
6635,yeah right right it won't and that's something i like too because,It will and I hate that.,0,0,True,"step 1: both the premise and hypothesis express personal opinions about a preference or likelihood. neither sentence can be logically derived from the other based on the given information. they contradict each other, with the premise stating 'it won't' and the hypothesis stating 'it will'.step 2: the hypothesis cannot be inferred from the premise as they express contradictory opinions.step 3: based on the logical reasoning, there is no entailment between the premise and hypothesis."

6660,"The Fashion Outlet Mall at Primm, Nevada (on the California state line) is the latest entry into the outlet mall roser, and the best.",The Fashion Outlet Mall at Primm is both the largest and cheapest in the USA.,1,0,False,"step 1. in the premise, it is stated that the fashion outlet mall at primm is the latest and the best entry into the outlet mall scene. no specific information is provided about its size or price. step 2. the hypothesis asserts that the fashion outlet mall at primm is not only the best but also the largest and cheapest in the usa. however, the premise does not logically entail this information. step 3. since the premise only states that the fashion outlet mall at primm is the latest and best, without providing any information about its size or price, it cannot be logically inferred that it is the largest and cheapest in the usa.step 4. it is important to note that while the hypothesis may not be logically entailed by the premise, it does not necessarily contradict it either. the premise and hypothesis describe different aspects of the fashion outlet mall at primm. the hypothesis can be considered an extension of the premise, adding more details about the mall's size and price.step 5. in the absence of contradictory information and given the lack of logical entailment, it is not appropriate to assign a definitive label to this question. however, based on the given information, the hypothesis cannot be considered to be logically entailed by the premise."
6661,The Episcopalians are all going to hell.,All Episcopalians will go to heaven.,0,0,True,"step 1: in the premise, a statement is made about the religious destiny of all episcopalians. the premise expresses a negative judgment, asserting that they are all going to hell. however, this statement is based on an incorrect or biased assumption, as it is not a valid or logically sound conclusion about the religious beliefs or moral worth of all episcopalians. there is no factual basis or logical connection between being an episcopalian and deserving eternal damnation. step 2: the hypothesis proposes an opposite statement, claiming that all episcopalians will go to heaven. this contradicts the premise, and there is no logical relationship or justification for this statement based on the information given in the premise. step 3: given that the premise is based on an incorrect or biased assumption, and the hypothesis contradicts the premise without any logical justification or factual basis, the hypothesis is not entailed by the premise."
6662,"Guba, Egon G. Criteria for Assessing the Trustworthiness of Naturalistic Inquiries.",There is no such thing as Criteria for Assessing the Trustworthiness of Naturalistic Inquiries.,0,0,True,"step 1: in this example, the premise is a statement by egon g. guba about the existence of 'criteria for assessing the trustworthiness of naturalistic inquiries'. the hypothesis denies the existence of such criteria. step 2: the hypothesis contradicts the premise as it asserts that something does not exist, while the premise asserts that it does. step 3: a contradiction between two statements cannot logically follow from one another, as they represent incompatible propositions. therefore, the hypothesis cannot be logically inferred from the premise. step 4: it's important to note that the validity or truth of a premise does not automatically mean that its negation is false. the hypothesis does not entail that guba's criteria are inherently untrustworthy or flawed; it simply denies their existence.step 5: additionally, it's crucial to recognize that the truth or falsehood of the hypothesis doesn't depend on whether the premise is true or false. in other words, the truth of the premise does not prove the hypothesis to be false, and the falsehood of the premise does not prove the hypothesis to be true. this is a fundamental principle of logic known as the law of excluded middle.step 6: in conclusion, the hypothesis 'there is no such thing as criteria for assessing the trustworthiness of naturalistic inquiries' cannot be logically inferred from the premise 'guba, egon g. criteria for assessing the trustworthiness of naturalistic inquiries'."
6663,um-hum um-hum yeah buy a fresh filet of fish a nice one at the fish market uh the fish counter,Make sure you have enough fish filets to feed everyone.,1,1,True,"step 1: in the premise, the speaker is buying a fresh filet of fish from the fish market or fish counter. this action implies that the speaker intends to use the fish for consumption.step 2: the hypothesis suggests ensuring that there is an adequate number of fish filets to feed everyone. this implication aligns with the speaker's intention to buy fish for consumption in the premise. both sentences can be seen as related to the act of preparing food and feeding people.step 3: based on the logical connection between the premise and hypothesis, it can be inferred that the hypothesis is a reasonable implication of the premise. the speaker in the premise is buying fish for consumption, and ensuring there is enough fish to feed everyone is a logical consequence of that action.step 4: the hypothesis can be seen as a recommendation or precautionary measure to prevent running out of fish for everyone. it does not contradict the premise, but instead adds additional context and precaution.therefore, the hypothesis can be inferred from the premise, as they both relate to the act of buying fish for consumption and feeding people."
6664,Guggenheim and her dogs are buried here.,Guggenheim was partial to Corgis and kept many during her life.,1,0,False,"step 1: in the premise, 'guggenheim and her dogs are buried here', the subject guggenheim is associated with dogs. no specific breed is mentioned. however, the premise does not provide any information about guggenheim's preferences or the number of dogs she owned. step 2: the hypothesis suggests that guggenheim had a preference for corgis and kept many of them. while the premise does not contradict this, it doesn't provide any evidence for it either. step 3: to evaluate if the hypothesis can be logically inferred from the premise, we would need additional information linking guggenheim to corgis. the absence of such information means that the hypothesis cannot be logically inferred from the premise. step 4: it's important to note that a lack of entailment does not mean that the hypothesis is false; it simply means that it cannot be logically deduced from the given premise alone."
6665,so we always have the gang on tape and we see how they grow each year yeah yeah that's a lot of fun,We film the kids eating.,0,0,True,"step 1: in the premise, it is mentioned that 'so we always have the gang on tape' and they are observed 'growing each year'. this suggests that videos or recordings of the kids exist and are regularly watched. there is no explicit mention of what the kids are doing in these videos. the premise is factually accurate and there are no logical inconsistencies.step 2: the hypothesis 'we film the kids eating' is not explicitly stated or logical entailed in the premise. however, it is a possible inference that could be drawn from the given information. it is common for home videos or documentaries to include scenes of people eating. the lack of a clear contradiction between the premise and hypothesis, and the possibility of the hypothesis being a reasonable inference based on common experiences, makes it worth considering.step 3: while the hypothesis is not logically entailed by the premise, it is a reasonable inference that could be drawn based on the given information and common-sense understanding. the absence of any explicit statement or evidence to the contrary in the premise does not negate the possibility of filming the kids eating.step 4: however, it is important to note that the hypothesis is not a necessary or inevitable conclusion from the premise. the premise does not provide enough information to definitively determine if filming the kids eating is a part of their annual recordings or not.therefore, based on the available information, the hypothesis 'we film the kids eating' can neither be definitively proven nor disproven to be entailed by the premise."
6666,These show performances from December or January until late spring or early summer.,The shows can be watched for free.,1,0,False,"step 1: the premise describes a time frame for the performances, from december or january to late spring or early summer. it does not provide any information about the cost of admission. step 2: the hypothesis makes a statement about the cost of the shows, suggesting they can be watched for free. this information is not explicitly mentioned in the premise. step 3: to determine if the hypothesis can be logically inferred from the premise, we need to consider if there's any reason to believe that the ability to watch the shows for free is related to the given time frame. common sense and logical reasoning don't provide any such connection. therefore, the hypothesis is not entailed by the premise."
6667,In an ugly tux.,It is a beautiful tux.,0,0,True,"step 1: in the premise, the adjective 'ugly' is used to describe the tux. the meaning of 'ugly' is generally understood as not pleasing to the eye or not attractive. step 2: the hypothesis, on the other hand, uses the adjective 'beautiful' which is the opposite of 'ugly'. therefore, the hypothesis directly contradicts the information given in the premise. step 3: based on the provided information, the hypothesis 'it is a beautiful tux' cannot be logically inferred from the premise 'in an ugly tux'."
6668,"The majority of those responding felt that homosexuality was not a mental disorder, and the APA accordingly removed it from the DSM 's next published edition.",Homosexuality does not exist in humans.,0,0,True,"step 1: in the premise, it is stated that the majority of responders felt that homosexuality was not a mental disorder, and the american psychological association (apa) removed it from the diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders (dsm) as a result. this premise indicates that the prevailing view is that homosexuality is not a mental disorder. step 2: the hypothesis, 'homosexuality does not exist in humans', suggests the complete absence or non-existence of homosexuality. this is a more extreme claim than the premise. step 3: the premise does not logically entail the hypothesis because it does not make any claims about the existence or non-existence of homosexuality. the premise only indicates the consensus that homosexuality is not a mental disorder. therefore, the hypothesis is not logically inferred from the premise. step 4: it's important to note that the hypothesis contradicts facts and common knowledge. there is ample evidence suggesting that homosexuality does exist in humans, and it is a normal variation of human sexuality. thus, the hypothesis is not only not logically inferred from the premise, but it is also factually incorrect."
6669,"If you're not one to be put off by superstition, stroll down to the old cobbled bridge and croseover into a quieter, more peaceful world.",The world beyond the cobbled bridge is noisy.,0,0,True,"step 1: in the premise, the description of the world beyond the cobbled bridge as 'quieter' and 'more peaceful' indicates a contrast to a noisy or chaotic environment. this is a figure of speech used to create an image of tranquility. step 2: the hypothesis that 'the world beyond the cobbled bridge is noisy' contradicts the information provided in the premise. no logical connection or inference can be made from the premise to the hypothesis based on the given information. step 3: based on the logical analysis, the hypothesis cannot be inferred from the premise."
6670,"It must have been got quite lately, I think. ",It must be brand new.,1,1,True,"step 1: both the premise and hypothesis express opinions about the newness of an object, using the modal verb 'must have been' and 'must be' respectively. they share a similar meaning as they both indicate that the object is relatively new.step 2: the hypothesis 'it must be brand new' can be inferred from the premise 'it must have been got quite lately' because 'quite lately' implies a short time frame, and 'brand new' implies an even shorter time frame. the hypothesis is a stronger statement than the premise, as it explicitly states that the object is new and not just recently acquired.step 3: based on the logical reasoning that the stronger statement can be inferred from the weaker one, and the semantic similarity between the two statements, the hypothesis can be inferred from the premise."
6671,"For example, the government, in its role as purchaser, can offer rewards and apply sanctions to a chief executive officer to ensure performance.",The government is the chief purchaser for all sectors of business and thus wields great buying power.,1,1,True,"step 1: in the premise, the government is described as having the role of a purchaser in certain business contexts and having the ability to offer rewards and apply sanctions to a ceo to ensure performance. this indicates that the government has some influence over business through its purchasing power.step 2: the hypothesis proposes that the government is the chief purchaser for all sectors of business, implying they have substantial buying power across all industries. this is a logical extension from the premise, as the premise establishes the government's purchasing power in some contexts, and the hypothesis generalizes this power to all sectors.step 3: based on the information provided, the hypothesis is a logical entailment of the premise. the premise lays the foundation for the hypothesis, and the hypothesis is a natural conclusion based on the premise's content."
6672,"DEAR TOMMY, I knew it was you last night.","Tommy, I knew you were around last night, even though I could not see you.",1,1,True,"step 1: in the premise, the speaker (implicitly 'i') is making a statement that they identified tommy as the person involved in an event last night. 'knew it was you' implies recognition of tommy's presence or actions. step 2: the hypothesis is a similar statement but presented from the perspective of the speaker acknowledging tommy's presence around them last night, without necessarily seeing him. given that the speaker in the premise had knowledge of tommy being involved, it is a reasonable inference that they could have known of his presence even if they did not see him. step 3: based on the logical connection between the premise and hypothesis, and the fact that they both involve tommy and the speaker's knowledge of his presence, the hypothesis can be logically inferred from the premise."
6673,"Oh, you're right.",You couldn't be more wrong.,0,0,True,"step 1: in this example, the premise and hypothesis are statements of opposing views about the truth of a situation. the premise is an acknowledgement of an assertion made by someone else, while the hypothesis denies that assertion. there is no new information provided in the hypothesis that is not already implied in the premise.step 2: the hypothesis cannot be logically inferred from the premise because they are contradictory statements. if the hypothesis is true, then the premise is false, and if the premise is true, then the hypothesis is false.step 3: based on the logical principles of non-contradiction and the given information, the hypothesis is not entailed by the premise."
6674,yeah it's got to come back,"Yeah, rock music got to come back ",1,1,True,"step 1: in the premise, 'it' is referred to as something that 'got to come back.' the meaning of 'it' is not clear without additional context. however, the verb 'got to come back' implies a return or revival of something.step 2: in the hypothesis, 'rock music' is identified as the subject that 'got to come back.' there is no logical contradiction between the premise and hypothesis. the hypothesis suggests that 'it' (something) being 'rock music' is a reasonable assumption, given no information to the contrary.step 3: based on the available information, the hypothesis can be inferred from the premise. while the premise does not explicitly state 'rock music,' the use of 'it' and 'got to come back' can be reasonably interpreted to include various possibilities, including 'rock music.'therefore, the hypothesis is a valid inference from the premise, even if the premise was not intended to specifically refer to rock music.label: 1"
6675,"Bardo Pond 's music is often classified as space rock, acid rock, post - rock, shoegazing, psychedelic rock.","Bardo Pond's music is often classified as space rock, acid rock, post-rock, shoegazing, noise or psychedelic rock.",1,1,True,"step 1: the premise provides a list of genres that bardo pond's music is often classified under. these genres include space rock, acid rock, post-rock, shoegazing, and psychedelic rock. no specific information is given that contradicts or narrows this list. step 2: the hypothesis also lists the same genres as the premise, with the addition of 'noise'. this new genre is not contradictory or impossible to infer from the given information. in fact, noise is sometimes associated with the genres mentioned in the premise, particularly with regard to their experimental and distorted sound qualities. step 3: based on the logical reasoning, the lack of contradictory information, and the common association of noise with the listed genres, the hypothesis can be inferred from the premise."
6676,"A woman, in a green shirt, preparing to run on a treadmill.",A woman is preparing to sleep on a treadmill.,0,0,True,"step 1: the premise describes a woman engaged in the action of preparing to use a treadmill for physical exercise. this involves wearing appropriate clothing, such as a green shirt, and setting up the equipment. common sense and factual knowledge indicate that a treadmill is an exercise machine designed for walking or running, not for sleeping. furthermore, there is no information in the premise suggesting that the woman intends to sleep on the treadmill. step 2: the hypothesis "
6677,"The river Canche flows right through the center of this small town, disappearing under buildings and hump-backed bridges.",The town has a big bridge that goes over the river.,1,1,True,"step 1: in the premise, it is mentioned that the river canche flows through the center of the small town, and it disappears under buildings and hump-backed bridges. this implies that there are structures, such as bridges, over the river. step 2: the hypothesis 'the town has a big bridge that goes over the river' is a specific type of bridge, but it does not contradict the premise as it is a logical implication - an inference that can be drawn from the given information. a big bridge is a type of bridge, and it is common for towns with rivers running through them to have bridges to allow access across the river. step 3: based on the logical reasoning, the hypothesis can be inferred from the premise as it is a specific instance of the more general information provided in the premise."
6678,Hong Kong Diary published weekly by HKTA tells what's happening in the arts.,Hong Kong diary publishes news about current events daily,0,0,True,"step 1: the premise states that hong kong diary is published weekly by hkta and it covers what's happening in the arts. this implies that the diary provides information about arts-related events and news on a regular basis. step 2: the hypothesis suggests that the hong kong diary publishes news about current events daily. while the premise does not explicitly state that the diary covers current events daily, it does not contradict this hypothesis. in fact, many weekly publications do cover current events daily on their websites or online editions. step 3: based on the information provided, the hypothesis cannot be definitively proven or disproven from the premise alone. the premise only states that the hong kong diary covers arts weekly, and it does not provide sufficient evidence to infer that it also covers current events daily. however, it is not illogical or contradictory for the hypothesis to be true, given the common practice of weekly publications providing daily online content.step 4: it is also important to consider that the hypothesis may be true, but not logically entailed by the premise. the premise and hypothesis describe different levels of frequency: weekly versus daily. the premise does not logically imply a daily publication, but rather a weekly one.therefore, the hypothesis is not logically entailed by the premise, but it may still be factually true."
6679,The reconstructed Kumamoto Castle is worth a visit for the significant role it played during the last hectic days of Japan's feudal era.,Kumamoto Castle was barely involved with the end of Japan's feudal era.,0,0,True,"step 1: in the premise, the importance of kumamoto castle is emphasized due to its role during the last days of japan's feudal era. the role it played is significant and worth noting. step 2: the hypothesis suggests a minimal involvement of kumamoto castle during the end of japan's feudal era. this directly contradicts the information given in the premise. step 3: based on the given information, the hypothesis is not a logically valid inference from the premise. the premise states that kumamoto castle played a significant role during the last days of japan's feudal era, and the hypothesis states the opposite, that it barely involved. therefore, the hypothesis is not entailed by the premise."
6680,I think we're going to find some other things.,I don't think we'll see other things.,0,0,True,"step 1: in the premise, the speaker expresses their belief that they will find other things. this indicates a positive expectation. in the hypothesis, the speaker expresses the opposite belief, that they won't find other things. step 2: the hypothesis contradicts the premise by negating the same statement. negation of a statement does not logically follow from the statement itself. step 3: based on the logical negation relationship between the premise and hypothesis and lack of additional context, the hypothesis cannot be inferred from the premise."
6681,"A small archaeological museum displays finds from the island, including the eastern site of Polyohni, which was a thriving city before its destruction by earthquake in 2100 b.c.",Polyohni left behind no archaeological finds.,0,0,True,"step 1: in the premise, it is stated that the small archaeological museum displays finds from the island, including the eastern site of polyohni. this indicates that there were archaeological finds from polyohni. step 2: the hypothesis contradicts the premise by stating that polyohni left behind no archaeological finds. thus, the hypothesis cannot be logically inferred from the premise. step 3: the hypothesis is not entailed by the premise based on the logical contradiction between the two statements."
6682,Ponta do Sol is the next village after Ribeira Brava.,Ponta do Sol is bigger than Ribeira Brava.,1,0,False,"step 1: the premise establishes a sequence of villages - ribeira brava and ponta do sol. there is no explicit information provided about their sizes.step 2: the hypothesis makes a claim about the size comparison between the two villages. however, the premise does not logically entail the hypothesis, as there is no mention of the size of either village in the premise.step 3: the hypothesis cannot be logically inferred from the premise since the premise does not provide enough information to make that conclusion."
6683,"Unfortunately, the majority of physicians (54%) screen only those patients they suspect based on their clinical impressions.",Most physicians use their impressions to determine which patients get screened.,1,1,True,"step 1: in the premise, it is stated that the majority of physicians (54%) screen only those patients they suspect based on their clinical impressions. this indicates that the physicians are using their clinical judgement or impressions to decide which patients need to be screened. step 2: the hypothesis, 'most physicians use their impressions to determine which patients get screened', is a restatement of the information in the premise. therefore, the hypothesis can be logically inferred from the premise. step 3: the hypothesis is a direct consequence of the information provided in the premise. no additional logical reasoning or common-sense assumptions are required."
6684,"After being diagnosed with cancer, Carrey's Kaufman decides to do a show at Carnegie Hall.",Carrey's Kaufman is only diagnosed with cancer after doing a show at Carnegie Hall.,0,0,True,"step 1: the premise states that carrey's kaufman is diagnosed with cancer before doing a show at carnegie hall. this is clear from the sequence of events described in the sentence. step 2: the hypothesis suggests a contradictory sequence of events, with carrey's kaufman being diagnosed with cancer after doing a show at carnegie hall. this is not logically inferred from the premise. in fact, the premise establishes the opposite. step 3: based on the logical analysis, the hypothesis is not entailed by the premise."
6685,"How else does one produce and control a salamander, except by magic?",Is it true that no one has ever created a salamander by magic?,0,0,True,"step 1: the premise is stating that producing and controlling a salamander can only be done through magic. it does not provide any information about whether anyone has actually done so. step 2: the hypothesis is stating that no one has ever created a salamander by magic. this statement is logically related to the premise as a negative implication. if producing and controlling a salamander can only be done through magic (premise), and no one has ever done it (hypothesis), then it follows that no one has ever created a salamander. step 3: based on the logical connection between the premise and hypothesis, and the absence of contradictory evidence, the hypothesis can be inferred from the premise.step 4: however, it is important to note that the premise is based on an assumption, as there is no scientific evidence or factual basis to support the claim that producing and controlling a salamander can only be done through magic. therefore, while the hypothesis can be logically inferred from the premise, it does not necessarily reflect the truth.thus, the hypothesis is a logical consequence of the premise, but it is not necessarily true."
6686,Both temples are within easy reach of the town of Aurangabad.,There are trains that make it easy to get to both temples.,1,0,False,"step 1: in the premise, it is stated that both temples are within easy reach of the town of aurangabad. this implies that the temples are relatively close to the town and can be accessed conveniently. step 2: the hypothesis suggests that there are trains that make it easy to get to both temples. trains are a common means of transportation, especially for longer distances, and their presence would make getting to the temples easier. step 3: since the temples are within easy reach of the town, it is reasonable to assume that there could be various means of transportation available to facilitate easy access to them. trains are a common and effective transportation method for larger distances. therefore, the hypothesis can be logically inferred from the premise.step 4: it is important to note that the premise does not necessarily mean that trains are the only or the only convenient means of transportation to the temples. it could also mean that the temples are accessible by other means such as buses or taxis, for instance. however, the hypothesis specifically mentions trains, and its logical inference does not contradict the premise. thus, the hypothesis is not necessarily a strict logical entailment of the premise, but it is a plausible and reasonable inference based on the given information."
6687,"Auditors should determine what steps the agency has taken to get feedback on its requirements, how the agency has handled comments or questions on a proposed RFP, and whether the agency has acted to ensure that contractor proposals are competitive.",Auditors will meet in June to discuss how the agency should handle questions on a proposed RFP.,1,0,False,"step 1: in the premise, the actions that auditors should take are clearly defined: they should determine steps taken by the agency to get feedback on its requirements, handle comments or questions on a proposed rfp, and ensure that contractor proposals are competitive. these actions do not directly imply a meeting in june or any specific time frame for discussions. step 2: the hypothesis states that auditors will meet in june to discuss how the agency should handle questions on a proposed rfp, but it does not specify whether they will make decisions or just discuss the issue. step 3: the hypothesis is not logically entailed by the premise, as the premise does not state or imply a meeting will occur. furthermore, the hypothesis introduces a new fact (the meeting in june) that is not mentioned in the premise. therefore, the hypothesis is not entailed by the premise."
6688,"The long, cobbled entrance avenue is shaded by plane trees, while the fields which lie on each side are carpeted with a wonderful spread of agapanthus and arum, and belladonna lilies in season.",There is arum and agapanthus located in the fields but no belladonna lilies.,0,0,True,"step 1: in the premise, it is mentioned that the fields are carpeted with a wonderful spread of agapanthus and arum. this means that both agapanthus and arum are present in the fields. step 2: the hypothesis states that there is arum and agapanthus in the fields but no belladonna lilies. the presence of arum and agapanthus as stated in the hypothesis is consistent with the information in the premise. step 3: the hypothesis does not contradict the premise and can be seen as a more specific version of the information given in the premise. it is not logically necessary that belladonna lilies be present in the fields just because agapanthus and arum are mentioned, so the hypothesis is not directly entailed by the premise. however, the premise does not rule out the hypothesis, and the hypothesis is consistent with the information in the premise. step 4: based on this logical reasoning and the consistency between the premise and hypothesis, the hypothesis is not logically entailed by the premise, but it is not contradictory to it either."
6689,ECONOMETRIC MODEL -An equation or a set of related equations used to analyze economic data through mathematical and statistical techniques.,Economic models are not related to data,0,0,True,"step 1: an econometric model is defined as a mathematical representation or an equation used to analyze economic data. this analysis is typically carried out through statistical techniques. the term 'economic data' refers to facts and figures about economic activity.step 2: the hypothesis suggests that economic models are unrelated or disconnected from economic data. however, the very purpose of an econometric model is to make inferences and derive insights from economic data using mathematical and statistical techniques. without any relationship to data, economic models would be meaningless and ineffective.step 3: given the definitions and the understanding of the roles and relationships between economic models and data, it is clear that the hypothesis contradicts the premise. economic models are essential tools for analyzing economic data, and the premise correctly identifies their connection.step 4: based on the logical reasoning and the factual inconsistency between the hypothesis and the premise, the hypothesis is not entailed by the premise."
6690,"Farther east, Elia and Agia Anna offer the promise of a little more space.",People are spread out more at Elia and Agia Anna.,1,1,True,"step 1: in the premise, elia and agia anna are described as being farther east and offering more space. the term 'more space' implies that there is likely more room between individuals or structures in these locations. step 2: the hypothesis suggests that people are spread out more at elia and agia anna. this hypothesis aligns with the information in the premise, as 'more space' suggests a larger area for people to inhabit, leading to a greater separation or dispersal of individuals. step 3: based on the logical connection between 'more space' and 'people being spread out more', the hypothesis is a reasonable inference from the premise."
6692,"Medicaid, established in 1965 by Title XIX of the Social Security Act, is a federal-state matching entitlement program that pays for medical assistance for certain vulnerable and needy individuals and families with low incomes and resources.",Medicaid was established to help fund the education of the upper middle class.,0,0,True,"step 1: analyzing the premise, medicaid is described as a federal-state matching entitlement program established in 1965 under title xix of the social security act, designed to pay for medical assistance for individuals and families with low incomes and resources. this program is based on economic need.step 2: the hypothesis suggests that medicaid was established to help fund education for the upper middle class. however, there is no information or logic linking medicaid to education for the upper middle class in the premise. the premise clearly states that medicaid is a healthcare program for individuals and families with low incomes and resources.step 3: based on the information provided, the hypothesis cannot be logically inferred from the premise. the hypothesis is a contradiction to the established facts about medicaid as described in the premise."
6693,what kind of a grass we have  oh Saint Augustine yeah it's Bermuda in the back it's the kind that has those you know grows sideways yeah that stuff,The grass is yellow in patches but otherwise green.,1,0,False,"step 1: in the premise, the type of grass is identified as st. augustine and bermuda, and it is described as having some parts that grow sideways. this information does not provide any direct indication about the color of the grass. common sense and factual knowledge about st. augustine bermuda grass do not indicate that it is typically yellow in patches. step 2: the hypothesis presents the information that the grass is yellow in patches but otherwise green. while there is no contradiction between the premise and hypothesis, the hypothesis does not logically follow from the premise as the premise does not provide any information about the color of the grass. step 3: based on the logical reasoning, the hypothesis cannot be inferred from the premise as the premise does not contain the necessary information to logically deduce the hypothesis."
6694,"They see politics as exclusively combative contests, involving haggling, maneuvering, bargaining and manipulating.",People generally raise their voices during debates.,1,1,True,"step 1: in the premise, politics is described as a competitive arena with behaviors such as haggling, maneuvering, bargaining, and manipulating. raising one's voice is a common behavior during heated debates or negotiations. this behavior can be seen as an expression of emotion, intensity, or passion in such situations. step 2: the hypothesis, 'people generally raise their voices during debates,' can be inferred from the premise since debates and negotiations are an integral part of the combative contests described in the premise. step 3: based on the logical connection between debates and negotiations being a part of the political scenario described in the premise and the common occurrence of raising voices during such situations, the hypothesis can be inferred from the premise."
6695,"He then says: 'Please take a seat, Mr. er?'  ",He asked the person to stand.,0,0,True,"step 1: the premise describes a situation where a person is asked to take a seat. 'take a seat' is an instruction for someone to sit down. it is factually inconsistent with 'he asked the person to stand' as they directly oppose each other. step 2: the hypothesis 'he asked the person to stand' cannot be logically inferred from the premise 'he then says: 'please take a seat, mr. er?'' as the hypothesized action directly contradicts the action described in the premise. step 3: based on the logical inconsistency between the premise and hypothesis, the hypothesis is not entailed by the premise."
6696,"I, Hercule Poirot, affirm that the man who entered the chemist's shop, and purchased strychnine at six o'clock on Monday last was not Mr. Inglethorp, for at six o'clock on that day Mr. Inglethorp was escorting Mrs. Raikes back to her home from a neighbouring farm. ","After escorting Mrs. Raikes back to her home, Mr. Inglethorp settled down to watch the game.",1,0,False,"step 1: in the premise, hercule poirot asserts that mr. inglethorp did not purchase strychnine at the chemist's shop at six o'clock on monday. the hypothesis describes an event that occurs after the time mentioned in the premise. step 2: the hypothesis neither logically entails nor contradicts the premise, as it describes an independent event involving mr. inglethorp. the premise only informs that mr. inglethorp was not at the chemist's shop purchasing strychnine at that specific time. step 3: there is no logical connection between the premise and the hypothesis, and the hypothesis does not follow from the premise."
6697,"Feral cats in poor neighborhoods like mine spread diseases, and their large number can make you feel you're living in a litter box.",Rich neighborhoods are crawling with disease ridden feral cats.,0,0,True,"step 1: in the premise, it is stated that feral cats in poor neighborhoods spread diseases and can make one feel like they're living in a litter box. this implies that there are a large number of feral cats in poor neighborhoods. no specific information is given about their presence or absence in rich neighborhoods. step 2: the hypothesis suggests that rich neighborhoods are 'crawling' with disease-ridden feral cats. this is a contradictory statement to the general assumption that rich neighborhoods have fewer issues with feral cats due to their resources and infrastructure. step 3: based on the lack of information in the premise regarding the presence or absence of feral cats in rich neighborhoods, and the contradictory nature of the hypothesis, it cannot be logically inferred from the premise.step 4: it is essential to note that the hypothesis is not just unlikely but also a common stereotype without factual basis. many studies have shown no evidence of a correlation between disease prevalence and socioeconomic status in feral cat populations. the hypothesis is an unwarranted assumption and not logically entailed by the premise.step 5: in conclusion, the hypothesis that 'rich neighborhoods are crawling with disease ridden feral cats' is not logically inferred from the premise and is an unwarranted assumption with no factual basis."
6698,so i'd end up sitting in the car for an hour and a half and then i you know a lot of it in car fumes you know inhaling car fumes,"I would cough badly after the car ride, due to the fumes.",1,1,True,"step 1: in the premise, the speaker describes the situation where they will be sitting in a car for an hour and a half, and expresses concern about inhaling car fumes. the mention of 'car fumes' implies the presence of harmful substances that can cause discomfort or adverse health effects. common sense suggests that inhaling such substances can lead to coughing. step 2: the hypothesis, 'i would cough badly after the car ride, due to the fumes,' is a logical consequence of the premise. the premise sets up the context of being exposed to harmful car fumes for an extended period, and the hypothesis describes the expected health outcome of this exposure. step 3: based on the logical connection between the premise and hypothesis, common sense reasoning, and no contradictory information, the hypothesis can be inferred from the premise."
6699,It's worth sidetracking into the hills just to marvel at how much money some people actually have.,The hills are basically the slums of the area.,0,0,True,"step 1: in the premise, the speaker expresses their admiration for the wealth of some people, mentioning that it's worth a detour to see it. this implies that the people with significant wealth live in the hills. no contradictory information is provided. step 2: the hypothesis stating 'the hills are basically the slums of the area' contradicts the premise because it suggests poverty and low living conditions in the hills, which is not indicated or even mentioned in the premise. step 3: based on the logical analysis, the hypothesis cannot be inferred from the premise as it contradicts the information provided."
6700,"Here, on the northernmost of the FWI, you'll find such familiar trappings as boulangeries, restaurants featuring delicate wine sauces, and gendarmes (if only a mere handful).",There are quaint shops and stands on the northernmost part of the FWI.  ,1,1,True,"step 1: in the premise, the author describes the northernmost part of the fwi as a place where one can find typical french elements such as boulangeries, restaurants, and gendarmes. this implies a quaint and charming atmosphere. step 2: the hypothesis, 'there are quaint shops and stands on the northernmost part of the fwi', aligns with the description in the premise. quaint shops and stands are common features of places where such french elements are present. step 3: based on the logical connection between the premise and hypothesis, and the common sense understanding that quaint shops and stands are likely to be found in areas with boulangeries, restaurants, and gendarmes, the hypothesis can be inferred from the premise."
6701,Room 17 houses a once private collection that of Irackliot doctor Stylianes Giamalakis which came to the state in 1962.,The collection in Room 17 is quite interesting to behold.,1,0,False,"step 1: the premise states that room 17 houses a private collection of dr. stylianes giamalakis, which became state property in 1962. the term 'quite interesting to behold' in the hypothesis is subjective and does not have a definitive factual meaning. however, there is no contradictory information provided in the premise that would negate the possibility of the collection being interesting.step 2: 'the collection in room 17 is quite interesting to behold' is not logically entailed by the premise as the premise only provides information about the origin and ownership of the collection, not any details about its intrigue or value.step 3: based on the given information, the hypothesis cannot be logically inferred from the premise. the subjective nature of the hypothesis makes it impossible to determine with certainty if it is true or false based on the provided premise alone."
6702,The teeming millions living in Calcutta and Mumbai have become legendary.,The millions of people living in Calcutta and Mumbai are legendary for their knife skills.,1,0,False,"step 1. in the premise, 'teeming millions' refers to a large population living in calcutta and mumbai. the phrase 'have become legendary' implies that these populations are known for something noteworthy or exceptional. step 2. the hypothesis suggests that the legendary status of these populations is related to their knife skills. however, there is no information in the premise that supports this claim, and there is no logical connection between the large population and the alleged knife skills. step 3. based on the given information, the hypothesis cannot be logically inferred from the premise."
6703,The Vatican was upset when the fascist youth movement dissolved the Catholic Boy Scouts.,The Catholic Boy Scouts were a fascist organization.,0,0,True,"step 1: the premise indicates that the vatican was upset when the catholic boy scouts were dissolved by the fascist youth movement. this implies that the catholic boy scouts were an organization affiliated with the catholic church that was disbanded by a fascist group. step 2: the hypothesis suggests that the catholic boy scouts were a fascist organization. this is a contradictory statement as it suggests that the very organization the vatican was upset about its disbanding was, in fact, a fascist organization itself. step 3: based on the logical analysis, the hypothesis cannot be inferred from the premise as it contradicts the information provided in the premise. the hypothesis suggests that the vatican was upset about the dissolution of a fascist organization, but the premise states that the vatican was upset about the dissolution of a catholic organization. these are two distinct and contradictory pieces of information."
6704,McGwire's 538-footer isn't the only questionable long ball of the season.,One of the questionable balls of the season is McGwire's 100 footer.,0,0,True,"step 1: in the premise, 'mcgwire's 538-footer' is described as one of the 'questionable long balls of the season'. this implies that there are other long balls of the season that are also questionable. 'questionable' suggests that there may be doubts about the validity or legitimacy of these home runs. step 2: the hypothesis proposes 'one of the questionable balls of the season is mcgwire's 100 footer'. this statement is logically consistent with the premise, as it does not contradict the premise's information and does not state anything that is factually incorrect. however, it is important to note that the hypothesis is not directly inferred from the premise, as the premise does not specifically mention 'mcgwire's 100 footer' among the questionable balls. step 3: based on the given information, the hypothesis cannot be logically inferred from the premise, as the hypothesis goes beyond the scope of the premise by specifically mentioning 'mcgwire's 100 footer' without any explicit indication in the premise. however, it's important to note that the premise does not exclude mcgwire's 100 footer as a questionable ball. therefore, the hypothesis is not contradictory to the premise and could be potentially true, but it's not logically entailed by the premise."
6705,It will offer weeknight and weekend calling for a flat rate of five cents per minute.,Weekends are going to be ten cents per minute.,0,0,True,"step 1. the premise describes a flat rate of five cents per minute for both weeknight and weekend calls. no specific information is given about the rates for weekends. step 2. the hypothesis proposes a different rate for weekend calls, which is ten cents per minute. this contradicts the information in the premise. step 3. based on the given information, the hypothesis cannot be logically inferred from the premise."
6706,uh that's a bad one they uh looks like we're going to have an income tax in Texas,That's a good one.,0,0,True,"step 1. in the premise, the speaker expresses a negative opinion about the prospect of having an income tax in texas. the hypothesis, on the other hand, is a neutral statement.step 2. the hypothesis does not logically follow from the premise. having a negative opinion about a tax policy does not entail having a positive opinion about it.step 3. based on the lack of a logical connection between the premise and hypothesis, and the differences in their meanings, the hypothesis cannot be inferred from the premise."
6707,"Specifically, reduced rates for books would be eliminated, and even if there were a separate subclass for them, it would not have rates that are invariant with distance.",A separate subclass for books is unlikely as the goal is partially to streamline the system.,1,1,True,"step 1: in the premise, it is stated that reduced rates for books would be eliminated and there would be no invariant rates with distance for a hypothetical separate subclass for books. this implies that managing a separate subclass for books would add complexity to the system. step 2: the hypothesis asserts that a separate subclass for books is unlikely. this hypothesis is consistent with the information in the premise since the elimination of reduced rates and the lack of invariant rates make managing a separate subclass less appealing. step 3: the goal of streamlining the system, as mentioned in the premise, could be hindered by introducing a new subclass with complex rate structures. thus, the hypothesis that a separate subclass for books is unlikely can be inferred from the premise."
6708,yeah i i'd actually been there um i was there a couple years ago when it wasn't as you know sort of dangerous to be out there i guess,"I haven't been there, but I've heard that it's always been safe.",0,0,True,"step 1: in the premise, the speaker states that they have been to a certain place 'a couple years ago.' this implies that they have firsthand knowledge of the situation. the statement 'it wasn't as you know sort of dangerous to be out there' suggests that the speaker is sharing their experience about the safety conditions at the time. step 2: the hypothesis, however, states that the speaker has not been there but has heard that it's always been safe. these two statements contradict each other, as the speaker's personal experience and the information in the hypothesis do not align. step 3: based on the given information, the hypothesis cannot be inferred from the premise because they are contradictory."
6709,"By the final confrontation with her husband, McTeer has so skillfully foreshadowed Nora's transformation that, though it seems bewilderingly abrupt to her, it seems emotionally inevitable to us.",We have a broader view on the events that would occur. ,1,1,True,"step 1: in the premise, mcteer's transformation during her final confrontation with her husband is described as skillfully foreshadowed and emotionally inevitable to the audience. this implies that there have been subtle hints or clues throughout the narrative that suggest mcteer's change in character, making her ultimate actions understandable to the audience despite appearing sudden to her. step 2: the hypothesis suggests having a broader view on the events, which could mean knowing additional context or details that were not explicitly stated in the premise but are necessary to fully understand mcteer's transformation. this broader view could consist of information about mcteer's background, motivations, or external factors that influenced her actions. step 3: given that the premise indicates that the audience is privy to this broader context, it can be inferred that the hypothesis is entailed by the premise. the hypothesis describes having a 'broader view' that makes mcteer's transformation 'emotionally inevitable,' which is exactly what the premise states. step 4: it is important to note that the hypothesis does not specify what this 'broader view' entails, and it could potentially include new information that contradicts the premise. however, without such contradictory information being provided, the hypothesis is a logical inference based on the information in the premise."
6710,"'In protective gear, possibly.'",Not in protective gear by any means.,0,0,True,"step 1: in the premise, the subject 'he' or 'she' is wearing protective gear 'possibly'. this means that there is a chance or uncertainty about whether protective gear is being worn. step 2: the hypothesis states that the person is 'not in protective gear by any means'. this statement contradicts the premise since it asserts that protective gear is definitely not being worn. step 3: based on the logical negation of the premise, the hypothesis is not entailed by the premise.step 4: it is important to note that the absence of information does not logically entail its negation. in other words, just because the premise does not explicitly state that protective gear is not being worn, it does not logically follow that the person is not wearing protective gear. the hypothesis makes a stronger claim than what is stated in the premise, and therefore, it cannot be logically inferred from the premise."
6711,So you will need to make at least some advance reservations for hotels in principal cities and especially for your major plane or train journeys.,It is unnecessary to make reservations for hotel rooms.,0,0,True,"step 1: in the premise, it is suggested that making reservations for hotels and major transportation is necessary, implying that without reservations, one may encounter difficulties. step 2: the hypothesis states that it is unnecessary to make reservations for hotel rooms. this directly contradicts the information in the premise. step 3: based on the logical reasoning, it is clear that the hypothesis is not entailed by the premise, as the hypothesis contradicts the information in the premise."
6712,She received basic training in music when her mother used to take her ' masterji ' for training.,She received basic training in music when her mother used to take her to a Hindustani music teacher or 'masterji' for training.,1,1,True,"step 1: in the premise, 'masterji' is mentioned as the person who provided her with basic music training. the term 'masterji' is commonly used in hindi language to refer to a teacher, especially in the context of traditional indian music. step 2: the hypothesis suggests that she received music training from a hindustani music teacher or 'masterji'. given the meaning of 'masterji' in this context, the hypothesis is consistent with the information in the premise. step 3: based on the logical consistency and the common usage of the term 'masterji' to refer to a music teacher in hindi, the hypothesis can be inferred from the premise."
6713,"Specifically, members were concerned that they might be held liable if other members took their advice and experienced negative results.", Members were concerned that they might not want to pay their membership fee anymore,1,0,False,"step 1: in the premise, members express concerns about potential liabilities arising from advice they give to other members. this implies a sense of responsibility and risk involved in being a member. the hypothesis suggests a different concern, that members might not want to pay their membership fee. while there seems to be a clear difference in subject matter between the premise and hypothesis, it's essential to consider if there is a logical connection.step 2: the hypothesis does not explicitly logically follow from the premise. however, it's possible to explore some potential indirect connections. for instance, if members feel they might be held liable for negative outcomes due to advice given, they could decide to cease their membership to avoid further risk or potential financial burdens. in this scenario, the hypothesis could be considered a possible consequence of the premise. however, the hypothesis does not have to be true for the premise to hold.step 3: based on the analysis, the hypothesis does not logically follow from the premise directly, but it could be a possible consequence or implication. however, the premise itself does not entail the hypothesis, as the concerns about liabilities and membership fees could be separate issues."
6714,National Saving Changed Over Time-Both47 Overview Overall and by Component?,The savings right has never changed.,0,0,True,"step 1. in the premise, 'national saving changed over time-both overall and by component?' indicates a question about how savings have varied over time in total and by different components. this implies that savings is a quantity that can change.step 2. the hypothesis, 'the savings right has never changed,' makes a claim that directly contradicts the premise. the hypothesis suggests that savings has been a constant quantity and not subject to change over time. udeditation: step 3. based on the information provided, the hypothesis cannot be logically inferred from the premise. in fact, the hypothesis contradicts the premise. the premise asks about changes in savings over time, while the hypothesis asserts that there have been no changes at all."
6715,"After a few skirmishes, the Catalonian troops were ready to deal the death blow.",The war took many years to reach this point.,1,0,False,"step 1: in the premise, 'a few skirmishes' indicates previous military confrontations between the catalonian troops and their opponents. 'ready to deal the death blow' implies that a decisive battle or resolution is imminent. however, this does not necessarily mean that the war started recently. in fact, it could be inferred that the war had been ongoing for some time and had reached a critical stage. step 2: the hypothesis 'the war took many years to reach this point' is consistent with the information in the premise. it does not contradict any facts stated and is a reasonable inference based on the context. step 3: based on the given context, it is plausible that the hypothesis can be inferred from the premise. while the premise does not directly state that the war had been ongoing for many years, it does not contradict this possibility. therefore, the hypothesis is not entailed by the premise, but it is a reasonable and likely conclusion based on the information given."
6716,oh those are fun,Those are the most fun I've had in years.,1,1,True,"step 1: in the premise, the speaker expresses enjoyment or fun with the use of the phrase 'those are fun'. this implies a positive experience or enjoyment. step 2: the hypothesis also expresses enjoyment or fun, but with the intensifier 'the most fun i've had in years'. this implies a particularly enjoyable or memorable experience. step 3: the hypothesis can be logically inferred from the premise because the more intense expression of fun does not contradict or change the basic meaning of the premise. in fact, it can be seen as an amplification or elaboration of the enjoyment mentioned in the premise. thus, the hypothesis follows logically from the premise. step 4: based on the logical reasoning and the lack of contradictory information, the hypothesis can be inferred from the premise."
6717,"Because the federal government frequently commingles aspects of insurance and guarantees within the same program, this Statement treats the terms as a single type of activity.",The federal government does not frequently work on insurance.,0,0,True,"step 1: in the premise, the focus is on the federal government's practice of commingling insurance aspects and guarantees within the same program. this implies that the government engages in insurance-related activities, but it does not explicitly state the frequency or extent of such activities. step 2: contrarily, the hypothesis claims that the federal government does not frequently work on insurance. this directly contradicts the information in the premise. step 3: based on this logical analysis, the hypothesis is not entailed by the premise."
6718,"It supports kernel threads, loading and running user programs, and a file system.","It supports kernel threads, loading and running user programs, and a file system, but it implements all of these in a very simple way.",1,0,False,"step 1: the premise describes a system that provides support for kernel threads, loading and running user programs, and a file system. these are essential components of an operating system. step 2: the hypothesis adds the additional detail that the system implements these components 'in a very simple way'. this does not contradict the information given in the premise, as the premise does not provide any specific information about the complexity of the implementation. step 3: based on the given information and lack of contradiction, the hypothesis can be inferred from the premise as a possible, but not necessary, condition."
6719,The point is not that the question is unfair.,The point is all about the question being unfair.  ,0,0,True,"step 1: the premise states that the point of a statement or discussion is not about the unfairness of a question. this implies that there might be other reasons or focuses for the point being made. step 2: the hypothesis suggests that the point is explicitly and solely about the unfairness of a question. a direct contradiction to the premise. step 3: based on the logical analysis, the hypothesis is not logically entailed by the premise as it contradicts it."
6720,um i wish i had,I want to undo what I did.,0,1,False,"step 1: in the premise, there is a first-person expression of a desire in the past tense for having something (presumably an object or action denoted by 'h'). in the hypothesis, there is a similar first-person expression of a desire, but this time for an action (undoing). the desires and the first-person perspective are common between the premise and hypothesis.step 2: the hypothesis can be inferred from the premise because of their similarity. while the premise is about a past desire, the hypothesis is about a current desire to undo that past action. this can be logically inferred as a natural consequence of having regrets about one's past actions.step 3: based on the logical reasoning and similarity between the two statements, the hypothesis can be inferred from the premise.step 4: it is important to note that the premise and hypothesis do not necessarily describe a situation or state that is objectively verifiable. they simply represent the speaker's thoughts and desires. thus, the analysis is based on the logical relationship between the two statements and the common sense understanding of human desires and regret."
6721,The defeat of English forces at the Battle of Hastings in 1066 enabled the Norman forces of France to assume royal power.,The defeat of English forces at the Battle of Wildlands in 1099 enabled the Norman forces of Italy to assume royal power.,0,0,True,"step 1: the premise describes an historical event where the defeat of english forces at the battle of hastings in 1066 led to the norman forces from france assuming royal power in england. this is a factual statement with no known contradictions. step 2: the hypothesis proposes a different event, the battle of wildlands in 1099, and a different location, italy, as the source of a norman force gaining royal power. however, the premise does not provide any information that can logically lead to this hypothesis. the hypothesis contradicts the premise because the norman forces mentioned in the hypothesis are from italy, not france. step 3: based on the information in the premise and the logical principle that the hypothesis must logically follow from the premise, the hypothesis cannot be inferred from the premise.step 4: it's important to note that the absence of evidence in the premise for the hypothesis does not necessarily mean the hypothesis is false. it just means it's not entailed by the premise."
6722,Gonna stomp all over any Blue Bellies as comes into this town?,Are you going to hide if any Blue Bellies dare come into town?,0,0,True,"step 1: in the premise, 'gonna stomp all over any blue bellies as comes into this town' is a statement expressing a threat or intent to harm 'any blue bellies' who enter the town. the term 'blue bellies' is not explicitly defined, but it implies a negative or threatening context. step 2: the hypothesis, 'are you going to hide if any blue bellies dare come into town', is asking about a different action: hiding rather than attacking. this action is not logically related to the premise's content of attacking. step 3: based on the logical relationship between the premise and hypothesis, the hypothesis is not logically entailed by the premise. the premise describes an intent to harm, while the hypothesis describes an intent to hide."
6723,Jon's feeling of age and weariness must have shown.,Jon had traveled longer than his body could handle.,1,1,True,"step 1: in the premise, 'jon's feeling of age and weariness' implies that jon appeared older or more tired than usual. this could be due to various reasons, including extended travel.step 2: the hypothesis 'jon had traveled longer than his body could handle' offers an explanation for jon's age and weariness. it suggests that the cause of his appearance was a result of his body being unable to cope with the prolonged journey. given that traveling can take a toll on a person's body, this explanation is plausible and logically consistent with the premise.step 3: based on the provided information, the hypothesis can be inferred from the premise as it offers a reasonable explanation for jon's age and weariness."
6724,i voted in the last national one yeah i'm not sure if i got the last local one,I'm fairly sure I got to vote in the last local one.,0,0,True,"step 1: in the premise, the person states they voted in the last national election but expresses uncertainty about their participation in the last local election. this creates a potential gap in information between the two elections. however, the premise does not provide any factual contradictions or inconsistencies. step 2: the hypothesis suggests that the person is fairly confident about having voted in the last local election, which could be considered a weaker claim than a definitive statement of fact (having 'gotten to vote' versus 'being fairly sure'). however, it does not contradict the premise, as the premise's uncertainty applies specifically to the local election. step 3: based on the given information, the hypothesis cannot be logically inferred from the premise as there is a lack of certainty in both statements. however, it is not a contradiction either. the hypothesis is a weaker claim that falls within the realm of possibility based on the premise."
6725,"I thought those were lost, said Ca'daan behind them.",Ca'daan ran up ahead.,0,0,True,"step 1: the premise indicates that ca'daan made a statement 'i thought those were lost' while looking at certain objects. this statement suggests that ca'daan believed that the objects were missing. it does not provide any direct information about ca'daan's actions or location relative to those objects, nor does it mention anything about ca'daan running up ahead.step 2: the hypothesis asserts that ca'daan ran up ahead. this action cannot be logically inferred from the premise, as there is no connection between the two statements. the hypothesis introduces new information that is not mentioned in the premise.step 3: based on the given information, the hypothesis is not entailed by the premise."
6726,Crimson drapes.,blue blinds,0,0,True,"step 1: in the premise, 'crimson drapes' are described. this refers to a type of fabric, often used for window coverings or decorative purposes. the hypothesis, 'blue blinds', describes a different type of window covering, specifically 'blinds' in the color 'blue'. step 2: there is no logical connection between the premise and hypothesis. the colors of the window coverings mentioned in each sentence are different, and one does not inherently lead to the other. step 3: based on the given information, the hypothesis cannot be logically inferred from the premise."
6727,The old bird-cage lift will take you up to the second-floor museum for a look at the suite used by Ataturk.,"The old bird cage lift broke yesterday, killing three people, it's closed down now.",0,0,True,"step 1: in the premise, there is an old bird-cage lift that functions to take people to the second-floor museum. no specific information about its condition or recent events is provided. step 2: in the hypothesis, it is stated that the old bird cage lift broke yesterday, killing three people, and is now closed down. this information contradicts the premise as it suggests the lift is currently inoperable and poses a danger, which is not indicated in the premise. step 3: based on the logical contradiction between the premise and hypothesis, the hypothesis cannot be logically inferred from the premise."
6728,"But designing a machine to handle the planets and the sun, while a lot simpler, was still a complex problem.",A machine to handle the planets and the sun was impossible to conceive of.,0,0,True,"step 1: in the premise, the speaker acknowledges that designing a machine to handle the planets and the sun is a complex problem, but does not indicate that it is impossible. the use of the word 'simpler' implies that it is a challenging task, but one that is still feasible.step 2: the hypothesis proposes that a machine to handle the planets and the sun was impossible to conceive of. this is a stronger claim than what is stated in the premise.step 3: the hypothesis contradicts the premise because the premise does not indicate that the task is impossible, only complex. therefore, the hypothesis cannot be logically inferred from the premise.step 4: it's important to note that the premise does not provide enough information to definitively prove or disprove the hypothesis. the hypothesis makes a broader claim about what was impossible to conceive of, not just a machine to handle the planets and the sun.step 5: based on the given premise, there is not enough evidence to infer that the hypothesis is entailed by the premise."
6729,This is because the permitting activities might become the time-limiting steps.,"If permitting activities become time limited steps, it will halt progress. ",1,1,True,"step 1: in the premise, 'permitting activities might become the time-limiting steps' implies that these activities could significantly delay the completion of a project. this is a common situation in many projects, where obtaining necessary permits can cause delays. step 2: the hypothesis 'if permitting activities become time-limiting steps, it will halt progress' logically follows from the premise. a delay, especially one caused by time-limiting steps, can be assumed to halt progress since work cannot be completed during that time. step 3: based on the logical connection between the premise and hypothesis, the hypothesis can be inferred from the premise."
6730,"(Financial Accounting Standards Board, Statement of Financial Accounting Standard No.",The standard is for environmental control.,0,1,False,"step 1: fasb (financial accounting standards board) is an independent, private-sector organization that establishes and improves financial accounting and reporting standards for the preparation and dissemination of financial reports. these standards govern the preparation and disclosure of financial information that companies report to the investing public. the term 'environmental control' is related to maintaining an effective system of controls to ensure accurate, reliable financial reporting.step 2: the hypothesis suggests a specific area of application for fasb's standards, which is environmental control. this is a reasonable inference because maintaining effective financial controls to ensure accurate reporting is an essential aspect of financial accounting and reporting standards. the hypothesis does not contradict the premise as it is a specific application of the broader 'financial accounting and reporting standards' mentioned in the premise.step 3: based on the logical reasoning and the lack of contradictory information, the hypothesis can be inferred from the premise as it refers to a specific application or area of focus within the broader scope of fasb's financial accounting and reporting standards."
6731,"The preambles to the proposed rules contained the required information regarding the reasons for the collections, the parties affected, and the estimated annual burden hours.",All questions can be answered through the information contained within the proposed rules.,1,1,True,"step 1: the premise states that the preambles to the proposed rules contain necessary information such as reasons for collections, affected parties, and estimated annual burden hours. this implies that the preambles provide context and background information about the rules.step 2: the hypothesis suggests that all questions can be answered through the information contained within the proposed rules. this is a stronger claim than what is stated in the premise, as the premise only mentions that certain required information is present, not that it is sufficient to answer all possible questions.step 3: however, if we consider common sense reasoning and the context provided in the premise, it can be inferred that the required information mentioned in the premise is likely to be comprehensive enough to answer many questions related to the rules. for instance, the reasons for the collections and the affected parties are crucial pieces of information that would help answer many potential questions. the presence of estimated annual burden hours further suggests a level of detail that would likely address several queries.therefore, even though the hypothesis is a stronger claim than what is stated in the premise, it is reasonable to infer that it is entailed by the premise based on the provided context and common sense reasoning.step 4: additionally, there is no contradictory information in the hypothesis that would negate the premise, making the entailment relationship clear.step 5: based on the logical reasoning, common sense, and lack of contradictory facts, the hypothesis can be inferred from the premise."
6732,Outstanding in the ground floor collections are the vast canvases of Gustave Courbet.,Gustave Courbet's work is only featured on the second floor.,0,0,True,"step 1: in the premise, it is stated that gustave courbet's works are outstanding in the ground floor collections. this implies that the ground floor contains some of the most notable pieces by gustave courbet. step 2: the hypothesis, however, suggests that gustave courbet's works are only present on the second floor. this contradicts the information provided in the premise, as the premise states that the ground floor contains outstanding works by gustave courbet. step 3: based on the logical analysis, the hypothesis cannot be inferred from the premise, as the premise and hypothesis are in direct contradiction."
6733,"Aurangzeb streamlined the lax administration of his predecessors, but he almost bankrupted the realm with his campaigns to expand the empire down to the south, and his battles against rebels in the north.","Aurangzeb made the administration inefficient and loathsome, but succeeded in increasing the wealth of the country.",0,0,True,"step 1: in the premise, aurangzeb is described as having streamlined the administration, but this was also accompanied by significant costs such as his campaigns in the south and battles against rebels in the north which almost bankrupted the realm. step 2: the hypothesis suggests that aurangzeb made the administration inefficient and loathsome, but managed to increase the wealth of the country. this contradicts the premise as it presents two opposing ideas about the impact of aurangzeb's actions on the administration and the country's wealth. step 3: based on the given information, the hypothesis cannot be logically inferred from the premise as they present conflicting statements."
6735,"But to refuse, after Topham had spoken for him ... he was caught in a pinch with cause for suspicion closing in on either side.",There were no suspicion on either sides.,0,0,True,"step 1: the premise describes a situation where topham spoke on behalf of someone, who was then put in a difficult position with suspicion closing in from both sides. it does not provide any information about the presence or absence of suspicion before this point. step 2: the hypothesis states that there was no suspicion on either side. this contradicts the information given in the premise, as the premise explicitly mentions the presence of suspicion. step 3: based on the provided information, the hypothesis cannot be logically inferred from the premise."
6736,She failed to finish.,"She competed in the women's event at the 2015 Pan American Games, but failed to finish.",1,1,True,"step 1: in the premise, 'she failed to finish' indicates that the subject did not complete a certain task. this information does not limit the context or domain of the task. step 2: the hypothesis expands the context of the premise by specifying that the task was participating in the women's event at the 2015 pan american games. this additional information does not contradict the premise, as 'failing to finish' can occur in various types of competitions. step 3: the hypothesis can be inferred from the premise because the premise does not restrict the task to any specific context, and the hypothesis provides a specific context without contradicting the information in the premise."
26,"A few hours after Japan's attack on the American fleet at Pearl Harbor in December 1941, a dozen Japanese battalions began an assault on Hong Kong; Hong Kong's minimal air force was destroyed on the airfield at Kai Tak within five minutes.",Both attacks were coordinated by the same person.,1,0,False,"step 1: in the premise, we have separate japanese military actions: the attack on pearl harbor and the assault on hong kong. the premise provides no information about any individual being responsible for coordinating both attacks. it is a common understanding that large-scale military operations, especially those involving multiple geographical locations, are usually coordinated by high-ranking military or political leaders. however, the premise itself does not provide any such information.step 2: the hypothesis 'both attacks were coordinated by the same person' is a significant leap from the information given in the premise. there is no direct evidence in the premise that supports this hypothesis. in fact, the premise explicitly states that we have separate japanese battalions involved in each attack, which does not imply a single coordinator. additionally, historical records indicate that the attacks on pearl harbor and hong kong were planned and executed by different military commanders acting independently.step 3: based on the given information, we cannot logically infer that 'both attacks were coordinated by the same person'. the hypothesis is not entailed by the premise."
39,"You will find that each quartier has its own personality, different people to watch, and something special to offer.","Each quartier has the same people, with nothing particularly special on offer.",0,0,True,"step 1: in the premise, it is stated that each quartier has its own personality, different people, and something special to offer. this implies that there is variation in the people and offerings across different quartiers. step 2: the hypothesis contradicts the premise by suggesting that all quartiers have the same people and nothing particularly special to offer. step 3: given the information provided, the hypothesis cannot be logically inferred from the premise as it contradicts it. the premise suggests diversity and uniqueness among quartiers, while the hypothesis suggests uniformity and lack of uniqueness."
73,She fled and she showed it to me.,She stayed right where she was.,0,0,True,"step 1: the premise describes an action sequence where 'she' first fled and then showed something to the speaker. there's no specific information about her location before or after these actions. step 2: the hypothesis suggests an opposite scenario, where 'she' stayed in place instead of fleeing. this suggestion contradicts the information in the premise. step 3: based on the logical negation of the premise's information, the hypothesis cannot be inferred from it."
101,"To get your bearings, picture Paris as a circle, with the river Seine threading across the center, flanked by famous landmarks Notre-Dame, the Louvre, place de la Concorde, Arc de Triomphe, the Tour Eiffel.",The river Seine runs around the outside of Paris.,0,0,True,"step 1: the premise describes paris as a circle with the river seine running through the center. the description 'running through the center' implies that the river is passing through paris, not surrounding it. common sense and factual knowledge also support this interpretation, as the seine does not encircle paris, but instead flows through its heart. step 2: the hypothesis states that the river seine runs around the outside of paris. however, the premise does not provide enough information to infer that the river encircles paris, only that it passes through it. the hypothesis contradicts the premise. step 3: based on the logical reasoning and factual inconsistency between the premise and hypothesis, the hypothesis is not entailed by the premise."
232,and so as as and the people in the country don't want as much as the people in the city,Country people don't want as much drama as those in the city do.,1,1,True,"step 1. the premise is stating that there is a difference in desire for 'as much' between people from the country and people from the city. step 2. the hypothesis is making a specific assumption about what 'as much' refers to in this context - 'drama'. since the premise does not define 'as much', and the hypothesis is a reasonable interpretation of the premise based on common sense understanding, we can consider it as an entailed hypothesis. step 3. based on the logical reasoning and common sense interpretation, the hypothesis is entailed by the premise."
240,um-hum yeah that's what she does yeah that's right,"No, you're wrong, she doesn't do that.",0,0,True,"step 1: in this example, the premise does not provide clear and explicit information that can be directly related to the hypothesis. the premise appears to be a series of agreement noises without any identifiable content. the hypothesis, on the other hand, denies the premise. step 2: since there is no identifiable information in the premise that can logically lead to the hypothesis, and the hypothesis contradicts the premise, it cannot be logically inferred. moreover, the lack of explicit information in the premise makes it impossible to determine if there is any factual basis for the hypothesis. step 3: based on the absence of clear and logical connections between the premise and hypothesis, and the contradictory nature of the hypothesis, it cannot be inferred from the premise."
241,5 are highly correlated during summer months in some areas.,Six are correlated to winter in certain areas.  ,0,0,True,"step 1: in the premise, '5 are highly correlated during summer months in some areas' implies that there is a significant relationship between the occurrence or level of '5' and the summer season in certain locations. the correlation does not specify a causal relationship or limit the correlation to only two variables, allowing for the possibility of additional factors influencing the correlation. step 2: the hypothesis 'six are correlated to winter in certain areas' suggests a different correlation in which 'six' is related to the winter season in specific locations. the hypothesis does not contradict the premise as it introduces a new correlation involving a different variable. however, it does not logically follow from the premise as there is no mention of 'six' in the premise and no direct connection between 'five' and 'six' in this context. step 3: based on the given information, the hypothesis is not logically entailed by the premise. logical entailment would require the hypothesis to result directly from the premise, which is not the case here."
246,"The latter dates back to 1890s, while the present facade was built in the 1950s, with the temple still home to a group of monks and nuns.",The latter dates back to 1860s.,0,0,True,"step 1: in the premise, 'the latter' refers to an element or part of the temple that existed prior to the construction of the present facade in the 1950s. the given date is 1890s. step 2: the hypothesis suggests that 'the latter' dates back to an earlier decade, specifically the 1860s. step 3: based on the information provided, there is no logical connection or entailment relationship between the premise and hypothesis. the hypothesis contradicts the premise because it suggests an earlier date than what is stated in the premise. therefore, the hypothesis cannot be logically inferred from the premise."
248,right i have a sister that can can uh crochet real well or or knit i i guess i mean knit and she knits things like hats and uh sweaters an you know,My sister can crochet anything.,0,1,False,"step 1: in the premise, it is stated that the sister can knit things like hats and sweaters. knitting is a type of craft that involves manipulating yarn with needles to create fabric. crochet is another type of yarn craft where a hook is used to create fabric. while knitting and crochet have some differences, they share many similarities, and a person skilled in knitting can often learn to crochet with relative ease. furthermore, it's a common assumption that if someone can knit, they can also crochet, as both skills involve the manipulation of yarn to create fabric.step 2: the hypothesis, 'my sister can crochet anything,' can be logically inferred from the premise, 'my sister can knit things like hats and sweaters,' because the ability to knit implies the ability to crochet, given the similarities between the two crafts and the fact that someone who can perform one skill may reasonably be expected to be able to perform the other.step 3: based on the logical reasoning, the assumption that similar skills often imply related abilities, and the absence of contradictory information, the hypothesis, 'my sister can crochet anything,' can be inferred from the premise."
267,"On the Place de la Cathedrale, at the beginning of the Rue Merciyre, stands the 13th-century Pharmacie du Cerf, older than the cathedral and reputedly the oldest pharmacy in France.",The Place de la Cathedrale is located at the end of the Rue Merciyre. ,0,0,True,"step 1: in the premise, we have specific information about the location of the pharmacie du cerf, stating that it is located at the beginning of the rue merciyre and on the place de la cathedrale. this implies that the place de la cathedrale is a location where the rue merciyre starts. step 2: the hypothesis suggests that the place de la cathedrale is located at the end of the rue merciyre. however, this contradicts the information given in the premise as the place de la cathedrale is where the rue merciyre begins, not ends. step 3: based on the logical contradiction between the premise and hypothesis, the hypothesis cannot be logically inferred from the premise."
280,um-hum that's kind of sad well anyway well i guess i better go,"That's good to hear, let me stay awhile.",0,0,True,"step 1: the premise appears to be a part of a conversation between two people, and the speaker seems to be expressing a desire to leave. there's no specific information about any actions or events related to the hypothesis. step 2: the hypothesis expresses a desire for the speaker to stay. while it's possible for both sentences to be part of the same conversation, they don't logically follow one another. for example, the speaker might have initially expressed a wish to stay but then changed their mind and decided to leave. or, they might have made the comment about the sadness as a response to the hypothesis. step 3: based on the information provided, there's no clear logical relationship between the premise and hypothesis. therefore, the hypothesis cannot be inferred from the premise."
297,"He is, on the contrary, a patriot. ","That's correct, he is not a patriot.",0,0,True,"step 1: in the premise, 'he is, on the contrary' indicates a contradiction. 'he is, on the contrary' suggests that there is a previous assumption or belief about the subject that is being contradicted. 'a patriot' refers to someone who loves, supports, and defends their country.step 2: the hypothesis, 'that's correct, he is not a patriot', contradicts the premise. if the premise says that 'he is, on the contrary, a patriot', then the hypothesis, 'he is not a patriot', directly contradicts it.step 3: based on the given information, the hypothesis cannot be logically inferred from the premise as they contradict each other."
319,"A white dog, a brown dog, and a black dog frolicking in a grassy field.",The dogs are eating their dinner in the kitchen.,0,0,True,"step 1. in the premise, we have information about the location (grassy field) and the dogs' identities (white, brown, black). there's no mention of the dogs eating or any other action related to dinner. common sense and logical connections do not suggest that dogs are eating their dinner in a grassy field based on the given information.step 2. the hypothesis 'the dogs are eating their dinner in the kitchen' contradicts the premise. if the dogs were in the kitchen eating, they wouldn't be in a grassy field.step 3. based on the information provided, the hypothesis 'the dogs are eating their dinner in the kitchen' cannot be logically inferred from the premise 'a white dog, a brown dog, and a black dog are frolicking in a grassy field'."
324,"In addition to the normal problems associated with adapting to new standards, several of these standards provide for a transition period during which agencies may or, in some cases, may not report investments in human capital, research and development and nonfederal physical property; if investments are reported for each of five years as called for in this statement, they may be reported for earlier years during the transition period on the basis of either outlays or expense.",These standards force businesses to announce their investments in human capital.,0,0,True,"step 1: the premise describes certain standards that allow for a transition period during which agencies may choose not to report their investments in human capital, research and development, and nonfederal physical property. the investments can be reported during the transition period based on outlays or expense. this indicates that there is a reporting requirement for these investments at some point, but it does not mention anything about these reports being made public.step 2: the hypothesis goes beyond the information provided in the premise by stating that these standards force businesses to announce their investments in human capital. this is not a logical inference from the premise, as the premise does not mention any requirement for public announcements of these investments.step 3: based on the information provided, the hypothesis is not logically entailed by the premise. the hypothesis adds an additional requirement (public announcement) that is not stated or implied in the premise."
355,do you buy them um separately at you know an American grocery store now or do you have to or you don't you don't go buy it from a a wholesaler,Did you find it at the thrift shop?,0,0,True,"step 1. in the premise, the speaker is asking if they can buy 'them' (presumably an item or items) separately at an american grocery store, or if they have to buy it from a wholesaler. no specific information is given about the identity or nature of the items in question, or about the thrift shop mentioned in the hypothesis.step 2. the hypothesis, 'did you find it at the thrift shop?' does not logically follow from the premise. the premise describes where and how the speaker might be able to purchase an item, while the hypothesis asks about a different location, the thrift shop, and does not provide any information about the items or their potential purchase locations.step 3. based on the lack of logical connection between the premise and hypothesis, and the fact that the hypothesis provides no information that can be inferred from the premise, it is reasonable to conclude that the hypothesis is not entailed by the premise."
397,"Yanzhou or Yan Prefecture was a ""zhou"" (prefecture) in imperial China centering on modern Yanzhou District, Jining, Shandong, China.","Salem or Yan Prefecture was a ""zhou"" (prefecture) in imperial China centering on modern Salem District, Jining, Shandong, China.",1,1,True,"step 1: in the premise, yanzhou or yan prefecture is identified as a 'zhou' (prefecture) in imperial china located in modern yanzhou district, jining, shandong, china. the hypothesis suggests that salem or yan prefecture is another 'zhou' in imperial china, located in modern salem district, jining, shandong, china. both are prefectures in the same historical context, same region, and time period.step 2: the hypothesis is consistent with the premise, as both sentences describe 'zhou' (prefectures) in imperial china in the same region. the difference is only in the names of the specific prefectures being discussed.step 3: based on the information provided, the hypothesis can be logically inferred from the premise as they both describe 'zhou' (prefectures) in the same region during the same time period in imperial china."
402,"Norman Metzger (Indiana) and Janet Millard (Wyoming) facilitated this session, which included defining the term statewide and discussion of various statewide program models.",Norman Metzger could not make it for the session.,0,0,True,"step 1: in the premise, norman metzger is mentioned as one of the facilitators of the session. no information is given about his attendance or absence during the session. step 2: the hypothesis does not logically follow from the premise, as the premise does not indicate whether norman metzger was present or not during the session. the hypothesis contradicts the premise if we assume the premise to be true in its entirety. step 3: based on the given information, the hypothesis cannot be inferred from the premise."
421,"For readers who know a handicapped child or have an aging parent, for example, a case study report of conditions in residential care for the severely handicapped or the aged may compare dramatically with vivid personal experiences.",Residential care conditions could be much better.,1,0,False,"step 1: the premise describes a comparison between reports of residential care conditions and personal experiences, suggesting a potential disparity. it does not specify the nature of the disparity, but it implies that the personal experiences could be better than the reported conditions. step 2: the hypothesis proposes that residential care conditions could be 'much better'. this is a stronger statement than the premise, which only implies a possible disparity. however, the hypothesis is not contradictory to the premise, as 'much better' conditions could still be implied by 'compare dramatically with vivid personal experiences'. step 3: based on the given information, the hypothesis is not logically entailed by the premise. however, it is not a contradiction either. the premise leaves open the possibility for improved conditions, which is what the hypothesis proposes."
453,The present in the United States requirement applies to both the unrestricted categories and to H-2A workers.,The United States policies were influenced by British origins.,1,0,False,"step 1: in the premise, it is stated that the united states requirement applies to both unrestricted categories and h-2a workers. this implies that there is a specific requirement in place that affects all categories of workers. this information does not provide any details about the origin or influence of this requirement. the hypothesis suggests a possible origin of this requirement being influenced by british policies. step 2: to determine if the hypothesis can be logically inferred from the premise, there must be a clear logical connection between the two. however, the premise does not provide any information about the origin or influence of the united states requirement. the hypothesis is not logically inferred from the premise as the premise does not contain the necessary information to make that inference. step 3: based on the given information, the hypothesis cannot be logically inferred from the premise."
463,The young woman wearing a striped pink shirt is approaching the stone-block stairs.,A young woman in a grey tank-top passes by the stairs,0,0,True,"step 1: the premise describes a young woman wearing a striped pink shirt who is approaching the stone-block stairs. this information sets the scene and identifies the subject of the premise. step 2: the hypothesis describes a different young woman, this time wearing a grey tank-top, who is passing by the stairs. there is no direct logical connection between the premise and hypothesis based on the given information.step 3: the hypothesis cannot be logically inferred from the premise as it describes a different individual with distinct clothing. therefore, the hypothesis is not entailed by the premise."
468,what kind of weather you having right now,They news forecast said that we would have cloudy weather right now.,1,0,False,"step 1: in the premise, the speaker is asking about the current weather. this question implies that the speaker is interested in knowing the current meteorological conditions. in the hypothesis, it is stated that the news forecast predicted cloudy weather. both the premise and hypothesis deal with the topic of weather.step 2: the hypothesis does not directly follow from the premise as it introduces an external source of information (the news forecast). however, if we have context or additional information indicating that the speaker is referring to the news forecast when they ask about the weather, then the hypothesis can be inferred from the premise. for instance, if we know that the speaker frequently checks the news forecast before going out, then it would be reasonable to infer that the speaker is referring to the forecast when they ask about the weather.step 3: in the absence of additional context, the hypothesis cannot be logically inferred from the premise. however, if context exists suggesting that the speaker's question is about a specific forecast, then the hypothesis could be inferred."
470,"The General Accounting Office, the investigative arm of Congress, exists to support Congress in meeting its constitutional responsibilities and to help improve the performance and accountability of the federal government for the American people.",The General Accounting office has nothing to do with Congress.,0,0,True,"step 1: in the premise, the general accounting office (gao) is identified as an investigative arm of congress. this relationship is crucial to understanding the context of the premise. there is no factual or logical inconsistency in the premise.step 2: the hypothesis 'the general accounting office has nothing to do with congress' directly contradicts the premise. the relationship between gao and congress is central to the definition and role of gao as stated in the premise.step 3: based on the logical analysis, the hypothesis 'the general accounting office has nothing to do with congress' cannot be inferred from the premise as it contradicts the established relationship between gao and congress."
481,"Below Jesus' feet is a Latin in?­scription that suggests that the tympanum was the work of one man, Gislebertus (Gilbert).",Gisleburtus destroyed the tympanum of Jesus.,0,0,True,"step 1: in the premise, we have a description of an inscription below jesus' feet attributing the creation of the tympanum to gislebertus. the hypothesis suggests the opposite, that gislebertus destroyed the tympanum. both statements refer to gislebertus and the tympanum, but they convey conflicting actions.step 2: the hypothesis cannot be logically inferred from the premise because the actions described in each are contrary. the premise indicates that gislebertus created the tympanum, while the hypothesis suggests that he destroyed it.step 3: based on the logical analysis, the hypothesis is not entailed by the premise. in fact, the hypothesis contradicts the premise."
483,A black dog jumps over an obstacle.,Cats are chasing each other with dog eating hats,0,0,True,"step 1. in the premise, we have a black dog jumping over an obstacle. this sentence describes a simple action performed by the dog. there is no additional context provided about the reason for the dog's action or any relationship to cats or hats.step 2. the hypothesis states 'cats are chasing each other with dog eating hats'. this sentence describes a completely different scenario from the premise, involving cats chasing each other while wearing dog-eating hats. there is no logical connection between the premise and the hypothesis.step 3. based on the information provided in the premise and hypothesis, there is no way to logically infer the hypothesis from the premise. the hypothesis introduces new entities (cats and hats) and actions (chasing each other with hats) that are not present or implied in the premise. therefore, the hypothesis is not entailed by the premise."
490,yeah they were my favorite team for a while,They were always the worst team ever.,0,0,True,"step 1: in the premise, the speaker expresses a preference for a particular team at some point in time. preference does not imply that the team was objectively the best, only that it was favored by the speaker. step 2: the hypothesis states that the team was 'always' the worst. this is a contradiction to the premise, as the premise does not state or imply that the team was always the worst. step 3: based on the contradictory nature of the hypothesis and the premise, the hypothesis cannot be logically inferred from the premise."
497,Two elderly men are sitting on a boat that appears to be traveling down a river in the middle of the forest.,Two woman are drinking alcohol and getting twisted,0,0,True,"step 1. in the premise, we have a scene of two elderly men on a boat in a forested area, traveling down a river. there is no information about what the men are doing or carrying, and the river and forest setting is not particularly relevant to the hypothesis. step 2. the hypothesis proposes a scenario of two women engaging in the behavior of drinking alcohol and getting 'twisted' (which can be interpreted as being drunk). this hypothesis does not follow logically from the premise as there is no information in the premise about women or alcohol being present. step 3. based on the lack of any logical connection or common sense reasoning between the premise and hypothesis, and the absence of relevant information in the premise for the hypothesis to be inferred, the hypothesis is not entailed by the premise."
508,Nobody ever wanted to emulate this effect,Everyone wanted to repeat this effect.,0,0,True,"step 1: the premise states that 'nobody ever wanted to emulate this effect'. this means that there is no record or evidence of anyone desiring to replicate this effect. step 2: the hypothesis, 'everyone wanted to repeat this effect', contradicts the premise as it suggests an opposite situation. there is a clear logical contradiction between the two statements. step 3: based on the given information, the hypothesis 'everyone wanted to repeat this effect' cannot be logically inferred from the premise 'nobody ever wanted to emulate this effect'."
563,well you know it's it's real funny because when i first started it was like i saw someone at a Halloween party this lady was from Turkey and she'd been belly dancing since she was four years old you know so i thought well jeez you know that looks like fun i'll learn that in a couple of weeks ha,The woman I met at the Halloween party was from Atlanta.,0,0,True,"step 1: in the premise, the speaker is sharing an anecdote about meeting a woman at a halloween party who is a belly dancer from turkey. the hypothesis presents a different location for the woman's origin, atlanta. step 2: the hypothesis contradicts the premise, as the given information states the woman is from turkey, while the hypothesis suggests she is from atlanta. no logical connection can be established between the premise and hypothesis based on the provided information. there is no common-sense reasoning or factual consistency that would allow the hypothesis to be inferred from the premise. step 3: based on the contradictory nature of the hypothesis and the premise, the hypothesis is not entailed by the premise."
586,"Newt Gingrich said that if the evidence holds up, the United States should consider a military strike against Iran.",Newt Gingrinch is against all violence in Iran,0,0,True,"step 1: newt gingrich's statement in the premise indicates that he has suggested a military strike against iran based on certain evidence. this is a clear expression of his position in favor of using military force in this situation. step 2: the hypothesis, on the other hand, asserts that newt gingrich is 'against all violence in iran.' this is a direct contradiction to his position in the premise. step 3: based on the provided information, it is not logically possible for the hypothesis to be inferred from the premise. the hypothesis states something that is not supported by, and indeed contradicts, the information given in the premise."
601,"Herbert Gutman's The Black Family in Slavery and Freedom 1750-1925 (1976) showed that slave families, while often broken up when members were sold or assigned to different plantations, were remarkably monogamous and stable.",Gutman's work talked about how dysfunctional slave families were.,0,0,True,"step 1: in the premise, gutman's study is described as showing that slave families were more monogamous and stable than commonly believed. this means that most families remained together, with relatively few instances of separation or instability. step 2: the hypothesis, stating that gutman's work talked about how dysfunctional slave families were, contradicts the premise. gutman's findings were about the stability and monogamy of slave families, whereas the hypothesis suggests an emphasis on dysfunction. step 3: based on the information provided, the hypothesis is not entailed by the premise. the premise describes the actual findings in gutman's work, while the hypothesis presents an incorrect or contradictory interpretation."
611,These people simply decided a man was well and ordered him out.,The people only cared about men they thought were not well. ,1,0,False,"step 1: the premise describes a situation where people made a judgment about a man's health and subsequently asked him to leave. this action suggests they believed the man was not well enough to remain. step 2: the hypothesis, on the other hand, states that the people only cared about men they thought were not well. this can be seen as a possible explanation for their behavior in the premise, as their decision to ask the man to leave could be based on their perception that he was not well. however, the hypothesis goes beyond the information provided in the premise, as it implies that the people did not care about well men. step 3: while the hypothesis can be seen as a plausible interpretation of the premise, it is not logically entailed by the premise alone. the premise does not provide enough information to definitively establish that the people only cared about men they thought were not well."
626,when you rent the home do they uh force you to lease and guarantee payment,The house is not available for rent or lease. ,0,0,True,"step 1: the premise discusses a situation where one is required to lease and guarantee payment when renting a home. this implies that the home is indeed available for rent or lease.step 2: the hypothesis states that the house is not available for rent or lease. this contradicts the information presented in the premise.  the hypothesis cannot be logically inferred from the premise as it contradicts the key information provided.step 3: based on the logical analysis, the hypothesis is not entailed by the premise."
643,"Close by the bridge is the Mus??e Courbet, in his childhood home, with the old walking stick depicted in his famous painting Bonjour Monsieur Courbet.",His childhood home was very beautiful which is why he featured it in his paintings.,1,1,True,"step 1: in the premise, we have the information that the musée courbet, where courbet lived in his childhood, is located close to the bridge and that the walking stick depicted in his famous painting bonjour monsieur courbet is also present there. this information does not contradict the hypothesis. there is no explicit statement in the premise about the beauty of the childhood home, but there is no information that would suggest otherwise.step 2: the hypothesis asserts that the childhood home was beautiful, which is a reasonable assumption based on the information in the premise. artists often draw inspiration from their childhood homes and surroundings, and it is common for them to feature such places in their works. the fact that courbet chose to include the walking stick from his childhood home in his painting suggests a deep connection and fondness for the place. this connection and fondness can be inferred as a reason for featuring the childhood home in his paintings, and thus, the beauty of the home can be reasonably inferred.step 3: based on the logical reasoning and common sense, the hypothesis can be inferred from the premise."
649,The Palladian-style Rotunda was built by Richard Castle in 1751 1755; it's Europe's oldest maternity hospital.,The Rotunda is one of the newer maternity hospitals in Europe.,0,0,True,"step 1: in the premise, we have a statement about the construction of the rotunda by richard castle in the years 1751 to 1755 and its status as europe's oldest maternity hospital. this information does not contradict each other, as a building can be the oldest of a certain type even if it is not the newest overall. however, the phrase 'europe's oldest maternity hospital' implies that the rotunda is oldest amongst all maternity hospitals in europe. step 2: the hypothesis 'the rotunda is one of the newer maternity hospitals in europe' directly contradicts the information given in the premise. if the rotunda is europe's oldest maternity hospital, it cannot be one of the newer ones. step 3: based on the logical contradiction between the premise and hypothesis, it is clear that the hypothesis cannot be logically inferred from the premise."
660,"The North Carolina Farm Bureau stated that since 1983, it had never complained that an LSC recipient was improperly representing aliens who were no longer in the United States.","in 1990, four North Carolinian, LSC recipients represented aliens residing in Equador.",0,0,True,"step 1: the premise states that the north carolina farm bureau had never complained about lsc recipients representing aliens who were no longer in the united states since 1983. this indicates a consistent pattern of the farm bureau not raising concerns about this issue.step 2: the hypothesis claims that in 1990, four north carolinian lsc recipients represented aliens residing in equador. this statement does not contradict the premise; it is possible that the farm bureau did not complain about this specific situation in 1990. however, the hypothesis does not logically follow from the premise as the premise only establishes a pattern and does not rule out individual exceptions.step 3: based on the information provided, the hypothesis cannot be logically inferred from the premise, as the premise does not entail the hypothesis. the premise describes a consistent pattern, but it does not provide sufficient details to determine whether or not the specific situation described in the hypothesis fits within that pattern."
669,Having one carrier would also reduce vehicle traffic in neighborhoods and allow familiarity with recipients.,Having one carrier would lower traffic amounts by 30%.,1,0,False,"step 1: in the premise, having one carrier is suggested as a potential solution to reduce vehicle traffic in neighborhoods and allow familiarity with recipients. this implies that the reduction of vehicle traffic is a result of having one carrier, but the premise does not provide an exact quantification of the reduction. the hypothesis proposes a specific decrease of 30%.step 2: while the premise implies a reduction in traffic, it does not directly entail the 30% figure mentioned in the hypothesis. the hypothesis goes beyond the information given in the premise.step 3: based on the logical analysis, the hypothesis cannot be logically inferred from the premise, as the premise does not provide enough information to support the specific quantification in the hypothesis."
723,"The value of Philly's program, observes former New Jersey Superior Court Judge Daniel R. Coburn, is that it separates the minnows from the sharks, then holds the minnows accountable and hence less likely to become sharks, let alone become the predatory Great Whites we must incarcerate.",The value of Philly's program is that it doesn't separate the minnows from the sharks.,0,0,True,"step 1: the premise describes judge coburn's observation that philly's program separates 'minnows' from 'sharks' and holds the minnows accountable, which makes them less likely to become 'predatory great whites' that need to be incarcerated. separating minnows from sharks is a common metaphor for identifying and dealing with potential threats. step 2: the hypothesis contradicts the premise, stating that philly's program does not separate minnows from sharks. step 3: based on the information provided, the hypothesis cannot be logically inferred from the premise as it directly contradicts it."
724,"But Japan was reluctant to sue for peace because the Allies were demanding unconditional surrender with no provision for maintaining the highly symbolic role of the emperor, still considered the embodiment of Japan's spirit and divine origins.",The Allies didn't care about peace.,1,0,False,"step 1: in the premise, japan was reluctant to sue for peace due to the allies' demand for unconditional surrender with no provision for maintaining the emperor's role. this indicates that the emperor's role was a significant concern for japan in the peace negotiations. the premise also does not suggest that the allies acted with disregard for peace.step 2: the hypothesis, stating that 'the allies didn't care about peace', directly contradicts the premise. there is no logical connection or justification for the hypothesis based on the information provided in the premise.step 3: based on the logical analysis and the contradictory nature of the hypothesis to the premise, the hypothesis cannot be inferred from the premise."
731,yeah i yeah my my very favorite one that the top of the tick for me is uh Excalibur i i loved that film um,"I really hate the movie Excalibur, because the script is so terrible.",0,0,True,"step 1: in the premise, the speaker expresses their strong liking for the movie excalibur. step 2: in the hypothesis, the speaker expresses an opposite opinion, stating that they hate the movie due to the terrible script. while it's common for people to change their opinions or have conflicting feelings towards things, the hypothesis directly contradicts the information given in the premise. step 3: based on the contradictory nature of the hypothesis compared to the premise, it cannot be logically inferred from the premise.step 4: it's important to note that this analysis is based on the given information in the premise and hypothesis alone. in real-life situations, there might be additional context or nuances that could alter the conclusion.step 5: given the contradiction between the premise and hypothesis, it is safe to assume that the hypothesis is not entailed by the premise."
773,WINZ's monitoring of its payment accuracy is discussed further in the case illustration on the following page.,Page number 34 contains WINZ's monitoring information also.,1,0,False,"step 1: the premise indicates that there is a discussion about winz's monitoring of its payment accuracy in the case illustration. this implies that there is relevant information regarding winz's monitoring in the case. step 2: the hypothesis suggests that page number 34 of the case contains this information as well. given that there is a discussion about winz's monitoring in the case, it's not unreasonable to assume that there could be additional information related to this topic on page 34. step 3: based on the information provided, it's possible, but not guaranteed, that the hypothesis is true. the hypothesis cannot be definitively proven or disproven from the given premise alone, as the premise does not limit the discussion to page 34. therefore, the hypothesis may be inferred with some uncertainty.step 4: to further evaluate the hypothesis, additional context or information would be required. for instance, if there is a clear statement that the monitoring information is presented only on page 34, then the hypothesis would be entailed by the premise. however, if there are other pages that also contain the monitoring information, then the hypothesis would not be entailed by the premise.therefore, based on the given information, the hypothesis cannot be definitively labeled as entailed or not entailed. the uncertainty arises from the possibility that there could be other pages with the monitoring information, and the premise does not limit this possibility.given this uncertainty, it's also important to note that the hypothesis not being entailed by the premise does not necessarily mean that it's false. it just means that the premise doesn't provide enough information to logically infer the hypothesis as true."
797,what i've been doing when i get invited someplace and bring something i make uh food kebabs You take little toothpicks and cut up uh pineapple and strawberry,I never bring any food when someone invites me to come over.,0,0,True,"step 1. the premise describes an action you take when invited somewhere and bringing food, specifically kebabs made with pineapple and strawberry. this implies that you have a habit of bringing food to social gatherings. step 2. the hypothesis states that you never bring any food when invited. this directly contradicts the premise as the premise clearly states that you do bring food. step 3. based on the logical analysis, the hypothesis cannot be inferred from the premise as they are contradictory statements."
804,"Over on the quiet, tree-shaded place de la Sorbonne, it's hard to imagine the police invading such a peaceful sanctuary one that for centuries guaranteed student immunity.",Students will find no sanctuary at the Place de la Sorbonne.  ,0,0,True,"step 1: the premise describes the place de la sorbonne as a peaceful sanctuary for students, with a long-standing tradition of providing immunity. step 2: the hypothesis suggests that students will find no sanctuary at the place de la sorbonne. this is a contradiction of the information in the premise. the hypothesis implies that the peaceful sanctuary is no longer a safe haven for students. step 3: based on the logical negation of the premise's positive statements, the hypothesis cannot be logically inferred from the premise. the hypothesis contradicts the premise and goes beyond the information provided."
843,when there was the ball that was sort of hit to Buckner to Buckner,The ball was hit away from Buckner.,0,0,True,"step 1: the premise describes an event where a ball was hit to buckner. this implies that buckner was the intended receiver of the ball, but it does not provide any information about the direction or force of the hit. step 2: the hypothesis suggests that the ball was hit 'away from' buckner. this could mean that the ball was hit to the side or behind buckner. step 3: it is not possible to logically infer the hypothesis from the premise, as the premise does not provide enough information about the direction of the hit. the hypothesis contradicts the premise if we assume a strict interpretation, but it is also possible that there are other contextual factors or nuances that could make the hypothesis true. for example, if buckner was not expecting the ball or was not properly positioned to receive it, then the ball could have been hit away from him inadvertently. without more context or specific details, it is not possible to definitively say whether the hypothesis is entailed by the premise or not.step 4: in the absence of sufficient information, it is reasonable to label this as no entailment."
870,Florentino Lico Subia's entire life history is inside his Chihuahuita home in South El Paso.,Frontino Lico Subia lived in that house for twenty years before going to college.,1,0,False,"step 1: the premise states that florentino lico subia's entire life history is inside his chihuahuita home in south el paso. it does not provide any explicit information about when he lived there or moved out. however, it is a common assumption that people usually reside at a location for a significant period before leaving for other reasons, such as going to college. step 2: the hypothesis suggests that florentino lico subia lived in the house for twenty years before going to college. this hypothesis is consistent with the information in the premise, as it does not contradict that florentino's entire life history is in the house. step 3: based on the assumption that people usually reside at a location for a significant period before leaving, and the absence of contradictory information, the hypothesis can be inferred from the premise. however, it is important to note that the premise does not provide enough information to definitively confirm the hypothesis."
875,The 16th-century polychrome rood beam spanning the nave is decorated with 12 prophetesses (on the chancel side) and scenes from the Passion.,The rood beam spanning the nave has a plain design with shades of red.,0,0,True,"step 1: in the premise, we have information about the 16th-century rood beam that spans the nave, which is decorated with 12 prophetesses on one side and scenes from the passion. this indicates a detailed and ornate design. common sense suggests that ornate decoration with figurative elements like prophetesses and passion scenes does not result in a plain design with shades of red. step 2: contradiction exists between the premise and hypothesis, as the premise indicates an ornate design with figures and scenes, while the hypothesis suggests a plain design with a single color. step 3: based on the logical contradiction and the lack of information or logical connection between the premise and hypothesis that would allow the hypothesis to be logically inferred, the hypothesis cannot be inferred from the premise."
889,OPM amended regulations that change the way agencies evaluate the members of the Senior Executive Service (SES).,OPM is famous for amending things without prior warning.,1,0,False,"step 1: in the premise, the context is that opm (office of personnel management) changed the regulations regarding the evaluation of ses (senior executive service) members. no specific information is provided about giving prior warning or lack thereof. step 2: the hypothesis suggests that opm is famous for amending things without prior warning. this is not directly related to the given premise and is an additional statement about opm's reputation. step 3: the hypothesis cannot be logically inferred from the premise as it introduces new information not present in the premise. the hypothesis might be true or false independently, but it does not follow logically from the provided premise.step 4: it is important to note that the premise only indicates that the regulations were amended, without specifying whether the change was made with or without prior warning. the hypothesis, on the other hand, makes a statement about opm's reputation related to giving prior warning, which is not mentioned or implied in the premise.step 5: based on the logical analysis, the hypothesis is not entailed by the premise, as it introduces new information not directly related to the given context."
894,"In Eastern Europe, exhumed bodies have been used as symbols by political parties, as anthropologist Katherine Verdery explains in her forthcoming book, The Political Lives of Dead Bodies in the Postsocialist Transformation . For instance, liberal reform parties have disinterred Communist leaders from their mausoleums while reburying pre-Communist nationalist heroes in elaborate sarcophagi.",Verdery researched political traditions in Eastern Europe in the 1890's.,1,0,False,"step 1: in the premise, katherine verdery is described as an anthropologist who has written a book about the political uses of dead bodies in eastern europe during the postsocialist transformation. no specific time frame for her research is mentioned. step 2: the hypothesis states that verdery conducted her research in the 1890's, which is a significant deviation from the facts provided in the premise. step 3: the hypothesis is not entailed by the premise, as there is no information in the premise that supports or suggests that verdery's research took place in the 1890's."
930,Fatigue dulled his thoughts.,His thoughts are rarely dulled.,1,0,False,"step 1: the premise indicates that 'fatigue dulled his thoughts'. this statement suggests that the person's mental abilities were impaired due to tiredness. this is a factual statement based on the information provided.step 2: the hypothesis, 'his thoughts are rarely dulled', contradicts the premise because it suggests that the person's thoughts are not often dulled, whereas the premise states that they were dulled due to fatigue in the given situation.step 3: based on the logical analysis, the hypothesis cannot be inferred from the premise as they contradict each other."
931,There are no substantive changes to the existing Section 406.,Section 406 needed some minor changes.,1,1,True,"step 1: in the premise, it is stated that there are no substantive changes to section 406. this means that the essential parts of the section have remained the same. the hypothesis suggests that only minor changes were required. step 2: a minor change implies an adjustment that is not fundamental or significant in nature. thus, if no substantive changes have been made, it is reasonable to conclude that only minor changes could have been necessary. step 3: since a minor change is a less extreme alteration than a substantive one, and the premise indicates that no substantive changes have occurred, the hypothesis can be inferred from the premise as a possible outcome."
933,He was probably the brother or eldest son of king Djoser.,He was probably the brother or eldest girl of king Djoser.,1,0,False,"step 1: in the premise, 'he was probably the brother or eldest son of king djoser' suggests a male relationship to the king. the hypothesis, 'he was probably the brother or eldest girl of king djoser', suggests a female relationship. step 2: the premise does not provide sufficient information to infer a female relationship between the person and king djoser. the hypothesis directly contradicts the premise by changing the gender. step 3: given the information provided in the premise and hypothesis, the hypothesis cannot be logically inferred from the premise."
954,Now the saddle.,Now add the sauce.,0,0,True,"step 1: in the premise, 'now the saddle' is describing a current state or situation where a saddle is present. this information does not directly provide any context or information related to the presence or absence of a sauce.step 2: the hypothesis, 'now add the sauce', suggests an action that involves adding an ingredient (sauce) to a dish or a situation. this action is unrelated to the presence of a saddle described in the premise. no logical connection or common sense reasoning can be made to infer the hypothesis from the premise.step 3: based on the lack of any logical or common sense connection between the premise and hypothesis, and the clear absence of any factual information in the premise that could support the hypothesis, the hypothesis cannot be inferred from the premise."
988,"In one recent memo, the pollster Frank Luntz  Rather than investigating Bill Clinton, which no one in America wants, we should be focusing our attention on a Government agency that has a negative impact on our day-to-day lives.",Bill clintons investigation made people more depressed,1,0,False,"step 1. in the premise, frank luntz is suggesting that the focus of investigation should be shifted from bill clinton to a government agency. he implies that people do not want the investigation into bill clinton. step 2. the hypothesis, 'bill clinton's investigation made people more depressed', does not follow logically from the premise. the premise does not provide any information about people's emotional state or mood related to the bill clinton investigation. step 3. furthermore, there is no factual basis or common-sense reasoning to support the hypothesis. the premise only mentions the desire of people not to focus on the bill clinton investigation. therefore, based on the provided information, the hypothesis is not entailed by the premise."
997,"He swung hard, cleaving a large gap in the villager's wooden shield.",The villager's shield was made out of oak.,1,0,False,"step 1: in the premise, it is stated that the villager's shield was damaged when the speaker swung hard, creating a large gap. the type of shield or its material is not mentioned. however, the action of 'cleaving a large gap' implies a significant force was used, and oak, being a robust and dense wood, is a common material for making strong shields. no contradictory information is provided in the premise.step 2: from the given information, it is not explicitly stated that the shield is made of oak. however, the hypothesis is not contradictory to the premise. the hypothesis 'the villager's shield was made out of oak' can be logically inferred if we consider the common sense knowledge that oak is a suitable material for making strong shields, and the implication from the premise that the shield needed to be strong to withstand the swing.step 3: based on the logical reasoning and common sense understanding, the hypothesis 'the villager's shield was made out of oak' is not directly entailed by the premise, but it is a plausible inference given the context and the common knowledge about materials used for shields."
1065,"It may be fun to say, as Frank put it in the Baffler , that William S. Burroughs' inspirational writings are boardroom favorites, his dark nihilistic burpings the happy homilies of the new corporate faith.",Burroughs wrote inspirational writings on the poster.,1,0,False,"step 1: the premise suggests that william s. burroughs' inspirational writings are popular in corporate environments. the hypothesis proposes that burroughs wrote inspirational content specifically for a poster.step 2: the hypothesis does not contradict the premise. both statements describe inspirational writings by burroughs, and the hypothesis does not negate the premise's assertion that these writings are used in corporate settings.step 3: creating inspirational posters is a common practice for spreading motivational messages, and it is not unreasonable for a famous author like burroughs to have written content for such posters. the premise does not provide evidence about the medium of burroughs' inspirational writings, so the hypothesis cannot be definitively proven or disproven based on the given information alone.step 4: based on the available information and common sense, the hypothesis is not entailed by the premise but remains plausible."
1070,"Batik fabric designs, silver and pewter ware, and silk brocaded songket cloth are popular items.","Batik fabric designs, silver and pewter ware, and silk brocaded songket cloth are the least purchased items.",0,0,True,"step 1: in the premise, it is stated that batik fabric designs, silver and pewter ware, and silk brocaded songket cloth are popular items. popularity implies that a significant number of people buy or prefer these items. step 2: the hypothesis states that these items are the least purchased. contradicting the premise, the hypothesis suggests that these items are not popular because they have the least number of sales. step 3: based on logical reasoning, the hypothesis cannot be inferred from the premise as the information provided in the premise is inconsistent with the hypothesis. the hypothesis goes against the common sense understanding of the situation presented in the premise. thus, there is no entailment."
1074,A man in a white lab coat is looking through a microscope.,There is a man looking through a scope,1,1,True,"step 1: in the premise, a man in a white lab coat is performing an action, which is specifically identified as 'looking through a microscope'. this indicates that the man is observing something under a magnified lens. step 2: the hypothesis 'there is a man looking through a scope' shares the same core concept as the premise, as 'scope' is a synonym for 'microscope'. both sentences describe a man observing something with an instrument for close examination. step 3: given the semantic similarity between the two sentences and the lack of contradictory information, the hypothesis can be logically inferred from the premise. "
1128,Your hotel or the Tourist Information Ceter will have information on the Studio Park guided tour of the NHK soundstages.,The area's tourism is based on guided tours of the NHK soundstages.,1,1,True,"step 1: in the premise, it is mentioned that a hotel or the tourist information center has information regarding the studio park guided tour of the nhk soundstages. this implies that there is a significant tourist attraction related to the nhk soundstages, as both a hotel and a tourist information center would typically provide information on popular tourist sites.step 2: the hypothesis states that 'the area's tourism is based on guided tours of the nhk soundstages'. this hypothesis is consistent with the information in the premise, as it also implies a significant focus on the nhk soundstages as a tourist attraction. the hypothesis can be considered a generalization of the information in the premise.step 3: based on the logical reasoning and the consistency of the hypothesis with the premise, the hypothesis can be inferred from the premise."
1159,and uh i think i think we'd be totally bankrupt if we didn't do something um,We've never had money issues.,0,0,True,"step 1: in the premise, the speaker indicates a concern about financial instability and the need to take action to prevent bankruptcy. this implies a current or potential lack of sufficient funds.step 2: the hypothesis, on the other hand, asserts that there have never been money issues.step 3: given the information in the premise, it is clear that the hypothesis contradicts it, as the premise suggests a history of financial difficulties. moreover, the hypothesis lacks logical entailment from the premise, as the premise does not provide any information about the past financial situation. common sense and logical reasoning suggest that the hypothesis cannot be inferred from the premise.step 4: based on the logical analysis, the hypothesis is not entailed by the premise, and it contradicts the information provided in the premise."
1160,"Surely that is, paradoxically, the most persuasive reason to slow down a bit at work and hang out more at home.",It was persuasive to work harder and not go home. ,0,0,True,"step 1: in the premise, the speaker is expressing a paradoxical idea, suggesting that the most persuasive reason to slow down at work and spend more time at home is, ironically, the very reason to do the opposite. this implies a situation where the speaker feels compelled to work hard and neglect home life.  step 2: the hypothesis contradicts the premise by suggesting the exact opposite. the speaker in the premise is persuaded to take things more slowly and spend more time at home, while the hypothesis suggests they were persuaded to work harder and not go home.  step 3: based on the logical analysis, the hypothesis cannot be inferred from the premise as they contradict each other."
1189,"More than anyone, they know it can be nearly impossible to do the former and avoid the latter in a one-sided contest where only one litigant has a lawyer.",They know that they can easily avoid the latter.,0,0,True,"step 1: in the premise, 'they' are acknowledging the difficulty of doing something (the former) and avoiding something else (the latter) in a one-sided legal contest. this implies a situation where 'they' are at a disadvantage due to not having a lawyer. step 2: the hypothesis asserts that 'they' can easily avoid the latter (the negative consequence of the one-sided contest). this directly contradicts the premise, which establishes that avoiding the latter is a challenge for 'they'. step 3: based on the logical contradiction between the premise and hypothesis, the hypothesis cannot be logically inferred from the premise."
1206,"From Gulliver's Travels to my scout troop's walk through the Heart Room at Philadelphia's Franklin Institute, grotesque shifts in scale have always been funny, particularly when a little thing is made big enough to walk into.",Nobody has ever thought that grotesque shifts in scale are funny.,0,0,True,"step 1: in the premise, the author describes how they have found humor in situations involving grotesque shifts in scale, using specific examples. this suggests a personal experience or perspective. step 2: the hypothesis directly contradicts the premise, as it asserts that nobody has ever found humor in such situations. this is a significant logical contradiction. step 3: based on the information provided, it is clear that the hypothesis cannot be logically inferred from the premise."
1207,yeah my truck is broken down,You are going to fix your truck.,1,0,False,"step 1: the premise states that 'my truck is broken down', which implies that the truck is not functioning correctly. step 2: the hypothesis suggests 'you are going to fix your truck'. however, the premise does not logically entail the hypothesis. the hypothesis introduces a new agent 'you', and there is no indication that the speaker intends to fix the truck. common sense suggests that the speaker may be reporting a problem with their truck, but it does not necessitate that they will fix it. step 3: based on the given information, the hypothesis cannot be logically inferred from the premise."
1209,Ios is hands-down the party island of the Aegean; its bars and clubs boom out the latest dance tunes 24 hours a day.,The bars and clubs make most of the money for the economy of Ios.,1,1,True,"step 1: in the premise, ios is described as the party island of the aegean with bars and clubs that never stop playing dance music. this implies a vibrant nightlife scene that attracts a large number of tourists. step 2: the hypothesis suggests that the bars and clubs are the primary source of income for ios's economy. given the information from the premise, it's a reasonable assumption that the nightlife industry contributes significantly to ios's economy, making the hypothesis plausible. step 3: the hypothesis can be inferred from the premise as the premise sets up the context for the hypothesis and the hypothesis is a logical extension of the information provided in the premise.step 4: it's important to note that while the hypothesis can be inferred from the premise, it doesn't necessarily mean that it's the only possible explanation or that it's the complete truth. other factors like agriculture, tourism, and manufacturing could also contribute to ios's economy. the hypothesis only suggests that the nightlife industry is a significant contributor based on the information given in the premise."
1210,Traditional examples of background music include music played at various social gatherings and music played in certain retail venues.,Traditional examples of background music include music played at same social gatherings and music played in certain retail venues.,0,1,False,"step 1: in the premise, 'traditional examples of background music' refers to music played at social gatherings and retail venues. the term 'traditional' implies a long-standing practice or custom. there are no logical contradictions or inconsistencies in the premise. step 2: the hypothesis is identical in meaning to the premise, with the same examples of social gatherings and retail venues being mentioned. the hypothesis is a logical consequence of the premise since it reaffirms the information provided. step 3: given the identical meaning and the lack of contradictory information, the hypothesis can be inferred from the premise."
1211,These new arrivals have created a series of shanty-towns around the perimeter of the city.,New arrivals move into the city itself.,0,0,True,"step 1: in the premise, 'new arrivals' are described as creating 'a series of shanty-towns around the perimeter of the city'. this implies that the new arrivals are located outside the city. step 2: the hypothesis, 'new arrivals move into the city itself', contradicts the information given in the premise. the hypothesis suggests that the new arrivals are moving into the city, which is the opposite of the premise stating that they are creating shanty-towns around the city perimeter. step 3: based on the logical reasoning and the contradiction between the premise and hypothesis, the hypothesis is not entailed by the premise."
1213,Two more men stood at her flanks.,Two men joined two others who were already flanking her.,1,1,True,"step 1: the premise describes the presence of two men on each side of a woman. this forms a clear scene with the men standing near her. no logical inconsistencies or contradictions are present in the premise. step 2: the hypothesis describes the addition of two men to a group of two other men who are already present. this is logically equivalent to the premise, as both describe the presence of two men on each side of the woman. step 3: since the hypothesis is a logical consequence of the premise, it can be inferred from the premise."
1214,The final rule contains information collections which are subject to review by the Office of Management and Budget under the Paperwork Reduction Act.,Information collections are not subject to review.,0,0,True,"step 1: in the premise, it is stated that 'information collections' are subject to review by the 'office of management and budget' under the 'paperwork reduction act'. this implies that there is a legal requirement for the review of these information collections. step 2: in contrast, the hypothesis suggests that 'information collections' are not subject to review. this directly contradicts the information presented in the premise. step 3: based on the given premise, the hypothesis is not entailed, as it contradicts the stated fact."
1215,She wears either revealing clothes or professional clothes (or perhaps both).,Sometimes her cleavage is showing and sometimes she's all covered up.,1,1,True,"step 1: the premise describes two possible options for what the woman wears - revealing or professional clothes. the use of 'either' implies that these are mutually exclusive options, but it's also possible that she wears both at different times. step 2: the hypothesis describes a scenario where sometimes a part of her body, specifically her cleavage, is visible, and other times she is completely covered. this description aligns with the premise as both revealing clothes (which may expose cleavage) and professional clothes (which may cover up) are mentioned in the premise. step 3: based on the logical alignment of the hypothesis with the premise and the common-sense understanding of the given information, the hypothesis can be inferred from the premise.step 4: it's important to note that the entailment does not imply that the woman's attire changes back and forth between revealing and professional in the same instance or within a short period. it only implies that at some point, she wears revealing clothes with cleavage showing, and at another point, she wears professional clothes that cover her up completely."
1216,"She landed beautifully, knees bent low and one leg out in front, swords ready.",She had her swords pointed at the people.,1,1,True,"step 1: the premise describes a scene where a person, referred to as 'she', lands with her knees bent and one leg out in front, and swords ready. this suggests that she is in a combat stance, preparing for a fight. step 2: the hypothesis proposes that 'she had her swords pointed at the people'. this inference is logically consistent with the premise, as pointing swords at people is a natural and expected action when preparing for combat or self-defense. step 3: based on the logical consistency of the hypothesis with the premise and the common sense understanding of combat situations, the hypothesis can be inferred from the premise."
1217,Congress and the administration have repeatedly expressed a commitment to more fully link resources to results.,The administration couldn't care less about linking resources to results.,0,0,True,"step 1: in the premise, 'congress and the administration have repeatedly expressed a commitment to more fully link resources to results,' the key information is that congress and the administration have made a public commitment to linking resources to results. this commitment implies an intention to allocate resources effectively and efficiently. common sense understanding and logical connections suggest that this commitment implies a concern for achieving results with the allocated resources.step 2: in the hypothesis, 'the administration couldn't care less about linking resources to results,' the statement contradicts the premise by suggesting a lack of concern or interest in linking resources to results. this contradiction is significant because the premise asserts a clear commitment to doing so.step 3: based on the logical inconsistency between the premise and hypothesis, it is clear that the hypothesis cannot be logically inferred from the premise. in fact, the hypothesis directly contradicts the premise.step 4: an important consideration when assessing the logical relationship between hypotheses and premises is the possibility of unstated assumptions or contextual factors that might affect the interpretation. however, in this case, there is no reason to believe that such factors exist that would make the hypothesis a reasonable inference from the premise.therefore, the hypothesis is not entailed by the premise."
1218,'And this disc...this disc has a message for Peter Greuze.,The disc has an important message for Peter.,1,1,True,"step 1: in the premise, it is stated that the disc has a message for peter greuze. 'message' implies some form of communication or information. 'important' in the hypothesis further emphasizes the significance or value of this information. no contradictory information is provided in the premise or hypothesis.step 2: the hypothesis 'the disc has an important message for peter' is a stronger statement than the premise, as it not only affirms the presence of a message but also emphasizes its importance. however, since the premise implies the existence of a message, and 'important' is a reasonable assumption for a message intended for a specific person like peter greuze, the hypothesis can be logically inferred from the premise.step 3: based on the logical reasoning and the lack of contradictory information, the hypothesis can be inferred from the premise."
1219,It almost cost your life.,Time traveling almost killed you.,1,1,True,"step 1: in the premise, 'it almost cost your life' implies a near-death experience or a situation where one's life was at risk. this statement is not limited to a specific context or event.step 2: the hypothesis 'time traveling almost killed you' proposes that an experience related to time traveling posed a significant risk to the person's life. while the hypothesis introduces a new concept (time traveling), it does not contradict or alter the information presented in the premise.step 3: since the hypothesis does not contradict the premise and is a plausible explanation for the near-death experience described in the premise, it can be considered a valid inference.step 4: in conclusion, given the lack of contradiction and the plausibility of the hypothesis in explaining the premise, the hypothesis 'time traveling almost killed you' can be logically inferred from the premise 'it almost cost your life'."
1220,For requests that involve work on programs or activities relating to the internal operations of the Congress-the,Internal operations may not be examined via request.,0,1,False,"step 1: in the premise, there is a restriction mentioned for requests related to the internal operations of the congress. the restriction implies that such operations are off-limits for examination. this is a factual statement based on the given context.step 2: the hypothesis states that 'internal operations may not be examined.' this is the same statement as in the premise. therefore, the hypothesis is logically equivalent to the premise.step 3: given the premise and hypothesis are logically equivalent, the hypothesis is entailed by the premise.step 4: based on the logical reasoning and the given information, the hypothesis is a direct entailment of the premise."
1221,"For example, as applied to the unrestricted aliens, such interpretations would preclude representation for permanent resident aliens who are evicted from their apartments or against whom divorce proceedings were commenced while the alien is legally out of the country for brief periods to attend a family emergency or funeral.",It is illegal for aliens to leave the country for brief periods.,0,0,True,"step 1: in the premise, it is mentioned that interpretations of certain laws could potentially prevent representation for permanent resident aliens under certain circumstances, such as eviction or divorce proceedings while they are out of the country for brief periods. this implies that there are specific laws or regulations that could potentially be relevant, and that the outcome of these proceedings could depend on the aliens' physical presence in the country. step 2: the hypothesis, 'it is illegal for aliens to leave the country for brief periods,' is a broad statement that could potentially encompass the specific situations mentioned in the premise. however, the premise itself does not explicitly state that it is illegal for aliens to leave the country for brief periods, but rather that their absence could potentially have legal consequences. step 3: while the hypothesis could potentially be a logical consequence of some interpretations of the laws mentioned in the premise, it is not a necessary or entailed consequence. the premise only indicates that certain situations could potentially arise if an alien is out of the country for brief periods, it does not explicitly state that it is illegal for them to do so. thus, the hypothesis cannot be logically inferred from the premise."
1222,"I understand,"" continued the Coroner deliberately, ""that you were sitting reading on the bench just outside the long window of the boudoir. ","""I understand that you were reading inside the boudoir."", continued the Coroner.",0,0,True,"step 1: the premise describes the location of the person as 'sitting reading on the bench just outside the long window of the boudoir'. this implies that the person is not inside the boudoir but rather near it. common sense and logical understanding of the term 'outside' also confirm this interpretation.step 2: the hypothesis changes the location of the person from 'outside' to 'inside' the boudoir. this contradicts the premise as it introduces new information that is not logically entailed.step 3: based on the logical analysis, the hypothesis 'i understand that you were reading inside the boudoir' cannot be inferred from the premise 'i understand, continued the coroner, that you were sitting reading on the bench just outside the long window of the boudoir'."
1223,"Modern free-form pieces can also be found, particularly in Chania where there are galleries stocked by avant-garde potters.",Chania is the largest town in the region.,1,0,False,"step 1: in the premise, 'modern free-form pieces can also be found, particularly in chania' indicates that chania is a location where modern, free-form pottery is available. the sentence does not provide any information about the size or population of chania. step 2: 'chania is the largest town in the region' is not logically entailed by the premise because the premise only establishes chania as a location with certain kinds of pottery. the hypothesis contradicts the premise if we assume that the size of a town or city is a requirement for being 'particularly' stocked with modern free-form pottery. step 3: based on the given information, the hypothesis cannot be logically inferred from the premise."
1224,"For this report, we provide an overview of the major theories about why people save and describe various factors associated with the decline in personal saving.",Nobody has any codified ideas as to why people might save.,0,0,True,"step 1: in the premise, it is clear that several theories are being discussed about why people save and the factors influencing the decline in personal saving. this implies that there are indeed ideas and theories about why people save. step 2: the hypothesis, 'nobody has any codified ideas as to why people might save,' contradicts the premise, as the premise states that there are major theories about this subject. step 3: based on the logical negation of the hypothesis compared to the premise, the hypothesis is not entailed by the premise."
1225,Interstate 235 (abbreviated I-235) in Oklahoma is also known as the Centennial Expressway or the I-235 Central Expressway.,Interstate 235 (abbreviated I-235) in Oklahoma is also known as the Centennial Expressway or the I-236 Central Expressway.,1,0,False,"step 1. the premise states that interstate 235 in oklahoma is known by the names centennial expressway and i-235 central expressway. step 2. the hypothesis proposes an alternative name for interstate 235 in oklahoma, which is centennial expressway but with the incorrect abbreviation i-236 instead of i-235. step 3. while both the premise and hypothesis share the common name 'centennial expressway', they differ in the abbreviations used. the premise is factually accurate, and there is no information provided that supports the hypothesis's incorrect abbreviation. therefore, the hypothesis is not logically entailed by the premise. step 4. the hypothesis is not entailed by the premise."
1226,Later he went to Thanjavur to study Sanskrit but could not finish it as he jumped into the fray of the Indian National Movement.,Later he went to Eguiner to study Sanskrit but could not finish it as he jumped into the fray of the Indian National Movement.,0,0,True,"step 1: the premise describes a person going to thanjavur to study sanskrit but getting distracted by joining the indian national movement. it does not provide any specific information about the location 'eguiner'. step 2: the hypothesis suggests a different location 'eguiner' for the person's study of sanskrit. however, the premise does not provide any information or logical connection that would entail the person going to eguiner instead of thanjavur. step 3: based on the given information, the hypothesis 'later he went to eguiner to study sanskrit but could not finish it as he jumped into the fray of the indian national movement' cannot be logically inferred from the premise 'later he went to thanjavur to study sanskrit but could not finish it as he jumped into the fray of the indian national movement'. the hypothesis introduces a new and unsupported fact."
1227,It is extremely dangerous to  Every trip to the store becomes a temptation.,"Even with every trip to the store, it never becomes a temptation.",0,0,True,"step 1: the premise states that going to the store is extremely dangerous and every trip becomes a temptation. this implies that the person finds it hard to resist buying things unnecessarily whenever they go to the store. step 2: the hypothesis, however, states that despite every trip to the store, it never becomes a temptation for the person. this directly contradicts the premise as the premise clearly states that every trip to the store is a temptation. step 3: based on the logical contradiction between the premise and hypothesis, it is clear that the hypothesis cannot be inferred from the premise."
1228,"The car was waiting, and I drove back.",The car left and I stayed.,0,0,True,"step 1: the premise states that the car was waiting, suggesting that it was there before i drove back. this does not necessarily imply that i was the one who was there with the car. the hypothesis suggests a different scenario where the car left and i stayed. step 2: the hypothesis contradicts the premise because if the car left, it would not have been waiting for me to drive back. step 3: based on the logical contradiction between the premise and the hypothesis, the hypothesis is not entailed by the premise."
1229,uniform and more tightly controlled mailstream.,The mailstream is very loosely regulated.,0,0,True,"step 1: the premise 'uniform and more tightly controlled mailstream' suggests a situation where the mailstream is managed in a consistent and regulated manner. this implies that there are rules or guidelines in place to maintain the uniformity and control.step 2: the hypothesis 'the mailstream is very loosely regulated' contradicts the premise. loose regulation implies a lack of rules or guidelines. therefore, the hypothesis cannot be logically inferred from the premise.step 3: based on the logical reasoning, the hypothesis 'the mailstream is very loosely regulated' cannot be inferred from the premise 'uniform and more tightly controlled mailstream'."
1230,The island also has Guangzhou's first modern luxury resort hotel.,The island does not have any hotels on it.,0,0,True,"step 1: in the premise, it is stated that the island has guangzhou's first modern luxury resort hotel. this implies that there is at least one hotel on the island. step 2: the hypothesis, however, asserts that there are no hotels on the island at all. this statement directly contradicts the information presented in the premise. step 3: based on the logical analysis and the given information, the hypothesis is not entailed by the premise and is, in fact, a contradiction."
1231,"The nave is a wonder of light and lofty proportions, enhanced by the luminous beige stone and the splendid ribbed vaulting.",There are no ribbed vaults to be found inside the nave. ,0,0,True,"step 1: in the premise, the term 'splendid ribbed vaulting' explicitly states the presence of ribbed vaults in the nave. the description of the nave as having 'lofty proportions' and being 'enhanced' by the ribbed vaulting further emphasizes this fact. step 2: the hypothesis directly contradicts the information provided in the premise. the absence of ribbed vaults is not logically inferable from the premise which states their presence. step 3: based on the logical analysis, the hypothesis cannot be inferred from the premise as it contradicts it."
1232,A man is jumping over a rock.,A woman is hiking.,0,0,True,"step 1: the premise describes an action performed by a man. it does not provide any information about the context or the location of the action. the hypothesis describes an activity that a woman can perform. step 2: the hypothesis does not logically follow from the premise because there is no connection between the man jumping over a rock and a woman hiking. the premise does not provide enough context or information to infer the presence or actions of other individuals. step 3: based on the lack of a logical connection between the premise and hypothesis, the hypothesis cannot be inferred from the premise."
1233,Some kids work 40 hours a week to make up the allowance gap.,"If the children don't work 40 hours, they'll starve.",1,0,False,"step 1. in the premise, it is stated that some kids work 40 hours a week to make up an allowance gap. this implies that there is a financial need that the kids' wages are addressing. however, the premise does not provide any information about the reason for the allowance gap or the kids' living conditions, nor does it suggest that they would starve without working 40 hours. step 2. the hypothesis, 'if the children don't work 40 hours, they'll starve,' is a significant jump in logic from the premise. it makes an unwarranted assumption about the children's situation and introduces a new concept (starvation) that is not mentioned or implied in the premise. step 3. based on the information given, the hypothesis cannot be logically inferred from the premise. the premise does not provide enough context or detail to support the hypothesis, and it makes an unjustified assumption about the children's circumstances."
1234,You are not aware of what has happened?,The man asked the other woman if she was feeling well.,0,0,True,"step 1: in the premise, there is no information about a man asking a woman anything. the premise only states that the speaker is not aware of what has happened. step 2: the hypothesis, 'the man asked the other woman if she was feeling well', is not logically entailed by the premise, as it contains new information not present in the premise. step 3: based on the lack of logical connection and the presence of new information, the hypothesis is not entailed by the premise."
1235,"To savour the full effect of the architect's skill, enter the courtyard through the gate which opens onto the Hippodrome.",The architect lacked any notable skill.,0,0,True,"step 1: in the premise, the architect's skill is described as 'full' or significant, suggesting a high level of proficiency. the instruction to enter the courtyard through a specific gate to savour this skill further emphasizes the importance of the architect's ability. step 2: the hypothesis directly contradicts the information presented in the premise, stating that the architect lacked any notable skill. it is illogical to suggest that one should enter a space designed by someone with no notable skill to savour their skill. step 3: based on the logical inconsistency between the premise and hypothesis, the hypothesis cannot be inferred from the premise."
1236,guess i bet you can't guess,You know already.,0,0,True,"step 1: the premise 'guess i bet you can't guess' implies that the speaker is making a guess or prediction about something that the listener may not know. this is a statement about the speaker's behavior and intent. the hypothesis 'you know already' suggests that the speaker believes the listener already knows the information, which is also a statement about knowledge.step 2: the hypothesis 'you know already' cannot be logically inferred from the premise 'guess i bet you can't guess.' the hypothesis contradicts the premise in the sense that it assumes the listener already knows what the speaker is guessing, while the premise assumes the listener does not. the hypothesis is not a necessary or logical consequence of the premise.step 3: based on the given information, the hypothesis cannot be logically inferred from the premise. the hypothesis contradicts the premise, and there is no logical connection between the two."
1237,The delicate walls of 13th-century stained glass (Paris's oldest) and harmonious proportions give it an ethereal quality in startling contrast to the ponderous palace surrounding it.,Its proportions are discordant and displeasing to the eye.,0,0,True,"step 1: in the premise, the delicate stained glass from paris's oldest 13th-century is described as having ethereal quality due to its contrast with the ponderous palace surrounding it. the harmony of its proportions is explicitly stated as contributing to this ethereal contrast. therefore, the given information suggests the proportions are harmonious.step 2: the hypothesis claims the proportions are discordant and displeasing to the eye, which directly contradicts the information provided in the premise.step 3: based on the logical negation of the hypothesis and the given premise, it is clear that the hypothesis cannot be inferred from the premise.step 4: the hypothesis is not entailed by the premise."
1238,This image offers a grossly distorted view of evolution.,Evolution is being distorted by people viewing this certain image.,1,1,True,"step 1: the premise asserts that the image in question presents a distorted view of evolution. this statement implies that the image does not accurately represent the scientific concept of evolution. no specific information is given about who or what is causing the distortion. step 2: the hypothesis suggests that people are responsible for the distortion of evolution presented in the image. this is a reasonable inference because the premise suggests that the distortion exists, and it is common sense that people are capable of altering information. step  3: based on the logical reasoning that the hypothesis is a reasonable inference from the premise, and the common-sense understanding that people have the ability to manipulate information, the hypothesis can be inferred from the premise.step 4: it is important to note that the hypothesis does not claim that the people in question have malicious intentions or that they are misrepresenting the facts deliberately. the hypothesis only states that people are responsible for the distortion. this is an essential distinction since the premise does not provide enough information to determine the intentions of the people involved.therefore, the hypothesis can be logically inferred from the premise, but it may not capture the full extent of the situation."
1239,"The wrestlers also enact crucifixions, sadomasochism, and prostitution.",The wrestlers act out weddings.,0,0,True,"step 1: the premise describes an activity where wrestlers enact various scenarios, including crucifixions, sadomasochism, and prostitution. these actions suggest violent, sexual, or adult themes. the term 'enact' implies that the wrestlers are intentionally performing these acts. step 2: the hypothesis suggests an entirely different scenario - that of weddings. weddings are celebratory events where two people formalize their relationship. there is no logical or apparent relationship between the premise and hypothesis. in fact, weddings are the opposite of the violent, sexual, or adult themes suggested in the premise. step 3: based on the lack of logical connection between the premise and hypothesis, and the significant differences in meaning, the hypothesis cannot be inferred from the premise."
1240,that's exactly right and i do,I do that quite often.,1,1,True,"step 1: both the premise and hypothesis are written in first person singular and refer to an action being performed quite often. no specific information about the nature of the action is provided in the premise, but the hypothesis suggests that the speaker is the one performing the action.step 2: given the absence of any specific information contradicting the hypothesis in the premise, and the fact that the hypothesis could apply to the same action mentioned in the premise, it can be reasonably inferred that the hypothesis is a valid statement about the speaker's actions.step 3: based on the logical consistency of the premise and hypothesis, and the lack of contradictory information, the hypothesis can be inferred from the premise."
1241,A man wearing a suit with a name tag stands reading in front of a microphone as a screen behind him displays a presentation.,a man sits on a sofa,0,0,True,"step 1: the premise describes a man in a suit, with a name tag, standing in front of a microphone and a presentation screen. this scenario suggests a public speaking event or a press conference. the man's attire and the presence of a microphone and presentation screen are common indicators of formal public speaking events.step 2: the hypothesis, 'a man sits on a sofa,' does not follow logically from the premise. the premise only tells us that the man is standing, not sitting. the presence of a microphone and a presentation screen does not necessarily mean there is a sofa in the room.step 3: based on the given information and logical reasoning, the hypothesis 'a man sits on a sofa' cannot be inferred from the premise."
1242,"A reality in that America's courts are open to everyone, and even the least powerful can seek justice, against the mightiest opponents.",American courts are only used by rich people.,0,0,True,"step 1: the premise asserts that america's courts are open to everyone, implying that access is not restricted based on wealth or power. this is a fundamental principle of the american legal system. step 2: the hypothesis contradicts the premise by stating that american courts are only used by rich people. this suggestion is a logical contradiction, as it goes against the core principle of equal access to the courts, regardless of wealth or power. step 3: based on logical reasoning and the contradiction between the premise and hypothesis, the hypothesis is not entailed by the premise."
1243,A More Constructive Test Approach Is Key to Better Weapon System Outcomes.,There is a better approach to weapon system accuracy.,1,1,True,"step 1: in the premise, 'a more constructive test approach is key to better weapon system outcomes', the key phrase is 'more constructive test approach'. this can be understood as a testing strategy that is more effective or productive in improving weapon system performance. the hypothesis 'there is a better approach to weapon system accuracy' suggests that there exists an alternative testing strategy or methodology that could potentially improve the accuracy of weapon systems. step 2: the hypothesis 'there is a better approach to weapon system accuracy' can be logically inferred from the premise because the premise states that a 'more constructive test approach' leads to 'better weapon system outcomes'. by implication, if there is a 'better approach', it would logically lead to improved weapon system accuracy. step 3: based on the logical connection between the premise and hypothesis, the hypothesis can be inferred from the premise."
1244,We can only overcome hate by refusing to give haters the attention they crave.,Haters are in fact pretending to hate.,0,1,False,"step 1: in the premise, it is stated that hate can only be overcome by refusing to give haters attention. this implies that the attention given to haters is what fuels their hatred. step 2: the hypothesis suggests that haters might be pretending to hate. this could be interpreted as an attempt to seek attention without actually hating. if this is the case, then the hypothesis aligns with the premise as both suggest that attention is a driving factor in hater's actions. step 3: based on the logical connection between the premise and hypothesis, it can be inferred that the hypothesis is a possible explanation for the premise, making it entailed. however, it's important to note that the hypothesis goes beyond the premise by suggesting a possible reason for the hater's behavior, but it doesn't contradict the premise.step 4: a potential counterargument could be that the hypothesis doesn't necessarily entail the premise as the premise applies to all haters, while the hypothesis only applies to some of them. however, since the premise allows for the possibility of some exceptions, this counterargument doesn't invalidate the original conclusion.step 5: in conclusion, while the hypothesis goes beyond the premise in explaining the reason for the hater's behavior, it doesn't contradict it and is a possible explanation for the premise. therefore, the hypothesis is entailed by the premise, but not a direct logical consequence."
1245,right i think it's seven here or seven point something,The temperature fluctuates rapidly over here.,1,0,False,"step 1: in the premise, the speaker is stating the current temperature as being around seven or seven point something, which does not provide any direct indication of temperature fluctuations. step 2. the hypothesis suggests that there are rapid temperature fluctuations over the location described. this is not directly inferred from the premise as the premise only speaks to the current temperature. step 3: based on the given information, the hypothesis cannot be logically inferred from the premise."
1246,oh i wish i could be doing that,I'm glad I don't have to do that ,0,0,True,"step 1: in the premise, the speaker is expressing a desire or longing for a situation. in the hypothesis, the speaker is expressing a contrasting emotion (gladness) in response to the same situation. this suggests a change in perspective or attitude towards the situation. however, it's important to note that this alone does not necessarily mean that the hypothesis can be logically inferred from the premise.step 2: the hypothesis cannot be directly logically inferred from the premise, as the premise does not provide enough information to determine why the speaker might be glad not to do that thing. the hypothesis introduces a new emotion, and there is no information in the premise that would logically lead to this conclusion.step 3: based on the given information, the hypothesis is not logically entailed by the premise."
1247,Nor are is the exact vote tallies in each of the Districts.,"Nor are the names of the candidates who stood, or is the exact vote tallies in each of the Districts.",1,1,True,"step 1: in the premise, 'nor are the exact vote tallies in each of the districts' implies that the vote counts are not known with certainty. the hypothesis, 'nor are the names of the candidates who stood, or is the exact vote tallies in each of the districts', suggests a lack of knowledge about both the candidates' names and the vote counts. these statements share the commonality of expressing uncertainty.step 2: given the premise, it is not a logical leap to assume that the names of the candidates are also unknown. the lack of knowledge about vote tallies does not necessarily exclude the possibility of knowing the candidates' names. however, since both statements express uncertainty, the hypothesis can be inferred from the premise as it is a more general statement encompassing the premise.step 3: based on the logical reasoning and the commonality of uncertainty expressed in both statements, the hypothesis can be inferred from the premise."
1248,"In 1996, the last year for which country statistics are available, 10,353 H-2A workers came from Mexico while only 4,231 came from the second leading country, Jamaica.","In the 1990's, around 10,000 H-2A workers came from Mexico.",1,1,True,"step 1: in the premise, we have information about the number of h-2a workers coming from mexico and jamaica in the year 1996. this information can be used to understand the context and the scale of h-2a worker migration from these countries. step 2: the hypothesis suggests that around 10,000 h-2a workers came from mexico in the 1990's. while the premise does not explicitly confirm this number, it does indicate that mexico was the leading country of origin for h-2a workers during this period. given that there was a significant difference in the number of workers coming from mexico compared to other countries, it is a reasonable assumption that mexico continued to be a major source of h-2a workers throughout the 1990's. step 3: based on the context and the logical connection between the premise and hypothesis, it is reasonable to infer that the hypothesis is entailed by the premise.step 1 and step 2 together provide the logical grounding for the inference. the premise does not explicitly state the number of h-2a workers coming from mexico in the 1990's, but the significant difference in the numbers of workers coming from mexico and jamaica in 1996 supports the hypothesis that around 10,000 h-2a workers came from mexico during this decade."
1249,He retreated with Sibley's force back east and fought through the rest of the war on the Southern side.,Part of the war was fought on the Southern side because they had a bigger chance of defeating their enemies from there.,1,1,True,"step 1: in the premise, it is stated that he retreated with sibley's force back east and fought through the rest of the war on the southern side. this indicates that the person mentioned in the premise engaged in military conflict on the southern side of a war.step 2: the hypothesis suggests that a part of the war was fought on the southern side because they had a bigger chance of defeating their enemies from there. this hypothesis is logically related to the premise, as the premise establishes that fighting on the southern side did indeed occur during the war.step 3: the hypothesis can be inferred from the premise based on the information provided, as the premise explicitly states that the war was fought on the southern side for this individual. the hypothesis goes a step further by explaining why that might have been the case (greater chance of victory), but it is not contradictory to the premise and can be reasonably inferred from it."
1250, Coronel Oliveri paused in the doorway of the stable to study the stallion with almost exuberant admiration mirrored on his dark and mobile features.,Oliveri stopped in the middle of the stable to admire the stallion.,0,1,False,"step 1: in the premise, coronel oliveri is described as pausing in the doorway of the stable to study the stallion with admiration. the key information here is that oliveri paused and admired the stallion. there are no contradictory facts or logical connections that alter this meaning. step 2: in the hypothesis, oliveri is also described as stopping to admire the stallion, which is the same action as in the premise. no logical contradiction is present between the two statements. step 3: based on the logical equivalence between the premise and hypothesis, and the lack of contradictory facts, the hypothesis can be inferred from the premise."
1252,"Mithridates VI, King of Pontus (on the Black Sea), resisted Roman occupation, temporarily occupied Pergamum, and ordered the massacre of all Romans.",Romans successfully occupied Pontus during the reign of Mithridates VI. ,0,0,True,"step 1: in the premise, mithridates vi is identified as the king of pontus who resisted roman occupation and temporarily occupied pergamum. he also ordered the massacre of all romans. this information suggests a period of conflict between pontus and rome. step 2: the hypothesis implies that at some point during the reign of mithridates vi, romans were able to successfully occupy pontus. this contradicts the information in the premise. step 3: based on the logical reasoning and the contradiction between the premise and hypothesis, the hypothesis is not entailed by the premise."
1253,Time Slave is a 1975 hybrid of science fiction by John Norman.,Time Slave is a 1975 hybrid of historical fiction and science fiction by John Norman.,1,1,True,"step 1: in the premise, it is stated that time slave is a science fiction novel written by john norman in 1975. no specific information is given about the content or setting of the novel in relation to historical facts. step 2: the hypothesis suggests that time slave is a hybrid of historical fiction and science fiction. this means that the novel combines elements of both genres. no contradiction to the premise is present. step 3: though neither the premise nor the hypothesis explicitly state that time slave contains elements of historical fiction, it is possible for a science fiction novel to include elements of historical fiction. the genres are not mutually exclusive, and their presence together does not contradict the given information. therefore, the hypothesis can be logically inferred from the premise, as the premise does not limit the genre of time slave to only science fiction."
1254,"That pile of twisted wreckage told me, in no uncertain terms: There is no Normal Again.","The wreckage showed me I could not relax, but always needed to be on guard.",1,0,False,"step 1: the premise is a metaphorical statement where the 'pile of twisted wreckage' is used as a figure of speech to convey a sense of despair or hopelessness, implying a significant change or loss. it does not provide any explicit information about the cause or nature of this change or loss.step 2: the hypothesis suggests that the wreckage made the speaker feel uneasy and the need to be constantly vigilant. this interpretation is compatible with the metaphorical meaning of the premise, as the feeling of being 'on guard' could be a result of the sense of despair or loss conveyed by the wreckage. however, the hypothesis is not logically entailed by the premise as it goes beyond the information provided in the premise and adds an additional detail.step 3: based on the information given, the hypothesis cannot be logically inferred from the premise, as it adds new information that is not directly stated or implied. however, it is a reasonable assumption that can be drawn based on the common sense understanding of the metaphorical meaning of the premise."
1255,"Thus, for example, if the volume in the first quintile were to double, total cost would increase by 29 percent.","Similarly, if the volume of the third quintile was cut in half, the cost would decrease by 25 percent. ",1,1,True,"step 1: in the premise, it is stated that if the volume in the first quintile doubles, the total cost increases by 29 percent. this suggests a direct relationship between volume and cost. in the hypothesis, it is suggested that if the volume in the third quintile is cut in half, the cost would decrease. step 2: the hypothesis can be logically inferred from the premise based on the following reasoning:1. the given information indicates that there is a relationship between volume and cost, with a 29% increase in cost when the volume in the first quintile doubles.2. the hypothesis proposes a similar relationship for a different volume quintile (the third quintile).3. the hypothesis states that if the volume is cut in half, the cost would decrease. this is consistent with the premise's relationship between volume and cost (an increase in volume leads to an increase in cost).4. if the relationship between volume and cost in the first quintile is extended to the third quintile, it would imply that a decrease in volume would lead to a decrease in cost.step 3: based on the logical reasoning and the consistency with the given information, the hypothesis can be inferred from the premise."
1256,It requires systems and practices and mindsets and commitments that may be foreign to many other non-profit providers of human services.,It is imperative that non-profit providers of human services use foreign practices and mindsets in order to work. ,1,0,False,"step 1: the premise suggests that effective human services provision may necessitate unfamiliar systems, practices, mindsets, and commitments for some non-profit organizations. this implies a need for adaptability and openness to change.step 2: the hypothesis asserts that non-profit providers must adopt foreign practices and mindsets to function effectively. while the hypothesis shares some similarities with the premise, it goes beyond it by specifying that these practices and mindsets must come from outside the current context.step 3: the hypothesis can be seen as a stronger or more extreme version of the premise, emphasizing the importance of unfamiliar approaches. however, the premise itself does not require the adoption of practices or mindsets from outside the current context.step 4: to clarify, the hypothesis suggests a stronger commitment to change and innovation than the premise. it advocates for actively seeking out new approaches, even if they come from outside the organization or sector.step 5: while the hypothesis can be reasonably inferred in certain contexts where the premise implies a need for radical change, it is not a logical necessity. the premise leaves open the possibility that unfamiliar approaches could come from within the organization or sector. therefore, the hypothesis is not strictly entailed by the premise.label: 0."
1257,"A notice of proposed rulemaking was published on May 16, 1996, following adoption by the FCC on April 25, 1996.",The FCC published the rule in 1996 but did not implement it.,0,0,True,"step 1: in the premise, a notice of proposed rulemaking was published on may 16, 1996, following the fcc's adoption of the rule on april 25, 1996. this sequence of events indicates that the fcc has taken the necessary procedural steps to publish the proposed rule. the publication of a notice of proposed rulemaking marks the beginning of the formal rulemaking process. step 2: the hypothesis states that 'the fcc published the rule in 1996 but did not implement it.' while it is true that publishing a notice of proposed rulemaking is a separate action from implementing a rule, the premise does not indicate that the rule was not implemented. the absence of information regarding implementation does not equate to non-implementation. step 3: based on the logical interpretation of the premise, it does not entail the hypothesis as there is no evidence in the premise that the rule was not implemented.in summary, the hypothesis goes beyond the given information in the premise."
1258,i know i've got one um i i did have two and the i found that um it just made me spend a little more so when i paid one of them off i got rid of it now i have two only have one,I will not get anymore after I pay this one off.,1,1,True,"step 1: in the premise, the speaker initially had two debts but paid off one and now only has one left. the hypothesis suggests that after paying off the current debt, the speaker will not get another debt.step 2: the hypothesis can be logically inferred from the premise, as the speaker's current situation (having only one debt) aligns with the desired state described in the hypothesis (having no debts). the premise shows the speaker's previous behavior of getting rid of a debt when they could afford to, which is consistent with the hypothesis.step 3: based on the logical reasoning and the absence of contradictory information in the premise, the hypothesis can be inferred from the premise."
1259,Two Seattle firefighters standing in front of their truck.,the firefighters are standing,1,1,True,"step 1: in the premise, 'two seattle firefighters' are described as being 'standing.' this indicates a current situation where the firefighters are not engaged in an active firefighting role, but rather, they are present and stationary. the hypothesis 'the firefighters are standing' exactly matches this description.step 2: the hypothesis is not only compatible with the premise but is also entailed by it. the premise, with its description of the firefighters' current state, implies or logically leads to the hypothesis.step 3: the hypothesis 'the firefighters are standing' is a straightforward and accurate inference from the premise 'two seattle firefighters standing in front of their truck'."
1260,studies or pooling of control group data might better identify predictors.,Studies or pooling do not help predictions.,0,0,True,"step 1: the premise suggests that studies or pooling of control group data might lead to a better identification of predictors, implying a potential benefit. step 2: the hypothesis states that studies or pooling do not help predictions, which contradicts the premise as it suggests a lack of benefit or even a detriment. step 3: however, the hypothesis does not necessarily contradict the premise if the premise is interpreted as allowing for the possibility that pooling of data might not always lead to better predictions. in fact, there are cases where pooling data might not be beneficial, such as when the differences between studies are too large or when the data are not homogeneous. thus, the hypothesis is not logically contradictory to the premise, but rather an alternative interpretation. step 4: to determine if the hypothesis can be logically inferred from the premise, we need to consider additional information or assumptions. for instance, if we assume that pooling data always leads to worse predictions, then the hypothesis can be logically inferred from the premise. however, without this assumption, the hypothesis cannot be logically inferred from the premise as they are logically distinct. step 5: based on the logical reasoning and the lack of sufficient information to determine a definitive answer, the hypothesis is not entailed by the premise."
1261,You'll see fascinating views of the rear of the Georgian houses of the New Town as well as the small cottages of Dean Village itself.,"If you travel a kilometer to the west, you'll be able to catch a glimpse of the back of the Georgian houses.",1,1,True,"step 1: in the premise, it is mentioned that you'll see the fascinating views of the rear of the georgian houses of the new town and the small cottages of dean village. this implies that there is a vantage point from which one can observe the backs of these buildings. no contradictory information is provided. step 2: the hypothesis suggests that if you travel a kilometer to the west, you'll be able to catch a glimpse of the backs of the georgian houses. this is a reasonable inference from the premise as it does not contradict any information provided and the vantage point mentioned in the premise could potentially be located a kilometer to the west. step 3: based on the logical reasoning and the lack of contradictory facts, the hypothesis can be inferred from the premise."
1262,"Bartolomé is right, Bayliss.","Bartolomé is lying, Bayliss.",0,0,True,"step 1: in the premise, bartolomé is asserting something that is true according to the given information. the hypothesis, however, suggests that bartolomé is lying, which is the opposite of the truth. step 2: a person lying would be asserting something that is false. hence, the hypothesis contradicts the premise. step 3: based on the logical principles that truth implies non-falsehood, and a lie is a false statement, it's clear that the hypothesis cannot be logically inferred from the premise.step 4: it's important to note that this analysis is based on the given information, which only states that bartolomé is right according to the premise. in real-world situations, there may be additional context or information that could change the conclusion. for instance, if it were known that bartolomé often lies, the hypothesis might be more plausible.step 5: therefore, the hypothesis cannot be logically inferred from the premise."
1263,The interim final rules contain information collections subject to review and approval by the Office of Management and Budget under the Paperwork Reduction Act.,The interim final rules are not subject to review. ,0,0,True,"step 1: the premise states that the interim final rules contain information collections that are subject to review and approval by the office of management and budget under the paperwork reduction act. this means that the rules have not yet been approved and are undergoing the review process.step 2: the hypothesis states that the interim final rules are not subject to review. this directly contradicts the information given in the premise. the review process is a necessary step before rules are considered final and enacted.step 3: based on the logical reasoning and the clear contradiction between the premise and hypothesis, the hypothesis is not entailed by the premise. the hypothesis states something that is not true according to the information provided in the premise."
1264,"There's a very good man in Paris makes a study of these cases but Mrs. Vandemeyer opposed the idea of publicity that might result from such a course.""",Mrs. Vandemeyer doesn't want the publicity from the vampires going public.,1,1,True,"step 1: in the premise, there's a mention of a 'very good man' who studies cases in paris, and mrs. vandemeyer's opposition to publicity. no specific information is given about the nature of these cases or why publicity is undesirable. there are no known facts contradicting the hypothesis.step 2: the hypothesis suggests a different interpretation for the cases and the reason for mrs. vandemeyer's opposition to publicity. it proposes that the cases involve vampires and that mrs. vandemeyer wants to keep this information hidden from the public. this interpretation is not explicitly stated in the premise but can be reasonably inferred based on the common association of vampires with secrecy and fear of public exposure.step 3: the hypothesis can be logically inferred from the premise if we consider the given information along with the common-sense understanding and contextual implications of the premise's details. the premise does not state the nature of the cases or why publicity is undesirable, leaving room for reasonable inferences based on available context. in this case, the hypothesis provides a plausible explanation for the premise's details that is consistent with the given information and common sense.step 4: although the premise doesn't explicitly mention vampires, the hypothesis makes a connection between the cases and vampires, which is a reasonable assumption based on common associations and contextual implications.therefore, the hypothesis 'mrs. vandemeyer doesn't want the publicity from the vampires going public' can be logically inferred from the premise based on the given information, common sense, and the reasonable assumptions we can make from the context of the premise."
1265,"The horses pull the carriage, holding people and a dog, through the rain.",Group of people traveling in the rain by horse-drawn carriage.,1,1,True,"step 1: in the premise, it is stated that horses pull a carriage through the rain, carrying people and a dog. this implies a scenario where people are traveling in a horse-drawn carriage during rain. this is a logical and common sense interpretation of the given information.step 2: the hypothesis 'group of people traveling in the rain by horse-drawn carriage' is identical to the key information identified in the premise, except for the inclusion of the 'group of people' phrase. this difference is insignificant as it doesn't change the meaning or implications of the premise.step 3: based on the logical analysis and the common-sense interpretation of the given information, the hypothesis can be inferred from the premise as they convey the same essential information."
1266,Being covered by health insurance.,No one has health insurance.,0,0,True,"step 1: in the premise, 'being covered by health insurance' refers to a state or condition where an individual has protection against financial losses due to illness or injury. this is a common concept in healthcare and insurance. step 2: the hypothesis, 'no one has health insurance', contradicts the premise. the premise implies the existence of individuals who have health insurance, while the hypothesis states that no one does. step 3: based on the logical negation of the hypothesis, it is clear that the hypothesis cannot be inferred from the premise.step 4: it is important to note that while the hypothesis contradicts the premise, the premise itself does not imply the hypothesis. the premise only provides information about a specific condition (having health insurance), and it does not make a general statement about the absence of health insurance for all individuals.therefore, the hypothesis is not entailed by the premise."
1267,They also lost in the first round to Middlesbrough.,"They also competed in the FA Cup, but lost in the first round to Middlesbrough.",1,1,True,"step 1: in the premise, it is stated that 'they also lost in the first round to middlesbrough'. this implies that 'they' are a team that participated in a competition, and they lost in the initial round of that competition against middlesbrough. no contradictory facts are provided in the premise.step 2: the hypothesis states that 'they also competed in the fa cup, but lost in the first round to middlesbrough'. this hypothesis is logically consistent with the premise, as it does not contradict any information given in the premise. moreover, it adds the detail that the competition in question is the fa cup, which is a common and expected context for a team losing in the first round to another team.step 3: based on the logical consistency, the absence of contradictory facts, and the common-sense understanding of the context, the hypothesis can be inferred from the premise.step 4: the 'label' value should be '1' to represent entailment, as the hypothesis is a logical consequence of the premise."
1268,Most shops closed at 6 p.m. weekdays and on Saturday were not open or were open only until noon.,Shops might be open during noon because it is early.,1,0,False,"step 1: in the premise, it is stated that most shops close early in the evening on weekdays (at 6 p.m.) and on saturdays are either not open or only open until noon. this information implies that the shops generally have limited operating hours. step 2: the hypothesis states that 'shops might be open during noon because it is early.' while it is true that noon is considered early in the day, it does not necessarily mean that all or most shops are open at that time. the hypothesis contradicts the information given in the premise, as the premise states that most shops are closed or have limited hours during noon on saturdays. step 3: based on the logical reasoning and the contradiction between the premise and hypothesis, the hypothesis cannot be inferred from the premise."
1269,"'Hello, Mr. Franklin,' he greeted me cheerfully.",He greeted me and opened the door.,1,1,True,"step 1: the premise describes a person greeting the speaker. this action involves addressing the speaker and expressing a friendly or pleasant demeanor. no specific location is mentioned in the premise, but there's no indication that the door was not opened as well.step 2: the hypothesis combines the action in the premise with an additional action - opening the door. opening the door is an independent action that does not contradict the premise and may very well have occurred along with the greeting.step 3: based on the logical reasoning, lack of contradiction, and the fact that both actions are possible to occur in sequence, the hypothesis can be inferred from the premise."
1270,uh-huh you know i've heard we have a couple of friends that goes to Washington quite often and that must be the thing they really hadn't either they went to the Memorial you know because when they go it's on business it's not really just to getting to sight see,We have friends that go to Washington often for vacation.,1,1,True,"step 1: in the premise, it mentions that 'we have a couple of friends that goes to washington quite often.' the key information here is that the friends visit washington frequently. step 2: the hypothesis states 'we have friends that go to washington often for vacation.' this hypothesis can be inferred from the premise because the given reason for their frequent visits, 'it's not really just to getting to sight see,' can be interpreted as them going for vacation. that is, they go for leisurely purposes, which is a common reason for taking vacations. step 3: based on the logical reasoning, the hypothesis can be inferred from the premise."
1272,"For example, it formats printouts for two or three columns a page, thus saving even more paper.",It only formats printouts for one column a page.,0,0,True,"step 1: in the premise, it states that the example formats printouts for two or three columns a page, saving paper. this implies that the formatting process involves arranging text into multiple columns. step 2: the hypothesis, however, suggests that the example formats printouts for only one column a page. this is a direct contradiction to the information provided in the premise. step 3: based on the logical negation of the information in the premise and the obvious contradiction between the premise and hypothesis, the hypothesis is not entailed by the premise."
1273,It discarded much of its faith in the possibility of a scientific liberalism.,"It supported American entry into World War One, but discarded much of its faith in the possibility of a scientific liberalism.",1,0,False,"step 1: in the premise, 'it' refers to a subject that has discarded much of its faith in the possibility of a scientific liberalism. this implies a critical stance towards this ideology. the hypothesis also mentions 'it' and states that this subject supported american entry into world war one. thus, the 'it' in both sentences refers to the same subject.step 2: supporting american entry into world war one does not logically entail the loss of faith in scientific liberalism. the two statements are independent. however, there could be contextual or historical reasons why the loss of faith in scientific liberalism might follow from this action. for instance, the war could have shown the limitations of scientific rationality in political and social affairs, leading some people to question their faith in this ideology.step 3: although the hypothesis is not logically entailed by the premise, it is not contradictory either. the loss of faith in scientific liberalism does not prevent someone from supporting the entry into the war. therefore, the hypothesis could still be true in some contexts, even if it is not logically implied by the premise.step 4: without additional context or information, it is not possible to determine definitively whether the hypothesis is true or false based on the premise alone. the premise only establishes that the subject lost faith in scientific liberalism, but it does not provide enough information to infer whether this loss of faith occurred before or after the support for american entry into world war one. thus, the hypothesis is neither entailed nor contradictory with the premise, but its truth depends on the specific historical context of the subject in question."
1274,"Anse was on his feet, had taken two steps in the direction of the soldier.","After the horrific news, Anse had gotten to his feet.",1,0,False,"step 1: in the premise, anse is described as being on his feet and taking two steps towards a soldier. this information does not provide any context about the reason for anse getting up. step 2: the hypothesis suggests that anse got up 'after the horrific news.' however, the premise does not mention any such news or event. step 3: since the hypothesis does not follow logically from the premise, and there is no common sense reasoning or factual consistency to suggest it, the hypothesis cannot be inferred from the premise.step 4: it is important to note that making assumptions about unprovided context or information can lead to incorrect inferences. in this case, the hypothesis seems plausible based on general knowledge or common sense, but without the necessary context, it cannot be logically inferred from the given premise."
1275,okay just in case,"Okay, never mind what you ate for breakfast.",0,0,True,"step 1: both the premise and hypothesis are statements expressing a speaker's intention towards a conversation. neither sentence provides any specific information about the content of the conversation or what was eaten for breakfast. the premise does not affect the hypothesis in any logical or factual way. step 2: there is no logical relationship or contradiction between the premise and hypothesis. the hypothesis does not follow or can be inferred from the premise. step 3: based on the information and logical analysis, the hypothesis is not entailed by the premise."
1276,"Phillip Calvert 1626 – 1682, also known as Philip Calvert, was the fifth Governor of Maryland during a brief period in 1661.","Phillip Calvert (1626 – 1682), also known as Philip Calvert, was the fifth Governor of Maryland during a brief period in 1660 or 1661.",1,1,True,"step 1: both the premise and hypothesis describe the same person, phillip calvert, and the same position, the fifth governor of maryland. the only difference is the year of his governorship in the hypothesis. step 2: the hypothesis can be logically inferred from the premise because the year in the hypothesis, 1660 or 1661, falls within the range of the premise's statement of 'a brief period in 1661'. step 3: based on the logical reasoning and the fact that the hypothesis is a more specific instance of the premise, the hypothesis is entailed by the premise."
1277,yeah i think that the NFL is going to use that league as uh uh kind of like as a minor league to recruit players,I don't think the NFL will recruit anyone from that league.,0,0,True,"step 1: in the premise, it is suggested that the nfl might use a certain league as a minor league for recruiting players. this implies that the nfl intends to draw talent from this league. step 2: the hypothesis states that the nfl will not recruit anyone from this league. this is a clear contradiction of the premise, as the premise indicates an intention to recruit, while the hypothesis asserts that no recruitment will occur. step 3: based on the logical contradiction between the premise and hypothesis, the hypothesis cannot be logically inferred from the premise.step 4: it is important to note that while the hypothesis is not logically entailed by the premise, it does not necessarily mean that the hypothesis is false. the truth or falsity of the hypothesis would depend on the actual intentions and actions of the nfl. the logical analysis only addresses the relationship between the two sentences provided in the question."
1278,"Japan's biggest daily newspaper, Asahi Shimbun, published an interview Sunday with Woody Allen, who, asked to sum up the 20 th century in a single word, replied, Disappointing.","Billy Joel described the 20th century as ""outlandish"" in a recent interview with Japan's leading newspaper. ",0,0,True,"step 1: the premise describes an interview with woody allen, in which he expressed disappointment as his summary of the 20th century. this is a subjective opinion, and there's no indication that allen's opinion is the only valid or representative one. step 2: the hypothesis proposes a different summary of the 20th century, 'outlandish,' attributed to billy joel in an interview with a different newspaper. there's no logical connection or indications that allen and joel's opinions are related or similar. step 3: based on the information provided, there's no clear or logical entailment from the premise to the hypothesis. although both involve opinions about the 20th century, they are distinct and unrelated. therefore, the hypothesis cannot be logically inferred from the premise."
1279,"Nearby is the base of the Altar of Zeus, built to commemorate the defeat of the Gauls by the Romans in 190 b.c.",The Altar of Zeus is abstract art brought over by the pilgrims.,0,0,True,"step 1: in the premise, we have historical information about the altar of zeus, its location, and its origin. the altar is described as a physical structure built to commemorate a historical event. step 2: the hypothesis suggests that the altar of zeus is abstract art. this is a significant departure from the information given in the premise, as abstract art is not a physical structure built for commemoration, but rather an artistic expression. step 3: based on the given information, the hypothesis cannot be logically inferred from the premise. the premise describes the altar of zeus as a physical structure built for commemoration, while the hypothesis suggests it is abstract art, which is a fundamentally different concept."
1280,They received the Rhythm Foundation 's prestigious Pioneer Award in 1992 and were inducted into the Vocal Group Hall of Fame in 1999.,They received the Rhythm and Blues Foundation's prestigious Pioneer Award in 1992 and were inducted into the Vocal Group Hall of Fame in 1999.,1,1,True,"step 1: the premise provides factual information about a group receiving the rhythm foundation's pioneer award in 1992 and being inducted into the vocal group hall of fame in 1999. rhythm foundation and rhythm and blues foundation are similar organizations, both focused on music, but they are separate entities. there is no contradiction in the premise or hypothesis. step 2: the hypothesis is identical to the premise, with no addition or omission of information. the hypothesis can be logically inferred from the premise because the premise itself already includes all the information in the hypothesis. step 3: based on the logical equivalence of the premise and hypothesis, the hypothesis is entailed by the premise."
1281,"As long as sufficient skills are retained inhouse to meet the smart buyer approach discussed above, there does not appear to be any greater risk from contracting out a broader range of design review functions, including such services as construction document discipline reviews and code compliance checks, so long as such functions are widely available from a competitive commercial marketplace.",The smart buyer approach needs specific skills such as negotiation.,1,0,False,"step 1: the premise suggests that there is no greater risk in contracting out a broader range of design review functions, including construction document discipline reviews and code compliance checks, if these functions are widely available from a competitive commercial marketplace and sufficient skills are retained in-house to meet the smart buyer approach. the smart buyer approach refers to a procurement strategy where the buyer has a high level of expertise and knowledge about the requirements and expectations of the project.step 2: the hypothesis focuses on the need for specific skills, particularly negotiation, in the smart buyer approach. while the premise does not directly mention the need for negotiation skills, it does not contradict the hypothesis either. the presence of a competitive commercial marketplace implies that buyers can negotiate terms and prices with service providers. however, the premise does not state that negotiation skills are a necessary condition for the smart buyer approach.step 3: based on the given information, the hypothesis cannot be logically inferred from the premise. the hypothesis introduces an additional requirement for the smart buyer approach, which is not explicitly stated in the premise. therefore, the hypothesis goes beyond what is entailed by the premise."
1282,"These proposals reflected the purported desire of mailers for smaller and, implicitly, more frequent rate increases.",These proposals showed how mailers want larger rate increases.,0,0,True,"step 1: in the premise, the term 'smaller and more frequent rate increases' implies that the total increase in rates desired by mailers is less than what they might have initially wanted. the premise does not provide explicit information about the size of the rate increases mailers actually want. step 2: the hypothesis 'these proposals showed how mailers want larger rate increases' contradicts the information in the premise by suggesting that mailers' desired rate increases are larger, rather than smaller and more frequent. step 3: based on the given information and the logical negation of the hypothesis, it can be concluded that the hypothesis is not entailed by the premise."
1283,Nationalists in the new United Malays National Organization (UMNO) resented this  foreign  intrusion imposed by 19th-century economic development.,The intrusion disturbed the nationalists and was totally unexpected.,1,1,True,"step 1: in the premise, the nationalists are shown to have resented the economic development intrusion. this implies that they considered the intrusion as unwelcome and detrimental to their interests. step 2: the hypothesis suggests that the intrusion was unexpected. this is consistent with the premise's implication that the intrusion was not welcomed, as unexpected events are often unwelcome. step 3: based on the logical relationship between the premise and hypothesis and common sense understanding, the hypothesis can be inferred from the premise.step 4: the premise does not explicitly state that the intrusion was unexpected, but the implication of the premise is that the nationalists found it unwelcome and disturbing, which is consistent with the hypothesis's suggestion of unexpectedness.therefore, the hypothesis can be reasonably inferred from the premise."
1284,It is free - to - play.,"It is free-to-play, but offers the option to buy additional in-game gear, attempts and resources.",1,1,True,"step 1: in the premise, 'it is free-to-play' indicates that the game can be accessed and played without any initial monetary investment. this is a common characteristic of free-to-play games. step 2: the hypothesis 'it is free-to-play, but offers the option to buy additional in-game gear, attempts and resources' does not contradict the premise as it maintains the free-to-play aspect. in fact, having optional in-game purchases is a common feature in many free-to-play games. step 3: based on the logical reasoning and lack of contradiction, the hypothesis can be inferred from the premise. this is because the hypothesis does not alter the free-to-play nature of the game but adds an additional feature, which is the presence of optional in-game purchases."
1285,A runner in a yellow shirt is running a race.,A person is running.,1,1,True,"step 1: in the premise, a runner in a yellow shirt is identified as participating in a race. a runner is a type of person who engages in physical activity. the term 'person' is a more general term that includes runners. therefore, the premise implies that a person is running. step 2: the hypothesis is consistent with the premise as it also states that a person is running. step 3: based on the logical relationship between the terms 'runner' and 'person', and the fact that the premise implies the existence of a runner, the hypothesis can be inferred from the premise."
1286,but you know it's pretty hard to try let's say the man down the street that's living on Social Security or somebody that's on a limited income to be tried by a jury of his peers if most of the people like the juries that i've served on are businessmen,There's nothing wrong with trying people on limited income by a jury of his peers.,0,0,True,"step 1: the premise expresses a concern that it may be difficult for individuals with limited income to receive a fair trial by a jury of their peers, given that most jurors are businessmen. this implies a potential imbalance of perspectives and experiences. step 2: the hypothesis asserts that there is nothing wrong with trying people with limited income by a jury of their peers. this statement is not directly in contradiction with the premise, as the premise does not deny that such trials can be fair. however, it does not logically follow from the premise either, as the premise only expresses a concern, not a definitive statement about the unfairness of such trials. step 3: the hypothesis cannot be logically inferred from the premise, as they address different aspects of the situation. the premise expresses a concern, while the hypothesis makes a positive assertion. without further information or logical connections, it is not possible to infer the hypothesis from the premise."
1289,"In July 1936, most of the army, led by General Francisco Franco with the support of the monarchists, conservatives, the clergy, and the right-wing Falange rose against the government in Madrid.",General Franco did even have the support of the army when he rose against the government.,0,1,False,"step 1: in the premise, it is stated that 'most of the army' supported general franco during the uprising against the government in july 1936. this indicates a significant number of soldiers were on franco's side. step 2: the hypothesis 'general franco had the support of the army when he rose against the government' is an explicit statement of the fact mentioned in the premise. it is a logical consequence of the information provided. step 3: based on the logical consistency between the premise and hypothesis, and the lack of contradictory information, the hypothesis can be inferred from the premise."
1290,"contracting method can also affect who is involved at each phase (A/E,",contracting method is irrelevant to involvement in a given phase.,0,0,True,"step 1: the premise suggests that the contracting method can influence who is involved in various phases of a project. this implies a causal relationship between the contracting method and the involvement of different entities.step 2: the hypothesis, however, asserts that the contracting method is completely irrelevant to involvement in a given phase. this contradicts the premise, as the premise explicitly states that the contracting method can impact who is involved.step 3: based on the information provided, the hypothesis cannot be logically inferred from the premise. the premise and hypothesis are incompatible, with the premise suggesting a causal relationship while the hypothesis asserts irrelevance."
1291,"As the name suggests, the genre is a fusion of Celtic rock.","As the name suggests, the genre is a fusion of heavy metal and Celtic rock.",1,1,True,"step 1: in the premise, it is stated that the genre is a fusion of celtic rock. in this context, 'celtic rock' refers to a genre that combines traditional celtic music with rock music. step 2: the hypothesis suggests an additional element to the fusion, by adding heavy metal to celtic rock. the term 'heavy metal' refers to a genre characterized by loud and distorted electric guitars, powerful drums, and often aggressive or radical lyrics. step 3: the hypothesis does not contradict the premise, as it is an extension of the fusion concept. it is not uncommon for genres to have multiple influences, and heavy metal is a valid influence for celtic rock. thus, the hypothesis can be inferred from the premise as a more specific description of the same genre.step 4: it is also important to note that the hypothesis does not alter the fundamental meaning of the premise, which is that the genre is a fusion of two or more musical genres. instead, it provides a more detailed description of one of the genres involved.therefore, the hypothesis is a logical consequence of the premise, and it is not a contradiction.step 5: based on the logical reasoning, the lack of contradiction, and the common-sense understanding of music genres and their potential fusion, the hypothesis can be inferred from the premise.step 6: in summary, the hypothesis 'as the name suggests, the genre is a fusion of heavy metal and celtic rock' can be logically inferred from the premise 'as the name suggests, the genre is a fusion of celtic rock', as it provides a more detailed description of one of the genres involved in the fusion."
1292,Hamon said directors of Kentucky's four Legal Aid programs still are reviewing the cuts.,Hamon said that no one is reviewing the cuts.,0,0,True,"step 1: the premise states that hamon reported that directors of kentucky's four legal aid programs are still reviewing the cuts. this implies that there is an ongoing process of reviewing the cuts. step 2: the hypothesis states that hamon said that no one is reviewing the cuts. this contradicts the information in the premise, as it suggests that no one is involved in the reviewing process. step 3: based on the logical negation of the premise's information, the hypothesis cannot be inferred from the premise as it contradicts it."
1293,they might as well steal it then they don't have to pay taxes on it,Paying taxes is an important part of taking possession of something to me. ,1,0,False,"step 1: the premise expresses a viewpoint that it's more advantageous to steal something instead of paying taxes on it. this implies a dislike or unwillingness to pay taxes. step 2: the hypothesis suggests that paying taxes is an essential part of acquiring something. this statement is not logically contradictory with the premise, but it is in contrast. step 3: despite the difference in perspectives, neither the premise nor the hypothesis definitively rules out the other. the premise does not prevent the hypothesis from being true, and the hypothesis does not invalidate the premise. there is no logical entailment or contradiction between the two sentences.step 4: it's important to note that the premise and hypothesis pertain to different perspectives on the concept of taxes. the premise describes a motivation for avoiding taxes, while the hypothesis emphasizes the importance of paying taxes. these statements do not necessarily conflict with each other as they focus on different aspects of the topic, and one person could hold both beliefs in different contexts.therefore, based on the logical reasoning and the distinction between the premise and hypothesis, the hypothesis is not entailed by the premise, and they are not logically related."
1294,and so usually we go to we don't go to the tourist ones we go to the ones that they tell us to go to you know,We don't like the tourist ones. ,1,1,True,"step 1: in the premise, the speaker mentions that they don't go to tourist attractions 'usually' and instead go to the ones they are told to go to. this suggests a preference or aversion towards tourist attractions. step 2: the hypothesis states that 'we don't like the tourist ones.' it aligns with the information in the premise, as not going to a place because it's a tourist attraction implies disliking it. both statements express a lack of fondness for tourist attractions. step 3: based on the logical relationship between the premise and hypothesis, common sense understanding, and the lack of contradictory information, the hypothesis can be inferred from the premise."
1295,Seven men wearing bright orange reflective vests are looking inside the door of a red train.,A group of men wearing business suits are ready to board the train.,0,0,True,"step 1: the premise describes a scene where seven men in bright orange reflective vests are looking inside a red train. this information does not inherently provide any details about the purpose or attire of the men before or after they are looking at the train. common sense and logical reasoning do not dictate an entailment between the given premise and the hypothesis.step 2: the hypothesis, 'a group of men wearing business suits are ready to board the train', is not logically inferred from the premise as there is no direct connection between the men in orange vests and the men in business suits.step 3: based on the given information and logical reasoning, the hypothesis is not entailed by the premise."
1296,"We also coordinated with other GAO representatives to identify states that had taken actions to reduce improper payments in federal programs in which program management is a state responsibility, such as the Food Stamp program.",We found out that eleven states had successfully reduced improper payments in federal programs.,1,1,True,"step 1: in the premise, it is mentioned that gao identified states that had taken actions to reduce improper payments in federal programs where program management is a state responsibility. this implies that there are states that have been successful in this regard. step 2: the hypothesis states that eleven states had successfully reduced improper payments. this number can be considered a reasonable estimation based on the information provided in the premise. the hypothesis does not contradict the premise and is consistent with the mentioned scenario. step 3: the hypothesis can be inferred from the premise as it is a logical consequence of the identified actions of the states mentioned in the premise.step 4: furthermore, it is a common sense assumption that if states have taken actions to reduce improper payments, it is likely that some of these efforts have been successful. therefore, the number eleven being mentioned in the hypothesis is a reasonable estimation.therefore, based on the logical reasoning, common sense, and consistency with the given premise, the hypothesis is a reasonable inference."
1297,Two women are riding motorized bicycles through a street.,Women are riding motorized bikes.,1,1,True,"step 1: in the premise, it is stated that 'two women are riding motorized bicycles through a street'. this means that two women are using motorized bicycles for transportation on a street. motorized bicycles are a type of vehicle, and women are the riders. step 2: the hypothesis 'women are riding motorized bikes' is exactly the same as the information given in the premise. therefore, the hypothesis can be logically inferred from the premise. step 3: based on the logical equivalence between the premise and hypothesis, the hypothesis is entailed by the premise."
1298,they um tend to spend,They don't spend anything,0,0,True,"step 1. the premise 'they tend to spend' is an indefinite statement indicating a general pattern or habit of spending. it does not provide specific information about the amount or frequency of spending. step 2. the hypothesis 'they don't spend anything' is a clear contradiction of the general spending pattern in the premise. step 3. the hypothesis cannot be logically inferred from the premise as the premise allows for spending, while the hypothesis denies any spending."
1300,"Why, Cynthia, you are late to-day. ",Cynthia was right on time. ,0,0,True,"step 1: in the premise, 'why, cynthia, you are late to-day' is a rhetorical question implying that cynthia is indeed late. it does not provide any specific information about the reason for her lateness or any context that could indicate she was actually on time. the hypothesis, 'cynthia was right on time', directly contradicts the premise. step 2: given that the hypothesis contradicts the premise, it cannot be logically inferred from the premise. step 3: based on the logical negation of the premise by the hypothesis, and the lack of any supporting information or context in the premise, the hypothesis is not entailed by the premise."
1301,Or just a philosophy of any weapon to hand?,They go with any weapon.,1,1,True,"step 1: the premise is a question suggesting that someone might be using any weapon at their disposal. this implies a flexibility or adaptability in choosing a weapon. step 2: the hypothesis, 'they go with any weapon,' can be inferred from the premise as it also implies a flexibility or adaptability in choosing a weapon, aligning with the meaning of the premise. step 3: the hypothesis can be logically inferred from the premise as the meanings of both sentences convey a similar idea about the use of various weapons."
1302,"Perhaps the previous way was based on nothing more than fusty old habit, and being forced to rethink it is good for us.",Many people think the previous way was the most efficient.,1,0,False,"step 1: in the premise, the author questions whether the previous way was based on 'nothing more than fusty old habit' and suggests that rethinking it is beneficial. this implies that there was once a belief or practice (the 'previous way') that is now being questioned. it does not provide any explicit information about the efficiency of this previous way.step 2: the hypothesis contradicts the premise, as it asserts that 'many people think the previous way was the most efficient.' this is not logically entailed by the premise, which only implies that the previous way may have been based on habit.step 3: based on the given information, the hypothesis cannot be logically inferred from the premise, as it contradicts it."
1303,This Left Bank area is one of the town's most attractive neighborhoods.,The Left Bank neighborhood borders along the Mississippi river. ,1,1,True,"step 1: in the premise, 'this left bank area' is identified as one of the town's most attractive neighborhoods. this information does not provide any specific details about the location or geographical features of the neighborhood. however, it is a common association that attractive neighborhoods often have desirable features like proximity to parks, nice views, or waterfront locations. step 2: the hypothesis suggests that the left bank neighborhood borders along the mississippi river. while the premise itself does not directly mention the river, the fact that the left bank is a common term for the western side of a river (in this context, the mississippi river) is a well-known fact. thus, the river's presence in the neighborhood is a reasonable assumption based on the common association of the name 'left bank'. step 3: based on the logical connection between 'left bank' and the mississippi river, and the common-sense understanding that attractive neighborhoods can have desirable features like waterfront locations, the hypothesis can be inferred from the premise."
1304,"The authors of the Clean Energy Future (CEF) report describe their analysis as an attempt to assess how energy-efficient and clean energy technologies can address key energy and environmental challenges facing the US (Brown, et al, 2001).",The authors of the Clean Energy Future report are mainly scientists.,1,1,True,"step 1: in the premise, the authors of the clean energy future report are identified, but no specific occupations or titles are mentioned. however, the premise does provide context about their work - they are analyzing energy and environmental challenges and describing their methods as an assessment of energy-efficient and clean energy technologies. this implies a focus on scientific research and analysis. step 2: the hypothesis states that the authors are mainly scientists. this is consistent with the information in the premise. the context of their work and the nature of their analysis aligns with the roles and expertise of scientists. step 3: based on the given context and the logical relationship between the premise and hypothesis, it can be reasonably inferred that the authors are indeed scientists.step 4: the premise provides no contradictory information that would negate the hypothesis. thus, the hypothesis is a logical entailment of the premise."
1305,"Second, with each of those lost sales, it loses a potential user of Internet Explorer.",They are trying to sell people Windows Computers.,1,1,True,"step 1: in the premise, it states that with each lost sale, a potential user of internet explorer is lost. this implies that internet explorer and windows computers are related in some way. it is a common observation that internet explorer is a web browser that comes pre-installed with windows computers. thus, there exists a logical connection between internet explorer and windows computers. step 2: the hypothesis, 'they are trying to sell people windows computers,' can be inferred from the premise because losing potential users of internet explorer directly relates to the sales of windows computers. if they were trying to sell something other than windows computers, the lost sales would not directly correspond to lost potential users of internet explorer. step 3: based on the logical connection between internet explorer and windows computers, and the observation that the lost sales of internet explorer directly relate to the sales of windows computers, the hypothesis is a logical inference from the premise."
1306,"Very little indeed, answered Tuppence, and was pleased to note that Whittington's uneasiness was augmented instead of allayed.",Tuppence made Whittington uncomfortable and was trying to avoid her.,1,1,True,"step 1: the premise describes a conversation between tuppence and whittington, in which tuppence's response 'very little indeed' is given, and it is noted that whittington becomes more uneasy after hearing it. the conversation context is not provided, but there is no overt information suggesting a threat or conflict, which would typically make someone uncomfortable. however, tuppence's reply being unspecific and brief could be interpreted as evasive or hiding something, which might lead to unease in whittington. step 2: the hypothesis suggests that tuppence was trying to avoid whittington, which could be a possible explanation for why her response might make whittington uncomfortable. this inference is consistent with the premise's information, as the uneasiness in whittington is not explicitly explained, leaving room for various interpretations. step 3: based on the provided premise and the common-sense reasoning that someone might try to avoid interaction when they give vague or evasive responses, the hypothesis can be reasonably inferred from the premise."
1307,"From 1992–1997, he served as New York City Council Member representing East Harlem.","From 1992–1997, he served as New York City Council Member representing East Harlem and parts of the Upper West Side and the South Bronx.",1,0,False,"step 1: in the premise, it is stated that he served as new york city council member representing east harlem during the years 1992–1997. no specific information is given about any other areas he represented. step 2: the hypothesis suggests an extension of the information given in the premise, adding the areas of the upper west side and the south bronx to the representation of the new york city council member. step 3: to logically infer the hypothesis from the premise, there should be factual evidence or a logical connection that supports the inclusion of the upper west side and the south bronx in the council member's representation during that time period. however, the premise does not provide any such evidence. therefore, without additional information, it is not possible to logically infer the hypothesis from the premise.step 4: it is important to note that the lack of entailment does not imply contradiction. the hypothesis may be true but not logically deducible based on the available information in the premise."
1308,and uh medical for the rest of your life,Medical for the first three years of employment.,0,0,True,"step 1: in the premise, 'medical' is mentioned without any specific time frame or context. in the hypothesis, 'medical' is specified to the first three years of employment.step 2: the hypothesis does not logically follow from the premise because the premise does not imply or state anything about the duration of 'medical' coverage. the hypothesis introduces a new condition or assumption.step 3: based on the given information and lack of logical connection or implication between the premise and hypothesis, the hypothesis cannot be inferred from the premise."
1310,Don't look too promisin'. ,It looked very promising.,0,0,True,"step 1: in the premise, the verb 'promisin'' is not a common term associated with promising or assuring something. instead, it seems to be a playful, colloquial way of warning someone not to appear overly promising or trustworthy. this context does not provide sufficient information about the state of affairs that 'it' refers to in the premise.step 2: the hypothesis 'it looked very promising' does not logically follow or contradict the premise. the term 'promising' in the hypothesis has a different meaning than in the premise. in the hypothesis, it refers to something that appears likely to succeed or be advantageous, while in the premise it is used in a colloquial sense to warn against appearing overly trustworthy.step 3: based on the given information, the hypothesis cannot be inferred from the premise, as the two sentences convey different meanings."
1311,'I think I can fix this with a simple-',I think there is a simple fix for this plumbing problem. ,1,1,True,"step 1: both the premise and hypothesis are expressed as thoughts or beliefs of a speaker, indicating a subjective perspective. the premise suggests that the speaker is considering a potential solution to a problem using the word 'simple'. the hypothesis also expresses the speaker's belief in a potential solution, specifically a simple one. they share similar structure and meaning.step 2: the hypothesis can be logically inferred from the premise since the premise implies the speaker intends to find a solution, and the hypothesis is a specific instance of that intention. the hypothesis does not contradict the premise in any way, and it is a reasonable conclusion based on the given information.step 3: based on the logical connection between the premise and hypothesis, the hypothesis is a logical entailment of the premise."
1312,"The poorest recipients could actually suffer from the windfall by losing their benefits under Medicaid, food-stamp and other programs.",Poor recipients will lose benefits if they get more than $100.,1,0,False,"step 1: in the premise, it is stated that the poorest recipients could suffer from receiving more resources due to losing their benefits from certain programs. this implies a potential loss of benefits for recipients when they gain more resources. however, the premise does not specify a threshold for the amount that would trigger this loss.step 2: the hypothesis suggests that poor recipients will lose benefits if they get more than $100. this is a more specific and definitive statement than what is implied in the premise.step 3: while the hypothesis is related to the premise, it cannot be logically inferred from it. the premise only indicates a potential loss of benefits when recipients gain more resources, but it does not necessarily mean that the loss occurs at a specific dollar amount. the hypothesis, on the other hand, makes a definitive statement about the loss occurring at $100. therefore, the hypothesis is not entailed by the premise and may be a valid assumption in a specific context but is not a logical conclusion based on the given information alone.step 4: based on the information provided, the hypothesis cannot be confirmed or denied as it goes beyond the scope of the premise."
1313,"Some stores are more like small museums, offering exquisite examples of the finest craftsmanship.",There are many things about the stores that are appealing to many people.,1,1,True,"step 1: in the premise, it is stated that some stores are like small museums, implying they showcase high-quality craftsmanship. this description is not limiting the appeal of the stores to only a specific group of people. in fact, the presence of exquisite examples may broadly attract various people. step 2: the hypothesis, 'there are many things about the stores that are appealing to many people,' is an accurate reflection of the premise because 'many things' about the stores, such as the fine craftsmanship, can appeal to a wide audience. step 3: based on the logical connection between the premise and hypothesis, and the fact that there's no contradictory information in the premise, the hypothesis can be inferred from the premise."
1314,A young man wearing black jumps off a height while people clap.,The man is jumping off something.,1,1,True,"step 1: in the premise, we have the information that a young man wearing black jumps off a height, and people clap. the key information here is that the man jumps off something. this is clear from the verb 'jumps off'. step 2: the hypothesis states that the man is jumping off something, which exactly matches the information in the premise. therefore, the hypothesis can be logically inferred from the premise. step 3: given that both the premise and hypothesis describe the man jumping off something, and there are no contradictory elements in either statement, the hypothesis is entailed by the premise."
1315,You don't need to read the results off graph paper.,You need to read the results off graph paper.,0,0,True,"step 1: the premise states that you don't need to read the results off graph paper, which indicates that the results can be read in another way. common sense and logical understanding of graph paper suggest that the results can indeed be read directly from the graph itself or by observing the plot points on the axes. there are no apparent contradictions in the premise.step 2: the hypothesis, stating that you need to read the results off graph paper, suggests an opposite situation to the premise. this contradicts the information provided in the premise.step 3: based on the logical and common-sense reasoning, the hypothesis 'you need to read the results off graph paper' is not entailed by the premise 'you don't need to read the results off graph paper'. the hypothesis contradicts the premise, making it an incorrect inference."
1316,What does it look like when someone catches fire while strapped to a piece of wood?,"By strapping a body to a piece of wood, fire doesn't necessary burn through organic material.",0,0,True,"step 1. in the premise, the question describes a scenario where someone catches fire while strapped to a piece of wood. the hypothesis suggests that the wood might not burn through in such a situation. step 2. the premise and hypothesis are not directly related, as the premise is asking for an observation of a specific event, while the hypothesis is making a statement about a general property of wood and fire. there is no logical connection between the two. step 3. the hypothesis cannot be logically inferred from the premise, as the premise does not provide enough information to support the hypothesis."
1317,Which is cause and which is effect here is an open question.,There is no need to ask which is the cause here.,0,0,True,"step 1: in the premise, it is stated that which is cause and which is effect is an open question. this means that there is uncertainty or ambiguity regarding the causal relationship between two things. the hypothesis, on the other hand, asserts that there is no need to ask which is the cause here. this implies a definitive answer or resolution to the causality question.step 2: the hypothesis contradicts the premise, as it assumes a situation in which the causality question has been answered or resolved, whereas the premise indicates that this is not the case.step 3: based on the logical analysis, the hypothesis cannot be inferred from the premise as it contradicts it."
1318,"Nature lovers can hike (or rent a donkey) up the extinct volcano of Mount Epomeo, 788 m (2,585 ft), starting from Fontana for unforgettable views of the island and the Bay of Naples.",Donkey rentals produce a good amount of funds for the local economy.,1,1,True,"step 1: in the premise, it is stated that nature lovers can hike up mount epomeo (or rent a donkey) for unforgettable views. the presence of donkey rentals as an alternative mode of transportation up the mountain suggests that this is a common practice. additionally, no facts are provided to contradict the hypothesis.step 2: the hypothesis 'donkey rentals produce a good amount of funds for the local economy' can be inferred from the premise. the reason for this is that the presence of donkey rentals as an option for tourists to reach the mountain top indicates a demand for this service. with the given context, it can be reasonably assumed that this demand generates revenue for the local economy.step 3: based on the logical reasoning and lack of contradictory facts, the hypothesis is entailed by the premise."
1319,Woman with a basket of candy in her hand.,The woman is holding something.,1,1,True,"step 1: in the premise, a woman is described as carrying a basket filled with candy. this implies that she is holding an object. the object in question is explicitly stated as a basket.step 2: the hypothesis 'the woman is holding something' is an entailment of the premise, as holding an object (in this case, a basket) is a necessary condition for the described scene. the hypothesis is a more general statement than the premise, as it does not specify the nature of the object being held. however, the premise implies the hypothesis.step 3: based on logical reasoning and the given information, the hypothesis can be inferred from the premise."
1320,New principle-based accounting and reporting standards should be focused on value and risk.,The old accounting standards didn't focus on value.,1,1,True,"step 1: in the premise, it is stated that new accounting standards should be focused on value and risk. this implies that there is a shift in focus from the old standards. step 2: the hypothesis suggests that the old accounting standards didn't focus on value. this is a reasonable inference, given that the premise indicates a change in focus from the old standards to value and risk. step 3: the hypothesis can be logically inferred from the premise based on the information provided."
1321,was it like a primer,Was it like a base coat? ,0,1,False,"step 1: the premise and hypothesis are both referring to coatings or layers that prepare a surface for further work or application. they are semantically similar and related to each other. the terms 'primer' and 'base coat' are often used interchangeably in painting and coating applications.step 2: the hypothesis 'was it like a base coat?' can be logically inferred from the premise 'was it like a primer' because a primer and a base coat serve similar functions in the application process. both are undercoats that prepare the surface for the next layer.step 3: based on the semantic similarity between the terms and the logical relationship between the functions of primers and base coats, the hypothesis can be inferred from the premise.step  4: it is also important to note that in some contexts, primers and base coats may have subtle differences, but in the absence of additional context, the hypothesis can be considered to be a valid inference based on the information provided in the premise."
1322,"Travel agencies happily provide a range of camping and cooking equipment, as well as the guides, cooks, and porters you need, and a jeep for travelling to more remote and inaccessible areas.",The travel agencies are very helpful to you.,1,1,True,"step 1: in the premise, travel agencies are described as providing a variety of camping and cooking equipment, guides, cooks, porters, and a jeep for camping trips. these actions demonstrate the agencies' role in facilitating and enhancing the camping experience for their clients. they also travel to remote areas, suggesting personalized attention and dedication to customer needs. step 2: the hypothesis 'the travel agencies are very helpful to you' can be logically inferred from the premise as the actions described in the premise directly contribute to making the travel agencies helpful. the premise establishes the travel agencies as providers of essential resources and assistance, which is synonymous with being helpful. step 3: based on the logical reasoning and the common-sense understanding of the term 'helpful', the hypothesis is a logical entailment of the premise."
1323,"When California Caucasians are practicing Feng Shui and Zen meditation, when suburban Asian teens are reciting gangsta rap lyrics, when salsa sales are surging past ketchup sales, how can we speak with a straight face about the ineffaceable whiteness of American life?","The salsa sauce sales are going down every year, there is no way they can bypass ketchup.",0,0,True,"step 1: the premise discusses various scenarios that describe cultural practices and trends in california and american life. however, none of these scenarios directly provide information about the sales figures of salsa or ketchup. step 2: the hypothesis makes a claim about the sales figures of salsa and ketchup. since the premise does not provide any information about the sales figures, it cannot logically entail the hypothesis. step 3: based on the lack of a logical connection between the premise and hypothesis, and the absence of any factual information in the premise that would allow for the inference of the hypothesis, the hypothesis is not entailed by the premise."
1324,", and the other guy does not; and that Sullivan has always had this belief, while the other guy has lost his.",The other guy still shares the belief with Sullivan.,0,0,True,"step 1: the premise states that sullivan has a belief and the other guy does not, with no mention of the other guy ever sharing this belief. it also states that sullivan has always held this belief, while the other guy has lost it. step 2: the hypothesis suggests that the other guy still shares the belief with sullivan, which directly contradicts the information in the premise. step 3: based on the logical inconsistency between the premise and the hypothesis, the hypothesis cannot be inferred from the premise."
1326, Funding Trends and Opportunities to Improve Investment Decisions,Investing in smaller companies can be beneficial.,1,1,True,"step 1: in the premise, there is a mention of 'funding trends and opportunities to improve investment decisions'. this implies a discussion about various strategies and tactics to make informed investment decisions. the term 'smaller companies' is not explicitly mentioned in the premise but could be an inferred element, as investment strategies often include considerations for different company sizes. step 2: the hypothesis suggests that investing in smaller companies can be beneficial. this alignment with the premise's context indicates a potential logical connection. step 3: research shows that investing in smaller companies can offer diversification benefits, potentially higher growth rates, and lower valuations compared to larger companies. these factors are often considered when seeking to improve investment decisions. therefore, the hypothesis can be inferred from the premise as it aligns with the broader context of making informed investment decisions.step 4: it's essential to note that while the hypothesis can be inferred, it doesn't necessarily mean that investing in smaller companies is guaranteed to be beneficial. the success or failure of such investments depends on various factors, including thorough research, market conditions, and individual investment goals.step 5: therefore, based on the logical reasoning and contextual alignment, the hypothesis can be considered entailed by the premise, but it's crucial to remember the importance of due diligence and careful consideration when making investment decisions."
1327,"She didn't know about it, Curry said of the drug deal.",Curry said that she was unaware of the drug deal.,1,1,True,"step 1: in the premise, curry is reported to have stated that 'she didn't know about it.' this implies that curry made a claim about someone else's knowledge or awareness regarding a drug deal. step 2: the hypothesis also states that 'curry said' something, which corresponds to the initial part of the premise. the hypothesis then specifies that curry said 'that she was unaware of the drug deal.' this is an exact paraphrase of the claim made in the premise. step 3: since the hypothesis is an exact paraphrase of the premise, it can be logically inferred from the premise. this is an instance of synonymy, where two expressions convey the same meaning but may differ in wording or structure."
1328,those events were always free,The free events were the best ones anyway.,1,0,False,"step 1: in the premise, 'those events were always free', the key information is that certain events did not require payment. there are no logical connections or contradictions within the premise. step 2: the hypothesis, 'the free events were the best ones anyway', does not logically follow the premise, as there is no direct connection between the events being free and them being the best. the hypothesis is an opinion or a subjective statement. step 3: since the hypothesis is not logically entailed by the premise, it cannot be inferred from it."
1329,A husky and a black cat nuzzling.,A dog and cat together.,1,1,True,"step 1: both the premise and hypothesis describe a situation involving a dog and a cat. the premise provides a specific instance of them engaging in the behavior of nuzzling. step 2: the hypothesis is a more general description of the situation, as it only mentions that a dog and cat are present together. the behavior of nuzzling is a type of interaction that can occur between these animals when they are together. step 3: given that the hypothesis is a less specific version of the premise, and the information in the premise is sufficient to logically infer the hypothesis, the hypothesis can be inferred from the premise."
1330,I tried asking myself what I would do.,I didn't consider it at all.,0,0,True,"step 1: the premise indicates that the speaker engaged in introspection, trying to figure out what they would do. this implies that the speaker gave some thought to the matter. step 2: the hypothesis suggests that the speaker did not consider the matter at all. this contradicts the premise because if the speaker didn't consider it at all, they wouldn't have tried asking themselves what they would do. step 3: based on the logical inconsistency between the premise and hypothesis, the hypothesis is not entailed by the premise."
1331,"The momentum for change was growing, and in 1831 a black lay preacher named  Daddy  Sam Sharpe led a revolt of 20,000 slaves at Montego Bay.",Daddy Sam Sharpe had many supporters of his revolt.,1,1,True,"step 1: in the premise, it is mentioned that daddy sam sharpe led a revolt of 20,000 slaves at montego bay in 1831. this implies that a significant number of slaves supported his cause to revolt. the term 'revolt' indicates that a group of people took collective action to bring about change. step 2: the hypothesis, 'daddy sam sharpe had many supporters of his revolt,' is directly stated and logically follows from the information in the premise. the premise implies that there was a large number of slaves involved in the revolt, and the hypothesis explicitly states that these slaves supported daddy sam sharpe. step 3: based on the logical relationship between the premise and hypothesis, and the absence of contradictory information, the hypothesis can be inferred from the premise."
1332,and there's some really neat stuff they can do now with computers and and some of the cartoons are just hilarious um,They don't use computers at all.,0,0,True,"step 1: in the premise, it is mentioned that 'they' (presumably animators or creators) can do 'neat stuff' with computers and some cartoons are 'hilarious'. this implies that computers are used in the creation process of these cartoons. step 2: contradictorily, the hypothesis states that 'they don't use computers at all'. since the hypothesis directly contradicts the premise, it cannot be logically inferred from the premise. step 3: based on the logical negation of the premise and the contradictory nature of the hypothesis, it is clear that the hypothesis is not entailed by the premise."
1333,and that helps on utilities,It has no impact on utilities.,0,0,True,"step 1: the premise describes a situation where 'that' (an unspecified thing) helps 'on utilities'. the meaning of 'utilities' in this context is not clear without additional information. step 2: the hypothesis states that 'it has no impact on utilities'. this contradicts the premise if 'that' is assumed to have a direct effect on utilities. however, without specific information about 'that' and 'utilities', it's unreasonable to infer a definitive relationship. step 3: based on the lack of clear information and logical principles, it's impossible to determine if the hypothesis is entailed by the premise or not."
1334,"It was designated the home of the treasury of the Delian League in 480 b.c. , an act which encouraged its growth as a center for banking and commerce.",The Delian League also designated this as the capital.  ,1,0,False,"step 1: in the premise, it is mentioned that the site was designated as the home of the delian league's treasury in 480 b.c. this act encouraged its growth as a center for banking and commerce. the premise does not explicitly state that the site was designated as the capital of the delian league. however, the designation of a treasury and the growth of banking and commerce often imply a central location or capital status. step 2: the hypothesis suggests that the delian league designated this site as the capital. while the premise does not explicitly state this, it does not contradict the hypothesis. the growth of banking and commerce at the site could indicate its status as a capital. however, the premise alone does not logically entail the hypothesis. step 3: based on the given information, the hypothesis is not logically entailed by the premise. while the premise implies that the site was an important center for the delian league, it does not necessarily mean that it was the capital."
1335,"As I have discussed, my predecessors did a tremendous amount to ensure that GAO had the capacity and capabilities to serve the Congress and prepare for the future during their tenure.",My predecessors did not put any effort into improving GAO.,0,0,True,"step 1: in the premise, the speaker is acknowledging the significant contributions made by their predecessors in enhancing gao's capacity and preparing for the future. this implies that they put in a considerable amount of effort to improve gao. step 2: the hypothesis contradicts the premise as it suggests that their predecessors did not put any effort into improving gao. step 3: based on the contradictory nature of the hypothesis and the information provided in the premise, the hypothesis cannot be logically inferred from the premise.step 4: it is important to note that the premise is a statement made by the speaker about their predecessors. the hypothesis is an opposing statement. without additional context or evidence, it is not possible to definitively determine which statement is factually correct. the premise and hypothesis are not logically equivalent, and the premise does not entail the hypothesis."
1336,i agree with you but did you see the map they drew up on uh on how they were gonna divide up the districts,The district divisions map was incomplete.,1,0,False,"step 1: in the premise, it is mentioned that a map was drawn up to divide up districts. however, the premise does not provide any information about the completeness or accuracy of this map. step 2: the hypothesis suggests that the map was incomplete. this is not a direct contradiction to the premise, as the premise does not state that the map was complete. however, the premise also does not provide any evidence to support the hypothesis. step 3: based on the given information, it is not possible to logically infer that the hypothesis is entailed by the premise. the hypothesis makes an additional assumption about the map that is not directly supported by the premise."
1337,my um husband's father has a place out in East Texas so he's always digging up little red oaks and things like that and trying to bring them back and start them but,My husband takes little red oaks with him when he visits East Texas.,0,1,False,"step 1. in the premise, it is stated that the father-in-law of the speaker's husband regularly digs up little red oaks and tries to bring them back to start at his place. this indicates that the speaker's husband often accompanies his father-in-law during these visits to east texas. step 2. the hypothesis suggests that the speaker's husband personally brings little red oaks back with him when he visits east texas. this can be reasonably inferred from the premise as the speaker's husband is present during the father-in-law's actions of digging up and transporting the little red oaks. step 3. based on the logical relationship between the premise and hypothesis, and the common-sense understanding of the described situation, the hypothesis can be inferred from the premise."
1338,"As a referee looks on, a Los Angeles baseball player is falling over the top of a rival player who is just sliding into base.",The people are playing basketball.,0,0,True,"step 1: in the premise, we have the description of a scene where a referee is observing a baseball player falling over another player who is sliding into a base. this implies a baseball game. common sense and factual knowledge tell us that baseball and basketball are two distinct sports. step 2: the hypothesis suggests an entirely different context - people playing basketball. there is no logical connection or inference that can be drawn from the premise to the hypothesis. the actions described do not match the hypothesis in any way. step 3: based on the lack of logical connection and the significant differences between the premise and hypothesis, the hypothesis cannot be inferred from the premise."
1339,you know i think there's so much prejudice still there and it's kind of more covert now people used to be more clear and say you know well i believe in this or i believe in that and now,People are more upfront about their prejudices than they used to be. ,0,0,True,"step 1. in the premise, the speaker acknowledges the existence of prejudice and its covert nature, suggesting that people hide their prejudices less openly than they used to. however, the speaker's opinion implies that prejudice is now more overt. step 2. the hypothesis directly contradicts the premise's stated opinion, as it suggests the opposite of what the speaker believes. step 3. the hypothesis cannot be logically inferred from the premise. contradictory statements cannot be derived from each other."
1340,there was a lot more to it than that as a matter of fact that was a very minor part that kind of become like an afterthought,The process was less than I thought.,0,1,False,"step 1: in the premise, the speaker acknowledges that there were more complexities or elements to a situation that were initially overlooked or underestimated. the 'minor part' mentioned became insignificant in comparison to the newfound understanding.step 2: the hypothesis suggests a revision or correction of the speaker's initial perception, implying that the process was less extensive or demanding than what was initially assumed. this interpretation is consistent with the premise as both revolve around the idea of underestimation.step 3: based on the logical connection between the premise and hypothesis, and given that neither contradicts the other, the hypothesis can be inferred from the premise as a possible explanation for the speaker's revised understanding."
1341,Entrance prices of around 60-120F may include your first drink,leaving prices of around 60-120F may include your last drink,0,0,True,"step 1. the premise describes entrance prices that range from 60-120f, and it mentions that the first drink might be included in this price range. this implies that there is an entrance fee that grants access to the venue and possibly one drink.step 2. the hypothesis suggests that leaving prices might include your last drink. leaving prices refer to the cost of leaving a venue, usually in the context of a cover charge or a minimum consumption charge, which is typically higher than the entrance fee. it's not common for the leaving price to include the first drink, but it's reasonable for it to include the last drink, especially if the venue enforces a minimum consumption policy.step 3. although the premise and hypothesis address different aspects of the prices at a venue, they do not contradict each other. the hypothesis is not logically inferred from the premise, but it is not a contradiction either. both sentences can coexist, depending on the specific policies or practices of the venue.step 4. based on the given information, the hypothesis cannot be logically inferred from the premise, as the premise does not provide any information about the last drink or leaving prices. however, they are not contradictory, and the hypothesis is plausible under certain circumstances."
1342,"The Independent of London devoted an editorial to the report, denied by the White House, that Clinton might be willing to admit that he kissed Monica Lewinsky without engaging with her in an improper relationship.",Clinton denied ever knowing Lewinsky.,1,0,False,"step 1: in the premise, it is mentioned that there was a report that clinton might be willing to admit to kissing monica lewinsky but denied any improper relationship. this implies that there were allegations of an improper relationship between clinton and lewinsky. the hypothesis, on the other hand, suggests that clinton denied knowing lewinsky at all.step 2: the hypothesis 'clinton denied ever knowing lewinsky' is not a direct logical entailment from the premise. while the premise implies that clinton was denying an improper relationship with lewinsky, it does not necessarily mean that he denied ever knowing her. these are two distinct claims.step 3: based on the given information, the hypothesis cannot be logically inferred from the premise as it is not an entailed consequence. the premise only provides context about clinton's denial of an improper relationship, whereas the hypothesis makes a stronger claim about his denial of any prior knowledge of lewinsky."
1343,A rural route is defined in terms of the roads it traverses.,Many rural routes span several counties and even cross state lines.,1,1,True,"step 1: in the premise, a rural route is defined by the roads it traverses. this definition implies that the route covers a certain distance and passes through various locations, which could include multiple counties or even states. step 2: the hypothesis states that many rural routes span several counties and even cross state lines. this statement extends the information given in the premise by providing more specific details about the scope of rural routes. step 3: the hypothesis can be inferred from the premise as it is a reasonable extension of the given definition. it is common for rural routes to traverse large areas, and crossing county or state lines is a natural consequence of traversing a large, rural area. therefore, the hypothesis is entailed by the premise."
1344,I've known a lot of big men that will piss themselves if they feel their own blood rolling down their neck but she didn't.,"She shrieked at the feeling of even her own sweat on her body, let alone the blood over her back.",0,0,True,"step 1: in the premise, the speaker is describing a situation where they have known large men who are easily intimidated or frightened, causing them to urinate when they feel a sense of threat, such as the feeling of their own blood. the hypothesis introduces a new character who, contrary to the large men described, remained composed in the face of her own bodily fluids, specifically her sweat.step 2: the hypothesis does not logically follow from the premise. the premise does not provide any information about the fear response or lack thereof of the new character, 'she'. the hypothesis introduces a new fear response (shrieking at the feeling of her own sweat) that is not mentioned or implied in the premise.step 3: based on the given information, the hypothesis cannot be logically inferred from the premise."
1345,This fireworks' 20 minutes was the only 20 minutes during which 25 to 35 percent of the audience was not talking to or hearing from someone who wasn't with them.,I am talking about this fireworks' 50 minutes.,0,0,True,"step 1. in the premise, it is stated that during the fireworks' 20 minutes, there was a period where 25-35% of the audience was not interacting with someone outside their group. this implies that for the majority of the fireworks' duration, people were interacting with others.step 2. the hypothesis suggests a different duration of 50 minutes instead of 20 minutes mentioned in the premise. however, based on the information given, there is no logical connection between the premise and hypothesis. the premise does not provide enough information to infer or deduce the hypothesis.step 3. in conclusion, the hypothesis cannot be logically inferred from the premise as the premise does not provide sufficient evidence or logical connection to support the hypothesis."
1346,The player from the black team is telling something to the player of the red team.,The teams have purple and yellow uniforms.,0,0,True,"step 1: in the premise, we have two players identified by their team colors, black and red. however, there is no information about what the players are wearing or what colors their uniforms are. the premise only tells us about their team affiliations and an action they are performing (talking to each other). step 2: the hypothesis does not logically follow from the premise, as there is no information in the premise about the uniform colors. step 3: based on the lack of information in the premise about the uniform colors, it is not possible to logically infer the hypothesis from the premise."
1347,"The 1992-93 famine lacked the central direction of a genocide, and its victims were not murdered on the basis of race, ethnicity, nationality, or religion.",The 1992-93 was as targeted as a genocide.,0,0,True,"step 1: in the premise, it is stated that the 1992-93 famine did not have a central direction of a genocide and the victims were not targeted based on race, ethnicity, nationality, or religion. this implies that the famine was not intentionally and systematically directed against a particular group. step 2: the hypothesis suggests that the 1992-93 famine was 'as targeted as a genocide.' however, the premise clearly states that it was not a genocide. therefore, the hypothesis contradicts the premise. step 3: based on the logical reasoning, the hypothesis cannot be inferred from the premise as it contradicts the information provided in the premise."
1348,GAO reserves the right to issue the report to the congressional requester(s) if the comments are not received within the time allotted.,The reports will be issued by the GAO in the future. ,1,1,True,"step 1: in the premise, gao reserves the right to issue a report to congressional requesters if comments are not received within a certain time frame. this does not necessarily mean that reports will always be withheld due to lack of comments, but it does indicate that reports can be issued without them. step 2: the hypothesis states that reports will be issued by the gao in the future. this is an entailment of the premise, as the premise clearly states that reports can be issued by gao. step 3: based on the logical connection between the premise and hypothesis, the hypothesis can be inferred from the premise."
1349,"Susan M. Hoffman, the pro bono coordinator at Washington, D.C.'s Crowell  and  Moring, regularly receives queries from non-profit organizations via email.",Hoffman coordinates pro bono and quid pro quo talks.,1,1,True,"step 1: in the premise, susan m. hoffman is identified as the pro bono coordinator at crowell & moring in washington, d.c. it is mentioned that she regularly receives queries from non-profit organizations via email. step 2: the term 'pro bono coordinator' implies that susan hoffman oversees and manages pro bono work within the firm. quid pro quo talks are a common part of pro bono arrangements, allowing organizations to offer something of value in exchange for legal services. step 3: based on the information provided in the premise and the logical connection between the role of a pro bono coordinator and the possibility of coordinating quid pro quo talks, the hypothesis can be inferred. step 4: it is important to note that the hypothesis is not explicitly stated in the premise, but it can be logically derived from the given information."
1350,this is The Mansion at Turtle Creek a tip i bet these are really good seats and so we ended up on first base right down there on the floor and you know we just they called us at five and the game started at seven so we just threw everything together ran over and got the tickets and,"They told us our tickets were fake, so we went to the bar down the street.",0,0,True,"step 1: in the premise, the speakers suddenly receive tickets for a baseball game and end up on the floor due to a last-minute call. the sequence of events described does not suggest any issues with the authenticity of the tickets. step 2: the hypothesis introduces a contradiction to the premise, stating that the tickets were fake. however, there is no information in the premise that supports or implies the hypothesis. step 3: based on the lack of connection or logical relationship between the premise and hypothesis, the hypothesis cannot be inferred from the premise."
1351,"Broadly speaking, the CEF Moderate scenario can be thought of as a 50% increase in funding for programs that promote a variety of both demand-side and supply-side technologies.",The CEF Moderate scenario can be thought of as a 10% decrease in funding for programs.,0,0,True,"step 1: in the premise, the cef moderate scenario is described as an increase of 50% in funding for programs promoting demand-side and supply-side technologies. this implies that the current funding level is serving as a base, and an additional 50% is being added. common sense and factual knowledge don't suggest a decrease in funding based on the given context.step 2: the hypothesis states that the cef moderate scenario can be thought of as a 10% decrease in funding. this contradicts the premise as the premise clearly states an increase and not a decrease.step 3: based on the logical negation of the premise and the contradiction between the premise and hypothesis, the hypothesis is not entailed by the premise."
1352,"As one of the primary funders of civil equal justice in every state, LSC has a duty to stimulate the most effective means of delivering legal services to low-in-come individuals.",The LSC should help the low income individuals.,1,1,True,"step 1: in the premise, it is stated that lsc is one of the primary funders of civil equal justice in every state and has a duty to stimulate effective means of delivering legal services to low-income individuals. this implies that lsc plays a crucial role in ensuring access to legal services for those who cannot afford it.step 2: the hypothesis suggests that lsc should help low-income individuals. this is directly in line with the premise since lsc's primary role is to help low-income individuals. the hypothesis can be seen as an implication or a more specific manifestation of the duties and responsibilities mentioned in the premise.step 3: based on the logical connection between the premise and hypothesis, the hypothesis can be inferred from the premise."
1353,"Jesse Ventura is the product of Minnesota political culture, with its mix of Yankee and Germanic reformism and its long history of influential regional third-party movements such as the Nonpartisan League and the Farmer-Labor party.",Jesse Ventura is the predictable result of the completely backward political culture in Minnesota. ,1,0,False,"step 1: in the premise, we have information about jesse ventura being a product of minnesota political culture, which is characterized by a mix of yankee and germanic reformism and a history of influential regional third-party movements. this information does not inherently suggest that the political culture in minnesota is 'completely backward'.step 2: the hypothesis, 'jesse ventura is the predictable result of the completely backward political culture in minnesota', contradicts the information in the premise. the premise describes minnesota political culture as having a rich history of reformism and influential third-party movements, while the hypothesis implies that this culture is backward.step 3: based on the provided information, the hypothesis cannot be logically inferred from the premise, as they are in contradiction."
1354,A man in a black hoodie watching a man in a red cap.,There is a man watching another man.,1,1,True,"step 1: both the premise and hypothesis describe a scenario involving one man observing another man. the key details in the premise are 'a man in a black hoodie' and 'watching a man in a red cap'. these details are not essential to the relationship between the two men, which is that one man is observing the other. step 2: the hypothesis can be logically inferred from the premise because it describes a broader version of the scene in the premise. the premise specifies certain details about the men involved, but the hypothesis only requires that there are two men with one observing the other. step 3: based on logical reasoning and the absence of contradictory information, the hypothesis can be inferred from the premise."
1355,trying to write an essay you start talking about you know like In Living Color or something i don't know,When you're out of essay ideas you talk about In Living Color or something,1,1,True,"step 1: the premise describes a situation where a person is struggling to write an essay and resorts to speaking about 'in living color' or something. this implies a lack of ideas for the essay. step 2: the hypothesis suggests that when a person runs out of essay ideas, they talk about 'in living color' or something as a substitute. this is a reasonable inference from the premise, as the hypothesis explains the observed behavior in the premise as a result of running out of essay ideas. step 3: based on the logical connection between the premise and hypothesis, common sense understanding, and factual consistency, the hypothesis can be inferred from the premise.step 4: it is also important to note that there is no contradictory information in the premise or hypothesis, and both statements are consistent with each other and the real world.therefore, the hypothesis can be logically inferred from the premise."
1356,"The man Whittington is probably the head of the English branch.""",The man Whittington works for the English Branch.,1,0,False,"step 1. in the premise, 'the man whittington is probably the head of the english branch' implies that man whittington holds a position of authority or leadership within the english branch. step 2. the hypothesis 'the man whittington works for the english branch' indicates that man whittington is an employee or laborer for the english branch. while the roles of 'head' and 'employee' are distinct, the premise does not explicitly rule out that the man whittington also works for the english branch. in fact, the man whittington could potentially be both the head and an employee, depending on the specific organizational structure of the english branch. step 3. given the information provided, it is not clear that the hypothesis can be logically inferred from the premise, as the premise does not directly establish that man whittington performs any specific work for the english branch."
1357,"The artist was a notable member of the Young British Artists movement, which included Sarah Lucas and Damien Hirst.","The artist was a notable member of the Young British Artists movement, which included Paul Kelly and Damien Hirst.",0,1,False,"step 1: in the premise, the artist is identified as a notable member of the young british artists movement, and two other artists, sarah lucas and damien hirst, are mentioned as part of the same group. there is no contradictory information provided in the premise.step 2: the hypothesis states that paul kelly is also a notable member of the young british artists movement, in addition to damien hirst. this information does not contradict the premise, as paul kelly is simply being added to the list of artists known to be part of the young british artists movement.step 3: based on the given information, there is no reason to conclude that the hypothesis cannot be inferred from the premise. in fact, the hypothesis expands the information in the premise by adding an additional artist to the known members of the young british artists movement.therefore, the hypothesis can be logically inferred from the premise."
1358,But there ARE places in London where simply every one is bound to turn up sooner or later.,"There are places in London where everyone turns up, alive or dead, eventually.",1,1,True,"step 1: in the premise, 'there are places in london where simply every one is bound to turn up sooner or later', the phrase 'every one' refers to all people, and 'turn up' could mean appearing or showing up. the context suggests that these places have a high probability of drawing people there, possibly due to their popularity or significance.step 2: the hypothesis, 'there are places in london where everyone turns up, alive or dead, eventually' aligns with the premise as it also refers to places in london that draw people, but it expands on the concept by including the possibility of people appearing alive or dead. the hypothesis does not contradict the premise and is a logical extension of it.step 3: based on the similarity in meaning and the logical connection between the premise and hypothesis, the hypothesis can be inferred from the premise."
1359,Easier access to birth-control information and devices and to abortion could reduce the number of unwanted children and improve the timing of those whose mothers would have preferred to wait.,Birth control has no effect on the numbers of unwanted children.,0,0,True,"step 1: in the premise, it is suggested that easier access to birth control information and devices, as well as to abortion, could lead to a reduction in the number of unwanted children and an improvement in the timing of pregnancies. this implies a causal relationship between easier access to birth control and a decrease in unwanted births.step 2: the hypothesis, however, asserts that birth control has no effect on the numbers of unwanted children. this statement directly contradicts the premise, as the premise asserts that birth control does have an effect on the numbers of unwanted children.step 3: based on the logical reasoning and the contradiction between the premise and hypothesis, the hypothesis cannot be logically inferred from the premise."
1360,He watched the river flow.,The river levels were rising.,1,0,False,"step 1: the premise describes an action of someone observing the river. the verb 'flow' implies a continuous motion or movement of the river. it is a common occurrence for river levels to rise when there is an increased flow of water. step 2: the hypothesis suggests a condition of the river's levels, which is compatible with the observed flow in the premise. an increased flow can lead to rising levels, and it is not unreasonable to assume that 'he watched the river flow' implies that he noticed the rising levels if they were happening at the time. step 3: based on the logical relationship between 'flow' and 'rising levels' and the possibility that the observation in the premise could include the notice of rising levels, the hypothesis can be inferred from the premise, although it might not be a definitive or necessary conclusion."
1361,Opposite the Macau Ferry Terminal you'll find the Western Market (open 10am 7pm).,The Western Market sells various imported products from the United States.,1,0,False,"step 1: in the premise, we learn that the western market is located opposite the macau ferry terminal and its operating hours are from 10am to 7pm. this information does not provide any details about the types of products sold in the market. step 2: the hypothesis states that the western market sells various imported products from the united states. this is not directly contradictory to the information in the premise, but it does add new information, that is, the market sells imported products from a specific country. step 3: there is no logical necessity for the hypothesis to follow from the premise. the premise only provides the location and operating hours of the market, while the hypothesis introduces new information about the types of products sold. this information could be true, but it cannot be logically inferred from the given premise alone. step 4: to determine if the hypothesis is entailed by the premise, we would need additional evidence or context suggesting that the western market in macau is known for selling imported products from the united states. in the absence of such evidence, the hypothesis is not logically entailed by the premise."
1362,"When the return to stockholders rises by 150 percent, so must the price of your company's stock.",Stock price doesn't have to increase just because shareholder return is extremely high.,0,0,True,"step 1: in the premise, there is a stated relationship between the increase in return to shareholders and the subsequent increase in stock price. however, this relationship is not necessarily a logical one. it is a common belief in finance that a higher return to shareholders can lead to a higher stock price, as investors may view this as a positive sign. however, this is not always the case. share price is determined by market forces and investor sentiment, which can be influenced by factors unrelated to return to shareholders. step 2: the hypothesis states that an extremely high return to shareholders does not logically imply an increase in stock price. this is a valid perspective, as the premise does not establish a causal relationship between the two. there are numerous instances where companies have reported significant increases in return to shareholders without corresponding increases in stock price. for example, a company might choose to reinvest profits rather than distribute them as dividends, which could keep the stock price relatively stable despite high returns. step 3: based on the analysis above, the hypothesis cannot be logically inferred from the premise, as the premise does not establish a causal relationship between return to shareholders and stock price."
1363,"Advances in FGD technology, design, materials, and expertise available for retrofit installations made over the last decade form a sharp contrast to earlier retrofit systems.",The retrofit systems of today are almost exactly the same as the systems ten years ago.,0,0,True,"step 1: in the premise, it is stated that there have been significant advances in fgd technology, design, materials, and expertise for retrofit installations over the last decade. this implies a substantial improvement or difference in the retrofit systems of today compared to those from a decade ago. step 2: the hypothesis asserts that there has been no change or that the retrofit systems of today are the same as those from a decade ago. this directly contradicts the information given in the premise. step 3: based on the logical negation of the premise in the hypothesis, it is clear that the hypothesis is not entailed by the premise."
1364,FEMA and VBA were selected because a literature review of relevant articles indicated that front-line employees from those agencies had been empowered or involved in key agency decisions or operations.,FEMA and VBA were picked because the literature review found front-line employees were involved in hiring decision making.,1,1,True,"step 1: in the premise, fema and vba were selected based on a literature review that indicated front-line employees from these agencies had been empowered or involved in key agency decisions or operations. this implies that these employees have significant influence or decision-making authority within their respective organizations.step 2: the hypothesis suggests that fema and vba were picked because front-line employees were involved in hiring decision making. this is a specific type of decision-making and a subset of the 'key agency decisions or operations' mentioned in the premise.step 3: the hypothesis can be inferred from the premise because the premise establishes that front-line employees at fema and vba have a significant role in decision-making processes, and the hypothesis posits that these decisions include hiring. since hiring is a type of decision-making, it is a logical extension of the premise to infer that hiring decisions may be made by these employees. therefore, the hypothesis can be inferred from the premise.step 4: the reasoning is grounded in the given information, logical principles, and common-sense understanding. the premise and hypothesis both refer to decision-making roles of front-line employees at fema and vba, and the hypothesis is a specific instance of the broader decision-making role mentioned in the premise."
1365,"GAO has never had a centralized, formal program to reduce its travel costs by capturing and using its employees' official travel miles.",The GAO tracks and captures all program miles earned by its employees.,0,0,True,"step 1: in the premise, it is stated that gao has never had a formal program to reduce travel costs by capturing and using its employees' official travel miles. this implies that gao does not have a systematic process in place for tracking and recording travel miles. step 2: the hypothesis suggests that gao tracks and captures all program miles earned by its employees. this contradicts the information in the premise, as the premise states that gao does not have such a system in place. step 3: based on the given information, the hypothesis cannot be logically inferred from the premise."
1366,A man in a green jersey and rollerskates stumbles as a man in a black jersey appears to collide with him.,The man stumbles stumbles in rollerskates.,1,1,True,"step 1: in the premise, we have key information about a man in a green jersey who stumbles while another man in a black jersey appears to collide with him. the actions described do not necessarily imply the cause of the man in green's stumble. however, the premise provides no contradictory information and is factually consistent with the hypothesis. step 2: the hypothesis asserts that the man stumbles because of his rollerskates, which is a plausible explanation based on the given context. it is a common sense understanding that roller skates can make a person stumble, especially when collided with. step 3: given the lack of contradictory information and the logical connection between the man's stumble and the roller skates, the hypothesis can be inferred from the premise."
1367,Israel i saw that on Twenty uh 20/20 or something last week you know the about the migration and it's just and and jeez i don't know what their doing with all the people,There must be so many people coming into Israel.,1,1,True,"step 1. in the premise, the speaker mentions that they saw a report about israel and migration on a news show (20/20). the speaker expresses their confusion about the large number of people coming into israel. step 2. the hypothesis infers that 'there must be so many people coming into israel' based on the information provided in the premise. the hypothesis is a logical conclusion if we assume that the speaker's confusion about 'what they're doing with all the people' in the premise is due to the large number of people entering israel. step 3. given the speaker's statement about their confusion and the information from the premise, it is a valid inference that 'there must be so many people coming into israel'.step 4. it is also important to note that there are no contradictory facts or logical inconsistencies in the premise or hypothesis, making the inference even more valid.step 5. in conclusion, the hypothesis can be reasonably inferred from the premise as it is a logical consequence of the information presented."
1368,that's what we we got rid of an American Express card for the same reason is though we have a a credit union and we get our cards our other MasterCards for free so we don't have to pay a a fee at all,We got rid of our American Express card because we couldn't afford the yearly fee.,1,1,True,"step 1: in the premise, it is stated that they got rid of their american express card because they have other mastercards from their credit union that they don't have to pay fees for. this implies that the reason for getting rid of the american express card was to avoid paying a fee.step 2: the hypothesis suggests that they couldn't afford the yearly fee as the reason for getting rid of the american express card. this is a reasonable inference given the information in the premise, as not being able to afford a fee is a common reason for cancelling a card.step 3: based on the information provided, the hypothesis can be logically inferred from the premise."
1369,yeah  not lately though,More frequently now than it was.,0,0,True,"step 1: in the premise, 'yeah' is a colloquial affirmation that can signify agreement or acknowledgement, but it does not provide clear or specific information about a subject or relationship. 'not lately though' implies a recent change from a previous state or frequency. however, this change is not defined in the premise.step 2: the hypothesis, 'more frequently now than it was', proposes a change in frequency. this potential change could be related to the 'not lately though' part of the premise, but the premise does not provide enough detail to confirm this relationship. without more context or specific information, it's not possible to determine if the hypothesis can be logically inferred from the premise.step 3: based on the limited information provided, the hypothesis cannot be definitively inferred from the premise. the premise does not contain enough detail or specificity to support the hypothesis."
1370,"The mansion, a fine Neo-Classical Italian villa, was actually built for Alfred Mitchell, an American who lived here with his family for a number of years.",The Italian villa was built in Italy in 2001.,0,0,True,"step 1: in the premise, we learn that the mansion is a neo-classical italian villa, built for an american named alfred mitchell and his family. no information is given about when or where the villa was actually built. step 2: the hypothesis states that the italian villa was built in italy in 2001. however, the premise does not provide any information about the year or the location of the villa's construction. also, the hypothesis contradicts the information given in the premise that alfred mitchell and his family lived in the villa for a number of years. step 3: based on the given information and logical principles, it is not possible to logically infer the hypothesis from the premise. the hypothesis contradicts the factual information in the premise and lacks sufficient evidence to be logically inferred."
1371,"Then this here war was over, an' I was loose.",The war is not over yet.,0,0,True,"step 1: in the premise, 'then this here war was over' indicates that the speaker believes the war has ended at the time they are speaking. this is a past tense statement. step 2: the hypothesis, 'the war is not over yet', is a contradictory statement to the premise. if the war is not over yet, then it was not over 'then' as stated in the premise. step 3: based on the logical contradiction and the clear meaning of the premise and hypothesis, the hypothesis cannot be inferred from the premise."
1372,"From an analytical perspective, this means that prices are based on the marginal costs of generation, transmission and distribution of electricity rather than the regulated, cost-of-service pricing now used throughout much of the country.",We have to change the way we price things.,1,0,False,"step 1: the premise describes a situation where the pricing of electricity is based on marginal costs instead of regulated cost-of-service pricing. this change in pricing method is a significant shift in how the market operates. step 2: the hypothesis does not directly relate to or contradict the premise, but it implies that a change might be necessary due to the new pricing structure. however, the hypothesis does not specify what needs to be changed or how. step 3: it's not possible to determine entailment based on the given information alone. the hypothesis is too vague and open-ended to be logically inferred from the premise."
1373,"Until the 1990s, federal agencies often maintained an inhouse facilities engineering organization, comprised in part of architects and engineers, responsible for both the technical aspects and the oversight of the planning and design phases of the acquisition process.",The federal agents are deeply trained in maintaining in house facilities. ,1,1,True,"step 1: the premise describes a historical context where federal agencies had their own facilities engineering organizations, which included architects and engineers. this implies that these agencies had the expertise and resources to handle the technical aspects and oversight of the planning and design phases of their facilities acquisition process in-house. step 2: the hypothesis aligns with the information in the premise, as it suggests that the federal agents had a deep level of training in maintaining in-house facilities. the premise establishes that the agencies had the necessary personnel and responsibility for these tasks, which can be inferred as implying a deep level of training for these individuals. step 3: based on the logical connection between the premise and hypothesis, and the common sense understanding that having an in-house organization implies some level of expertise and training for the individuals involved, the hypothesis can be logically inferred from the premise."
1374,"It was these statesmen who created a relatively secure micro-economy for the Lakes region, an economy based on agriculture and small-scale industry such as the production of textiles, bobbins, and charcoal.",The micro-economy was found to be sufficiently stable for many years.,1,1,True,"step 1: the premise states that these statesmen created a relatively secure micro-economy in the lakes region, which was based on agriculture and small-scale industry. this implies that the economy was stable enough to support the activities mentioned. step 2: the hypothesis suggests that the micro-economy was sufficiently stable 'for many years'. this is consistent with the information provided in the premise, as there is no indication in the premise that the economy was unstable during this period. step 3: based on the logical reasoning and the lack of contradictory information, the hypothesis can be inferred from the premise."
1375,"(In the short run, higher-income taxpayers may pay more taxes, not less, if a capgains rate cut leads them to sell more assets than they otherwise would have done.)",Low income people will face a tax increase.,1,0,False,"step 1. in the premise, it is stated that higher-income taxpayers may pay more taxes as a result of a capital gains rate cut leading them to sell more assets. this information does not directly relate to the situation of low-income people and their taxes.step 2. the hypothesis proposes a different scenario, suggesting that low-income people will face a tax increase. the premise does not logically entail or imply this outcome for low-income individuals.step 3. based on the given information, the hypothesis is not entailed by the premise."
1376,Every part of him appeared designed to stab the blade through that man as if it were the only action he could take.,He didn't look like he was going to stab anything.,0,0,True,"step 1: the premise describes a man whose actions and appearance suggest a strong likelihood of using a blade to harm another person. this inference is based on the language 'designed to stab' and 'blade through that man'. step 2: the hypothesis, on the other hand, states the opposite. it suggests that the man didn't look like he was going to stab anything. these two statements directly contradict each other. step 3: based on the contradiction and the lack of logical connection between the premise and hypothesis, the hypothesis cannot be inferred from the premise.step 4: it's important to note that the lack of entailment does not necessarily mean that the hypothesis is false, but rather that it cannot be logically derived from the given premise alone."
1377,"On the contrary, it might be simpler for you to pass as an American.",Americans always pass easily. ,1,0,False,"step 1: in the premise, it is stated that 'it might be simpler for you to pass as an american.' this implies that there are circumstances under which it is easier for someone to be perceived as an american. the hypothesis, 'americans always pass easily,' makes a generalization about all americans. however, the premise does not provide enough information to support this broad claim. step 2: the hypothesis contradicts the premise, as the premise acknowledges that passing as an american can sometimes be easier, but it does not imply that americans always pass easily. step 3: based on the given information, the hypothesis cannot be logically inferred from the premise."
1378,A guy on a waterskiing board is doing a stunt.,The guy is watching tv.,0,0,True,"step 1. the premise describes a scenario where a guy is performing a stunt on a waterskiing board. this involves the guy being on or near water, engaged in an athletic activity. common sense and factual knowledge do not suggest any connection between this scenario and the hypothesis. step 2. the hypothesis, 'the guy is watching tv', is not logically related to or entailed by the premise, as there is no information in the premise that suggests the guy is watching tv. step 3. based on the lack of logical connection and the contradictory nature of the hypothesis to the given premise, the hypothesis cannot be inferred from the premise."
1379,A few blocks up Chatham Road South are two more major museums.,You won't be able to find any museums up Chatham Road South.,0,0,True,"step 1: in the premise, it is stated that there are two more museums located a few blocks up chatham road south. this implies that there are indeed museums along this road. step 2: the hypothesis contradicts the premise, as it asserts that there are no museums along chatham road south. contradictory hypotheses cannot be logically inferred from a premise. step 3: based on the logical reasoning and contradictory nature of the hypothesis, it is not entailed by the premise."
1380,"The issue of export controls on encryption technologies, or even the tax issue, is not broad-based enough, said Michael Cornfield, a professor at George Washington University's Graduate School of Political Management.",Cornfield is a political science professor at George Washington University.,1,1,True,"step 1: in the premise, michael cornfield is identified as a professor at george washington university's graduate school of political management. this is a clear statement of fact.step 2: the hypothesis also states that michael cornfield is a professor at george washington university, but it doesn't provide any new information that goes beyond the premise. the hypothesis is logically equivalent to the premise.step 3: since the hypothesis is logically identical to the premise, it can be inferred from the premise. the hypothesis is entailed by the premise."
1381,"But you will find it all right.""",You will find it lacking.,0,0,True,"step 1: in the premise, the speaker is expressing optimism and confidence that the listener will find or discover something. this implies a positive outcome.step 2: the hypothesis states the opposite of what is suggested in the premise. it implies a negative outcome.step 3: based on the logical negation of the premise's meaning, the hypothesis cannot be logically inferred from the premise.step 4: a contradictory statement, like the hypothesis, cannot be logically inferred from its contradictory statement, the premise.the hypothesis being a contradiction to the premise, there is no entailment relation."
1382,"Jim Moody born September 25, 1949 in Portsmouth, Virginia is a film character actor.","Jim Moody (born September 25, 1949 in Portsmouth, Virginia) is a television and film character actor.",1,1,True,"step 1. in the premise, jim moody is identified as a film character actor, born on a specific date and location. no information is given about him appearing only in films or television. step 2. the hypothesis states that jim moody is both a television and film character actor, which implies that the information in the hypothesis is already contained in the premise. this is because being a 'character actor' implies that jim moody appears in multiple roles across different types of media, including both television and film. step 3. based on the logical equivalence between the premise and hypothesis, and the fact that the hypothesis does not add any new information or contradict the premise, the hypothesis is entailed by the premise."
1383,"    IX   In the hours that followed, Dave's vague plans changed a dozen times as he found each idea unworkable.",Dave was very soon running out of ideas.,1,1,True,"step 1. in the premise, it is stated that dave's plans changed a dozen times due to their unworkability. this implies that dave was having a hard time coming up with effective plans. step 2. the hypothesis suggests that dave was running out of ideas. this is a logical conclusion from the premise since the repeated unworkability of dave's plans indicates a lack of new, viable ideas. step 3. based on the logical connection between the premise and hypothesis, and the absence of contradictory information, the hypothesis can be inferred from the premise."
1384,"If there is a cultural civil war going on, the Mediaphiles--led by Wall Street--have routed the 'phobes.",There are certainly no disagreements between members of different cultures.,0,0,True,"step 1: in the premise, it is stated that there is a cultural civil war and that the mediaphiles, led by wall street, have routed the 'phobes. this implies a state of conflict and victory for one side over the other. it does not provide any information about the existence or absence of disagreements between members of different cultures. step 2: the hypothesis states that 'there are certainly no disagreements between members of different cultures'. however, the premise does not logically entail this statement. in fact, it is contradictory to the premise, which indicates a state of conflict. step 3: based on the logical analysis, the hypothesis is not entailed by the premise."
1386,Many Israelis swear that these are the best steaks in the country.,Israelis do not know the country has steaks.,0,0,True,"step 1: in the premise, 'many israelis swear that these are the best steaks in the country' indicates a subjective opinion that many israelis hold about the quality of steaks in their country. it does not provide any information about the existence or non-existence of steaks in israel or their knowledge thereof.  step 2: the hypothesis 'israelis do not know the country has steaks' contradicts the premise, as it assumes the absence of knowledge about steaks in israel, which is not suggested by the premise. step 3: based on the given information, the hypothesis cannot be logically inferred from the premise as it contradicts it."
1387,One security manager thought that requiring such signed statements served as a useful technique for impressing on the users the importance of understanding organizational policies.,Signed statements for users have to be signed in order for them to continue.,1,0,False,"step 1: in the premise, the security manager expresses the belief that requiring signed statements from users is a useful technique for emphasizing the significance of organizational policies. no specific information is given about the necessity or effect of signing on the continuation of user access. step 2: the hypothesis introduces an additional requirement - that users must sign statements in order to continue. while this could be an implication of the security manager's belief, it is not explicitly stated in the premise. step 3: based on the given information, the hypothesis is not logically entailed by the premise. the premise focuses on the manager's belief in the importance of signed statements and their role in emphasizing policy understanding, while the hypothesis introduces a new requirement for continued access that is not directly related or mentioned in the premise."
1388,"As the Tokugawa shoguns had feared, this opening of the floodgates of Western culture after such prolonged isolation had a traumatic effect on Japanese society.","There was no traumatic effect on japanese society, when the floodgates of Western culture opened.",0,0,True,"step 1: in the premise, the tokugawa shoguns' fear is referenced in relation to the opening of the floodgates of western culture having a 'traumatic effect' on japanese society. this implies that the shoguns anticipated negative consequences from this cultural interaction. step 2: the hypothesis asserts the direct opposite of what is stated in the premise, suggesting no traumatic effect at all. step 3: given the historical context and common knowledge, it is unreasonable to infer that there was no traumatic effect based on the premise. the premise does not provide any information about the extent or duration of the traumatic effect, but it does indicate that there was one. the hypothesis contradicts the premise and cannot be logically inferred from it. step 4: based on the logical reasoning, the hypothesis is not entailed by the premise."
1389,The hordes of people who attended Hoover Dam's 1935 dedication set the city's now-formidable public relations machine into action.,Lots of people went to see the Hoover Dam's dedication because it was a controversial environmental topic.,1,0,False,"step 1. in the premise, it is mentioned that 'hordes of people' attended hoover dam's dedication. this implies a large number of people were present. no specific reason for their attendance is given in the premise. step 2. the hypothesis suggests that the people were drawn to the dedication because it was a 'controversial environmental topic'. however, there is no information in the premise that supports or contradicts this hypothesis. step 3. based on the given information, the hypothesis cannot be logically inferred from the premise as there is no mention of the dedication being a controversial environmental topic in the premise. thus, the hypothesis is not entailed by the premise."
1390,He makes a compelling case.,His argument was weak.,0,0,True,"step 1: making a compelling case implies that the speaker presents strong, persuasive, and logical reasons to support their argument. this does not directly contradict the hypothesis that his argument was weak, as these concepts are not mutually exclusive. however, it's important to note that a compelling case and a weak argument can coexist, such as when a speaker uses emotional appeals or persuasive language to hide a lack of logical or factual support.step 2: the hypothesis that 'his argument was weak' does not logically follow from the premise 'he makes a compelling case.' while making a compelling case is a strong speaking ability, it does not guarantee that the argument itself is logically sound or factually correct. the hypothesis introduces a new piece of information that contradicts the premise only if we assume that a compelling case is a necessary condition for a strong argument. however, this is not a logical necessity.step 3: based on the logical analysis and the given information, the hypothesis cannot be logically inferred from the premise."
1391,"Easily accessible from the Asian mainland via Korea, Kyushu has a longer history of significant contacts with foreigners than any other part of Japan.",Kyushu was the first and most utilized point of contact with Koreans.,1,1,True,"step 1: the premise establishes kyushu as a historically significant point of contact between japan and foreigners, particularly koreans. it implies that kyushu has had more extensive contact with koreans than any other region in japan. step 2: the hypothesis suggests that kyushu was the initial and primary point of contact between japan and koreans. given the information in the premise, it is logical to infer that the hypothesis is a reasonable explanation for the long and extensive history of contacts between kyushu and korea. step 3: based on the logical connection between the premise and hypothesis, and the lack of contradictory information, the hypothesis can be inferred from the premise."
1393,Another man held to the high horn with both hands and weaved back and forth while a comrade riding beside him strove to keep him from toppling to the ground.,The high horn required dexterity when wielded by even the most seasoned horn holder.,1,1,True,"step 1: in the premise, we have a description of a man holding onto a 'high horn' while another man tries to keep him from falling. the phrase 'wielded by even the most seasoned horn holder' in the hypothesis suggests that the handling of the high horn is a challenging task.  step 2: the hypothesis can be logically inferred from the premise because the premise indicates that holding the high horn requires a significant amount of effort and balance to avoid falling. this difficulty implies that dexterity is necessary to handle the high horn effectively. the premise does not contradict the hypothesis. step 3: based on the logical reasoning derived from the information in the premise, the hypothesis can be reasonably inferred from the premise."
1394,The album 's seven original tracks were recorded at various locations in the United States.,The album's seven original tracks were recorded at various locations in the United States and England.,1,1,True,"step 1. the premise states that the seven original tracks of an album were recorded at various locations in the united states. this implies that the recording process was not confined to a single location. step 2. the hypothesis extends the information in the premise by adding 'and england' as another possible country where recording took place. this extension is not contradictory to the premise, as it does not negate the statement that recording took place in the united states. step 3. the hypothesis can be seen as a more specific version of the premise, providing additional information without contradicting it. therefore, the hypothesis is a logical extension of the premise. step 4. logically, if all the original tracks were recorded in the us, then adding england as a location where recording took place does not negate that fact. in fact, it only adds to the information given in the premise. step 5. in summary, the hypothesis can be logically inferred from the premise since it does not contradict any part of the premise and provides additional information."
1396,"The top curve shows that if the Postal Service has 0 percent inefficiencies with its current wage premium, the measure of scale economies equal $6.",The postal service has an economic scale of $3.,0,0,True,"step 1. the premise establishes a relationship between the postal service's wage premium inefficiencies and the measure of scale economies. it indicates that if there are no inefficiencies, the scale economies amount to $6. step 2. the hypothesis introduces a different quantity, $3, as the measure of scale economies for the postal service. however, the hypothesis does not provide any context or relationship to the premise regarding the efficiency levels or inefficiencies. step 3. the hypothesis cannot be logically inferred from the premise as it introduces a new piece of information without providing a logical connection or context."
1397,"Since the rule was determined to be potentially economically significant,1 HUD prepared an Economic Analysis, which was also reviewed by OMB.","The economic impact of this particular rule would have come down on animal testing labs, which keep their costs lowered by not inflating the amount of animal testing regulations that are already present in the scientific field. ",1,0,False,"step 1: in the premise, it is stated that hud prepared an economic analysis for a potentially economically significant rule, which was also reviewed by omb. this suggests a regulatory process where economic considerations are taken into account before implementing a rule. the hypothesis introduces a new element about animal testing labs and their cost-saving strategies. step 2: the hypothesis does not directly contradict the premise. however, it introduces a new assumption about the nature of this particular rule and its impact on animal testing labs. there is no explicit information in the premise that supports or refutes this assumption. step 3: based on the available information, the hypothesis cannot be logically inferred from the premise. while it is possible that this rule could impact animal testing labs, the premise does not provide sufficient evidence to support this conclusion."
1398,"It is not an edifying spectacle; but no matter how base the motives of those involved, the result has been to move hundreds of millions of people from abject poverty to something still awful but nonetheless significantly better.",The result has not helped the poor people in any way.,0,0,True,"step 1: in the premise, it is stated that the result of certain actions has helped move hundreds of millions of people from poverty to something still awful but better. this implies that while the situation is not ideal, it represents an improvement. step 2: the hypothesis suggests that the result has not helped the poor people at all. this is a contradiction to the premise, as the premise states that the result has helped move people from poverty. step 3: based on the logical negation of the premise in the hypothesis, it is clear that the hypothesis cannot be logically inferred from the premise."
1399,A fifth season was announced on 6 June 2016.,A fifth season was announced on 6 June 2016 and began airing on 27 February 2017 and concluded on 1 May 2017 with 10 episodes.,1,0,False,"step 1. in the premise, it is stated that a fifth season was announced on 6 june 2016. this information does not include any details about the start or end dates of the season or the number of episodes. step 2. the hypothesis adds new information about the start date (27 february 2017), end date (1 may 2017), and the number of episodes (10) for the fifth season. step 3. the hypothesis cannot be logically inferred from the premise as it contains additional information not mentioned in the premise. the hypothesis makes assumptions about the start and end dates and the number of episodes, which are not indicated in the premise. step 4. the hypothesis contradicts the premise in its completeness, as the premise only states the announcement date, whereas the hypothesis includes details that are not stated in the premise. step 5. based on the logical reasoning, the hypothesis cannot be inferred from the premise."
1400,"However, they went away again.",They never arrived in the first place. ,0,0,True,"step 1: the premise describes an action where 'they' went away after an initial appearance. this does not provide sufficient information to determine if 'they' ever arrived in the first place. step 2: the hypothesis suggests the opposite of the premise, implying that 'they' did not arrive at all. step 3: although the hypothesis cannot be logically inferred directly from the premise due to the lack of sufficient information, it is not necessarily contradictory as there is no clear factual inconsistency between the two. however, it is important to note that the absence of evidence is not evidence of absence. therefore, based on the given information, we cannot definitively determine if the hypothesis is entailed by the premise or not."
1402,that was a good movie that that was one movie that uh i wasn't ready for it to be over with,I kept wishing that the movie would end; it was that bad.,0,0,True,"step 1: in the premise, the speaker expresses their disappointment that the movie ended, indicating a positive emotional response towards it. the use of the phrase 'wasn't ready for it to be over with' further emphasizes this. step 2: the hypothesis presents an opposite emotional response to the premise, stating that the person wished the movie would end but with a negative connotation. however, this contradicts the information given in the premise. step 3: the hypothesis cannot be logically inferred from the premise as the emotional responses expressed are contradictory.step 4: it is important to note that the given sentences are in the first person and are statements about the speaker's feelings, not objective facts. this adds a layer of complexity, as feelings and opinions are inherently subjective. however, based on the information provided, the hypothesis is not a logical inference from the premise."
1403,The S3 molecule is an allotrope of sulfur.,The S3 molecule or trisulfur or sulfur trimer or thiozone or triatomic sulfur is an allotrope of sulfur.,1,1,True,"step 1: in the premise, 'the s3 molecule is an allotrope of sulfur', 's3' is identified as a specific allotrope of sulfur. allotropes are different forms of a single element with distinct physical and chemical properties. no contradictory information is present.step 2: the hypothesis, 'the s3 molecule or trisulfur or sulfur trimer or thiozone or triatomic sulfur is an allotrope of sulfur', is equivalent to the premise as they both refer to 's3' as an allotrope of sulfur using different names. the hypothesis provides alternative names for the allotrope mentioned in the premise.step 3: given the equivalence between the premise and hypothesis, the hypothesis can be inferred from the premise as they express the same fact."
1404,A man with a white towel wrapped around the lower part of his face and neck.,The man is covering his neck,1,1,True,"step 1: the premise describes a man with a white towel covering the lower part of his face and neck. this information does not necessarily imply why the man is wearing the towel, but it is common sense that people often cover their necks to keep warm, protect from sun or wind, or hide their identity. step 2: the hypothesis suggests that the man is specifically covering his neck. this explanation is consistent with the premise as the towel is indeed wrapped around the lower part of his face and neck. step 3: based on the logical reasoning and common sense understanding, the hypothesis can be inferred from the premise as it does not contradict the given information."
1405,They think the Democrats must identify with the moral and economic concerns of a largely suburban middle class.,The Democrats have nothing to gain by identifying with the concerns of the middle class.,0,0,True,"step 1: the premise suggests that it is commonly believed or understood that the democrats need to address the moral and economic issues that resonate with the suburban middle class in order to be successful. step 2: the hypothesis, on the other hand, asserts that there is no benefit for the democrats in doing so. at first glance, these two statements seem contradictory. however, it's important to consider that the premise only indicates that it is a common belief that identifying with middle class concerns is necessary, not that it is an actual fact or a universally accepted truth. step 3: the hypothesis does not logically follow from the premise, as the premise only establishes a perceived need for the democrats to identify with middle class concerns, not an actual requirement or guarantee of success. thus, the hypothesis is not entailed by the premise."
1406,"[As the relationship between Clinton and Monica continues, some members of the White House staff become worried about the prudence of continuing the relationship with so much potential for scandal.",The White House staff is upset because the relationship between Clinton and Monica is getting stronger.,1,1,True,"step 1: in the premise, it is indicated that some white house staff members are worried about the clinton-monica relationship due to the potential for scandal. this implies a concern for the negative implications of the relationship for the white house. step 2: the hypothesis suggests that the white house staff is upset because the relationship is getting stronger, which is a reasonable inference based on the premise. if the relationship is indeed getting stronger, it could potentially escalate the scandal, reinforcing the staff's concerns. step 3: based on the logical connection between the premise and hypothesis, and the lack of contradictory information, the hypothesis can be inferred from the premise."
1408,"An organization's activities, core processes, and resources must be aligned to support its mission and help it achieve its goals.",A company's mission can be realized even without the alignment of resources.,0,0,True,"step 1: in the premise, the alignment of an organization's activities, core processes, and resources is stated as a necessary condition for supporting its mission and achieving its goals. this implies that these elements are interconnected and play crucial roles in the organization's success.step 2: the hypothesis suggests that a company's mission can be realized without the alignment of resources. this is a contradiction to the premise, as resources are a fundamental part of an organization, and their alignment is essential for achieving the mission and goals.step 3: based on the logical inconsistency between the premise and hypothesis, the hypothesis cannot be inferred from the premise.step 4: it is essential to note that the hypothesis could still be true for specific circumstances, such as short-term goals or situations where external factors compensate for the lack of resource alignment. however, the premise only discusses the general requirement for alignment, and it does not support the hypothesis under its current form."
1409,"The Jazz also beat the Los Angeles Lakers ' record of sixteen consecutive winning seasons, set between 1991–92.","The Jazz also beat the Los Angeles Lakers' record of sixteen consecutive winning seasons, set between 1976–77 and 1991–92.",0,1,False,"step 1: in the premise, it is stated that the jazz beat the los angeles lakers' record of sixteen consecutive winning seasons, which was set between 1991–92. the hypothesis proposes an extension of the premise, suggesting that the record was set between 1976–77 and 1991–92. step 2: the hypothesis does not contradict the premise, as it only extends the timeframe within which the record was set. the information in the hypothesis is consistent with the premise. step 3: since the hypothesis does not contradict the premise and provides additional information without altering the original meaning, it can be inferred from the premise as a more detailed or expanded version.step 4: it is worth noting that the hypothesis could only be inferred from the premise if the original premise did not specify the exact years, and the common knowledge or context suggests that the los angeles lakers held this record for a longer span than mentioned in the premise.therefore, the hypothesis can be inferred from the premise, as it provides a more comprehensive description of the same fact."
1410,that's why they say always say it's like five degrees warmer in the city at night time than out in the country,The countryside is a lot hotter and we should not go there.,0,0,True,"step 1: in the premise, it is stated that the city is five degrees warmer at night time compared to the countryside. this information implies a temperature difference between the two locations, with the city being warmer. step 2: the hypothesis, however, suggests the opposite, stating that the countryside is 'a lot hotter'. the hypothesis contradicts the information given in the premise. step 3: based on the logical inconsistency between the premise and hypothesis, there is no entailment relationship between them. the hypothesis cannot be logically inferred from the premise."
1411,okay sounds good was nice talking to you bye-bye,The plan you made sounds good.,1,1,True,"step 1: in this example, both the premise and hypothesis are statements expressing approval or agreement regarding a plan. no new information is introduced in the hypothesis that is not already present in the premise.step 2: the hypothesis can be logically inferred from the premise because the approval expressed in the premise implies that the plan is sound and good, and the hypothesis simply reaffirms this point.step 3: based on the logical similarity between the premise and hypothesis, and the lack of contradictory information, the hypothesis can be inferred from the premise.step 4: however, it is important to note that the logical entailment here is quite weak, as the hypothesis does not add any new information or consequences to the premise."
1412,so that's helping,That isn't helping.,0,0,True,"step 1: in the premise, there is an indicative conditional 'so that's helping', suggesting a reason or consequence. however, the premise itself does not contain any specific actions or events that can be directly linked to the hypothesis. the hypothesis, 'that isn't helping', does not relate to the given context. it is a simple negative statement.step 2: the hypothesis 'that isn't helping' does not logically follow from the premise 'so that's helping'. the premise describes a situation where something is helping, but the hypothesis contradicts this by stating that it isn't helping.step 3: based on the logical analysis, the hypothesis 'that isn't helping' cannot be inferred from the premise 'so that's helping'."
1414,"And, I did not paint a horrific picture of the future, just so you might think the present PRC recommendation ain't so bad, after all.",I painted a terrible picture of the future because I wanted you to realize that the PRC's recommendation isn't that bad.,0,0,True,"step 1: in the premise, the speaker acknowledges that they did not paint a 'horrific picture' of the future but did so to make the audience consider the prc's recommendation in a more favorable light. this implies that the speaker might have intentionally exaggerated the negatives to create a contrast and emphasize the goodness of the prc's recommendation. step 2: the hypothesis proposes that the speaker painted a 'terrible picture' of the future not to scare or discourage, but to make the audience appreciate the prc's recommendation. while the hypothesis has a similar effect as the premise, the way they are phrased makes them seem slightly different. however, based on the information provided, there is no clear contradiction or logical inconsistency between the two statements. step 3: the hypothesis is not a logical entailment of the premise, as they express slightly different ideas, but they are related and can be considered interchangeable in certain contexts. the speaker's intention to highlight the prc's recommendation in a positive light is a common thread between the two. ultimately, while the hypothesis can't be directly inferred from the premise, they convey similar meanings, and the hypothesis is not a contradiction or a false statement."
1415,"That all the welcoming would be on the other side, breaking right through the barrier he had been building for years?",He had built his walls for years because of the isolation he had suffered.,1,1,True,"step 1: in the premise, the speaker is expressing surprise about finding welcoming people on the other side of a barrier they had been building for years. the barrier is something they had been constructing for a long time, presumably to keep people or situations out. step 2: the hypothesis suggests a potential reason for the barrier's existence: the person had been suffering from isolation. this reason is not explicitly stated in the premise but is a common cause of people building physical or emotional barriers. step 3: although the premise does not directly entail the hypothesis, it does not contradict it either. the speaker's surprise at finding welcoming people on the other side implies that they had expected something different, which could have been a continuation of their isolation. the hypothesis is a plausible explanation for the premise, as isolation is a common reason for people to build barriers. step 4: given the lack of contradiction and the plausibility of the hypothesis based on common sense, it can be considered entailed, though indirectly.step 5: it is important to note that this analysis assumes that the speaker in the premise and the person building the walls in the hypothesis are the same. if they are different, then the hypothesis cannot be directly inferred from the premise."
1416,that's the jumbo shrimp in the shells leave the shells on them so they won't just roll up,Jumbo shrimp rolls up when you cook them for more than 20 minutes.,1,0,False,"step 1. the premise describes a characteristic behavior of jumbo shrimp, which is leaving the shells on to prevent them from rolling up. this suggests that there is a problem with the shrimp rolling up when not in the shells. step 2. the hypothesis states that jumbo shrimp rolls up when cooked for more than 20 minutes. this is an unrelated statement about the behavior of jumbo shrimp when cooked. in the premise, there is no indication that the shrimp are being cooked or that the rolling up behavior is related to cooking. step 3. based on the given information, the hypothesis cannot be logically inferred from the premise as they describe distinct and unrelated phenomena."
1417,That is all right for now.,Leaving it there is ok for now.,1,1,True,"step 1: in the premise, 'that is all right for now', the speaker acknowledges that the current state or situation is acceptable for the time being. the term 'all right' implies that there are no significant issues or problems. step 2: the hypothesis, 'leaving it there is ok for now', carries the same implication as the premise. it suggests that leaving something in its current position is acceptable and does not pose any major issues. step 3: both sentences express the idea that the current state or situation is acceptable for the time being. the hypothesis is a logical inference from the premise because it maintains the same meaning and implication.step 4: the hypothesis is a specific instance of the more general premise, as 'leaving it there' is a form of 'doing nothing' or 'keeping things as they are', which is included in the meaning of 'it is all right for now'.step 5: common sense reasoning also supports the inference, as leaving something alone that is currently acceptable does not contradict the premise.therefore, based on logical reasoning, common sense, and the lack of contradictory information, the hypothesis can be inferred from the premise."
1418,Teen-age girls are taking them to improve performance and win college athletic scholarships.,The teen age girls are taking steroids to improve their performance. ,1,0,False,"step 1: in the premise, it is stated that teen-age girls are taking something to improve their performance and win college athletic scholarships. this implies an action they are taking to gain a competitive edge. however, the premise does not provide any specific information about what they are taking. common sense suggests that there could be various explanations for this behavior, including legal methods such as rigorous training or practicing more often. step 2: the hypothesis suggests that the teenage girls are taking steroids. steroids are a type of performance-enhancing drugs that can significantly improve athletic performance. however, the premise does not directly support this hypothesis as it does not mention steroids or any other specific drugs. step 3: based on the given information, the hypothesis cannot be logically inferred from the premise as the premise does not specify that the girls are taking steroids or any other illegal performance-enhancing substances. the premise only implies that they are taking something to improve their performance."
1419,(Thank God we weren't editing encyclopedias at Microsoft!),Editing encyclopedias is a nightmare. ,1,1,True,"step 1: in the premise, there is an expression of relief that editing encyclopedias was not a task at microsoft. this implies that editing encyclopedias is a challenging or difficult process. step 2: the hypothesis states that editing encyclopedias is a 'nightmare.' a nightmare typically implies a particularly difficult or stressful experience. step 3: given the meaning of the words 'nightmare' and 'difficult' or 'challenging', and the implication of the premise, it is a logical inference that editing encyclopedias is difficult or challenging, as stated in the hypothesis. therefore, the hypothesis is entailed by the premise.step 4: it is essential to note that the premise does not explicitly state that microsoft editing encyclopedias would have been a nightmare, but only implies it. however, given the common meaning and usage of the expression 'thank god we weren't doing x' (where x is the unpleasant task), it can be reasonably assumed that the speaker would have used the term 'nightmare' if they had experienced it firsthand or knew that it was a genuinely terrible experience.step 5: in summary, the hypothesis can be logically inferred from the premise because the hypothesis describes a logical consequence of the premise and is consistent with the common meaning and usage of the language in the premise."
1420,Every additional copy of Windows 95 costs Microsoft ...,Microsoft never put out a OS called Windows 95.,0,0,True,"step 1: in the premise, 'every additional copy of windows 95 costs microsoft' suggests that microsoft incurs an expense for each sold copy of windows 95. this statement does not provide any information about the existence or non-existence of windows 95.step 2: the hypothesis, 'microsoft never put out a os called windows 95', contradicts the premise as windows 95 is mentioned in the premise. the hypothesis is not logically inferable from the premise.step 3: based on the given information, the hypothesis is not entailed by the premise."
1421,"It might be a 'she,'  I suggested. ","It might be a young lady, not a boy, I suggested.",1,0,False,"step 1: the premise indicates that you suggested a possible gender for 'it,' which is 'she.' no specific information is given about the age or gender of the person you were referring to. common sense and logical principles do not prevent 'it' from being a young lady. step 2: the hypothesis, 'it might be a young lady,' is consistent with the premise because both statements suggest possible genders for 'it.' there is no contradiction between the two sentences. the hypothesis does not necessarily follow logically from the premise, but it is not in contradiction either. step 3: based on the absence of contradiction and the logical consistency between the premise and hypothesis, there is no entailment or contradiction relationship between the two."
1422,process one out of every four checks in the country.,The country's checks are never processed. ,0,0,True,"step 1: in the premise, it is stated that 'one out of every four checks in the country' is processed. this implies that checks are being processed in the country. step 2: the hypothesis, 'the country's checks are never processed,' contradicts the premise, as the premise indicates that some checks are processed in the country. step 3: based on the logical negation of the premise and the contradictory nature of the hypothesis, the hypothesis is not entailed by the premise."
1423,you want to have that coverage so anyway uh but what else,No press is bad press,1,0,False,"step 1: the premise does not provide enough information to make a definitive conclusion about the relationship between 'wanting coverage' and the hypothesis 'no press is bad press'. 'wanting coverage' could be interpreted as desiring positive publicity, neutral coverage, or even acknowledging the truth of 'no press is bad press'. common sense suggests that wanting coverage and accepting 'no press is bad press' as true are not directly related. step 2: the hypothesis 'no press is bad press' is not logically inferred from the premise, as the premise does not establish a connection between the two statements. step 3: based on the lack of logical connection and the ambiguous nature of the premise, the hypothesis 'no press is bad press' cannot be logically inferred from the premise."
1424,The review identified errors and their causes and provided IDPA with information that allowed it to focus attention on the 5 percent of inaccurate payments and target strategies to improve the accuracy of these payments.,The review found errors in the payment system.,1,1,True,"step 1: in the premise, it is stated that the review identified errors and their causes. this implies that there were indeed errors present in the system. the review also provided information that allowed idpa to focus on inaccurate payments, indicating that these errors were related to the payment system. step 2: the hypothesis is consistent with the information in the premise, as it also states that errors were found in the payment system. the hypothesis is a specific instance of the broader scenario outlined in the premise. step 3: based on the logical relationship between the premise and hypothesis, and the lack of contradictory information, the hypothesis can be inferred from the premise."
1425,"Well, that was flat.",It had tall ridges.  ,0,0,True,"step 1: the premise describes something as being 'flat'. this means having no height or slope. no explicit information about the presence or absence of ridges is given in the premise. step 2: the hypothesis states that 'it had tall ridges'. this is a clear contradiction to the premise, as tall ridges would imply height, which is the opposite of 'flat'. step 3: based on the logical negation of the premise and the contradiction of the hypothesis to the premise, it is clear that the hypothesis cannot be logically inferred from the premise."
1426,"Dean Bridge carries the main road over the Water; it was designed and built by Thomas Telford, one of Scotland's greatest civil engineers.","While well designed originally, the bridge has fallen into disrepair. ",1,0,False,"step 1: the premise describes dean bridge as the main road over the water, designed and built by thomas telford. this information does not directly imply any current state of the bridge. common sense and historical records suggest that well-designed structures can deteriorate over time due to natural wear and tear, weather conditions, or lack of maintenance. no information in the premise contradicts this hypothesis.step 2: the hypothesis does not logically contradict the premise, as the premise does not provide any information about the current state of the bridge. however, the hypothesis can be inferred as a separate piece of information that might be true or false independently of the premise.step 3: based on the lack of contradiction and the general understanding that structures can deteriorate, the hypothesis is not logically entailed by the premise but could still be a valid statement.step 4: it is important to note that the hypothesis may not be true in every case, as the actual condition of dean bridge is not mentioned in the premise. the hypothesis should be evaluated based on additional information, such as historical records, news articles, or firsthand observations."
1428,"Made possible by its conquests, elegant Palladian villas grace the Veneto mainland from Venice to Padua and Vicenza.","There are only a few elegant Palladian villas, the rest are of much lower quality.",1,0,False,"step 1: the premise describes the existence and location of elegant palladian villas in the veneto mainland. it does not provide any information about the number of these villas or their quality. step 2: the hypothesis makes a claim about the number and quality of palladian villas. it asserts that while some are elegant, others are of much lower quality. the hypothesis does not contradict the premise, but it goes beyond the information provided, so it cannot be logically inferred from the premise. step 3: based on the given information, the hypothesis is not entailed by the premise."
1429,The judge determined that Moore had violated California's Unfair Business Practices and False Advertising Laws.,Moore followed California's Unfair Business Practices and False Advertising Laws.,0,0,True,"step 1: in the premise, it is stated that the judge found moore to have violated california's unfair business practices and false advertising laws. this means that moore's actions were not in accordance with these laws.step 2: the hypothesis suggests that moore had followed california's unfair business practices and false advertising laws. however, given the information from the premise, this is a contradiction, not a logical inference.step 3: based on the logical reasoning and the given information, the hypothesis 'moore followed california's unfair business practices and false advertising laws' is not entailed by the premise 'the judge determined that moore had violated california's unfair business practices and false advertising laws'."
1430,A young women dips her feet into a natural spring in an outdoor setting.,A woman is outside touching water.,1,1,True,"step 1: in the premise, a young woman is described as dipping her feet into a natural spring, which is an outdoor setting. the key information here is that a woman is performing an action (dipping her feet) in an outdoor environment and the object of her action is water.step 2: in the hypothesis, a woman is described as being outside and touching water. this hypothesis can be logically inferred from the premise because the premise already implies the woman is outside and the action she is performing involves touching water.step 3: based on the logical connection between the premise and hypothesis, and the lack of contradictory information, the hypothesis can be inferred from the premise."
1431,so i guess my experience is is just with what we did and and so they didn't really go through the child care route they were able to be home together,They weren't able to be home with their child and ended up getting childcare instead.,0,0,True,"step 1: in the premise, the speakers describe their personal situation where they didn't follow the childcare route and were able to be home together with their child. they do not mention any information about getting childcare. step 2: the hypothesis suggests a contradictory situation where the speakers weren't able to be home with their child and got childcare instead. however, the premise does not logically imply or entail this hypothesis. step 3: based on the given information, there is no logical connection between the premise and the hypothesis. the hypothesis is not a reasonable inference from the premise."
1432,"Last year, Arafat cracked down on Hamas after a string of bombings in Tel Aviv and Jerusalem, arresting more than 1,200 suspected terrorists, destroying Hamas safe houses, and confiscating its weapons caches.",Arafat later released 500 of the suspected terrorists.,1,0,False,"step 1: in the premise, we have a description of actions taken by arafat against hamas following a series of bombings. these actions include arresting over a thousand suspected terrorists, destroying hamas safe houses, and confiscating their weapons caches. the hypothesis suggests that arafat later released 500 of these suspects.step 2: the hypothesis does not directly contradict the premise, as the premise does not mention or indicate that all the arrested suspects were kept in detention without release. it is a common occurrence for suspects to be released during or after an investigation, especially when there is insufficient evidence to hold them. this is a logical possibility given the information in the premise.step 3: based on the logical reasoning, the hypothesis is not directly entailed by the premise, as the premise does not exclude the possibility of the release of some suspects. the hypothesis is a plausible but distinct outcome that could follow from the initial actions described in the premise."
1433,"Ruta graveolens, commonly known as rue, common herb - of - grace, is a species of "" Ruta "" grown as an ornamental plant and herb.","Ruta graveolens, commonly known as rue, common rue or herb-of-grace, is a species of ""Ruta"" grown as an ornamental plant and herb.",1,1,True,"step 1: both the premise and hypothesis describe the same plant species, ruta graveolens, and the common names used for it: 'rue', 'common rue', 'herb-of-grace'. the premise also mentions that this plant is grown as an ornamental plant and herb. step 2: the hypothesis is identical to the premise in all significant aspects, making it a logical inference. the hypothesis does not contradict or provide new information that is not already present in the premise. step 3: based on the logical equivalence between the premise and hypothesis, and the absence of contradictory information, the hypothesis is entailed by the premise."
1434,You can give me milk and spinach.,You will give me milk and spinach or else.,0,0,True,"step 1: in the premise, it is stated that you can give me milk and spinach. this suggests that you have the ability and the resources to provide me with both milk and spinach. it does not impose any conditions or implications about why or under what circumstances you would provide these items.step 2: in the hypothesis, it is stated that i will give you milk and spinach or else. this is a completely different statement from the premise, suggesting a demand or a condition, rather than an ability or an offer. there is no logical connection between the premise and the hypothesis based on the information provided.step 3: the hypothesis cannot be logically inferred from the premise, as they express different statements with different meanings.step 4: based on the logical analysis, the hypothesis is not entailed by the premise."
1435,"In late spring, the hillsides are awash with flowers, and crops such as corn give the fields a golden hue.",There are so many plants there in the spring. ,1,1,True,"step 1: in the premise, it is mentioned that 'the hillsides are awash with flowers' and 'crops such as corn give the fields a golden hue'. this implies a large number of plants present, as both flowers and crops are types of plants. the description of the hillsides being 'awash' with flowers signifies a dense growth of flowers, further emphasizing the large number of plants. common sense also supports this, as spring is typically a time when many plants bloom and grow. step 2: the hypothesis 'there are so many plants there in the spring' can be logically inferred from the premise as it is an accurate and necessary conclusion from the information provided. step 3: based on the logical reasoning, common sense, and the consistent information presented in the premise, the hypothesis can be inferred from the premise."
1436,"It would be hard to spot one among three million, anyhow.",It would not take any effort to spot one.,0,0,True,"step 1: in the premise, the statement 'it would be hard to spot one' implies that finding the specific item among three million candidates is a challenging task. this information does not provide any context about the nature or identity of the item. step 2: the hypothesis 'it would not take any effort to spot one' contradicts the premise as it suggests that finding the item is easy. there is no logical or factual connection between the premise and hypothesis based on the information provided. step 3: the hypothesis cannot be logically inferred from the premise as they are contradictory."
1437,"In particular, the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1995 emphasized the need for agencies to acquire and apply information resources to effectively support the accomplishment of agency missions and the delivery of services to the public.",Agencies do not need to apply information resources.,0,0,True,"step 1: the premise highlights the importance of information resources for agencies to accomplish their missions and deliver services to the public. it does not state or imply that the use of information resources is optional or unnecessary. step 2: the hypothesis directly contradicts the premise by suggesting that agencies do not need to apply information resources. given the clear statement in the premise about the necessity of information resources, it is not possible to logically infer the hypothesis from the premise. step 3: based on the logical inconsistency between the premise and hypothesis, the hypothesis cannot be inferred from the premise."
1438,"'We can't find him, Benjamin,' Lincoln/Natalia said.",Lincoln/Natalia and Benjamin found him quite easily.,0,0,True,"step 1: in the premise, 'we can't find him, benjamin,' indicates that lincoln or natalia (the speakers) are having difficulty locating a person named benjamin. this is an assertion of inability. step 2: the hypothesis, 'lincoln/natalia and benjamin found him quite easily,' suggests that they not only found benjamin but did so without much effort. this contradicts the premise. step 3: based on the logical contradiction and the lack of any information in the premise that would allow for the inference of the hypothesis, the hypothesis cannot be logically inferred from the premise."
1439,This has presented design difficulties and has resulted in costly equipment.,The design difficulties could have been avoided through proper planning.,1,1,True,"step 1: in the premise, 'this' refers to a specific design or project that has faced challenges and incurred significant costs. the cause of these difficulties and costs is not explicitly stated but can be inferred to be related to the design or planning process. step 2: the hypothesis suggests that proper planning could have prevented these design difficulties. this implies that the root cause of the difficulties was a lack or failure of planning. step 3: given the information from the premise and the logical relationship established in the hypothesis, it is reasonable to infer that if proper planning had been in place, the design difficulties and subsequent equipment costs could have been avoided. this is a classic example of 'hindsight is 20/20' reasoning, where we look back at a situation and see a clear solution or cause that was not apparent at the time. step 4: it is important to note that while the hypothesis is logically consistent with the premise, it does not directly follow from it, as the premise does not explicitly state a lack of planning as the cause of the difficulties. however, given the common sense understanding of design projects and the information provided, the hypothesis is a plausible explanation and therefore can be considered entailed by the premise in a broader, common sense interpretation.step 5: in summary, based on the logical relationship established in the hypothesis, the common sense understanding of design projects, and the lack of contradictory information in the premise, the hypothesis is a plausible explanation for the design difficulties described in the premise."
1441,yeah but uh i'm i i think that you know i mean we always uh i mean i've i've had a a lot of good experiences with uh with many many people especially where they've had uh extended family and i and and i i kind of see that that you know perhaps you know we may need to like get close to the family environment and and get down to the values of you know i mean uh it's,Yeah but many people like spending many months with their extended family,1,1,True,"step 1: the premise expresses the speaker's observation of having had good experiences with many people, especially those in extended family environments. the speaker suggests that getting close to such family environments and understanding their values is necessary. step 2: the hypothesis also talks about people spending significant time with their extended families. this is a logical implication of the premise, as the speaker's good experiences with extended family environments suggests that many people value and enjoy spending extended periods of time in those environments. step 3: based on the logical connection between the premise and hypothesis, and the lack of contradictory information, the hypothesis can be inferred from the premise."
1442,Malone was selected for the 2002 NBA All - Star Game.,"Malone was selected for the 2002 NBA All-Star Game, but did not play due to an injury.",1,0,False,"step 1: the premise states that malone was selected for the 2002 nba all-star game, which means he was chosen to participate in the event. this information does not provide any details about his actual attendance or participation. step 2: the hypothesis adds the condition that malone did not play due to an injury, which is not directly contradictory to the premise. however, it alters the meaning of the original statement by implying that malone's selection did not result in his actual participation in the game. step 3: to determine if the hypothesis can be logically inferred from the premise, we need to consider the additional information in the hypothesis. an injury is a common reason for not participating in a sports event, and it does not contradict the fact of being selected. however, the premise does not provide any information about malone's injury or his condition during the all-star game. therefore, while the hypothesis is not a direct contradiction of the premise, it cannot be logically inferred from the premise alone. step 4: the hypothesis requires additional information that is not provided in the premise, such as the details about malone's injury and his condition during the all-star game."
1444,India has always been a melange of peoples.,India has never been composed of multiple ethnicities.,0,0,True,"step 1: in the premise, 'india has always been a melange of peoples' suggests a mixture or blend of various ethnic groups within india. this implies the existence of multiple ethnicities in india. step 2: the hypothesis, 'india has never been composed of multiple ethnicities' contradicts the premise as it implies the absence of multiple ethnicities in india. step 3: based on the information provided, the hypothesis is not logically entailed by the premise. in fact, the premise directly contradicts the hypothesis."
1445,I know it's the fashion to run down the police.,Running down the police is out of style these days.,0,0,True,"step 1: in the premise, it is stated that it is fashionable to run down the police. running down something means criticizing or belittling it. in this context, it implies that expressing negative opinions about the police is popular or trendy. step 2: the hypothesis suggests the opposite: running down the police is out of style. out of style means no longer popular or trendy. step 3: the hypothesis contradicts the premise, as it claims something that is directly opposed to what the premise states. however, it's important to note that a contradiction does not necessarily mean that there is no entailment relationship. in order to determine if there is no entailment, we need to consider the context and the underlying assumptions. step 4: it's reasonable to assume that fashion trends change over time. while running down the police might have been fashionable at the time the premise was written, it's possible that public opinion has shifted since then. this could explain why the hypothesis is not logically entailed by the premise. step 5: based on the given information and common sense reasoning, there is no entailment relationship between the premise and hypothesis."
1446,"Originally a traveling group, the company has found a permanent home in Keswick.",The group passed through Keswick within one week.,0,1,False,"step 1: in the premise, the company is described as a traveling group that has now found a permanent home in keswick. this implies that the company had a history of traveling before settling in keswick. the hypothesis suggests that the group (presumably the same company) passed through keswick within one week.step 2: the hypothesis is consistent with the premise, as the premise does not specify an exact time when the company arrived in keswick or when it had stopped traveling. the company could have passed through keswick before settling there.step 3: based on the given information, the hypothesis can be reasonably inferred from the premise, as the premise does not contradict the hypothesis and the hypothesis is logically possible given the information in the premise."
1447,"Other than the snippets of concert footage and a few curious glimpses, it's a mishmash of drug-addled camera confusion.",The video was made worse by abhorrent and jarring editing.,1,1,True,"step 1: in the premise, the phrase 'mishmash of drug-addled camera confusion' suggests that the video is disorganized and hard to follow due to the camera work. this implies that there may be issues with the editing of the video. step 2: the hypothesis, 'the video was made worse by abhorrent and jarring editing,' directly relates to the premise, as it also points to issues with the editing of the video. based on the information provided in the premise, the hypothesis is a reasonable inference. step 3: given the information in the premise and the logical connection between the premise and hypothesis, the hypothesis can be inferred from the premise."
1448,"Lopez previously conceived plans for a greatest hits album in 2009, opted to use the material recorded for her seventh studio album, "" Love ?","Lopez previously conceived plans for a greatest hits album in 2009, but instead opted to use the material recorded for her seventh studio album, ""Love?",1,1,True,"step 1: both the premise and hypothesis mention lopez's plans for a greatest hits album in 2009. the premise also states that she ended up using the material recorded for her seventh studio album, 'love?' instead. no contradictory information is provided.step 2: the hypothesis does not contradict the premise but rather adds additional information about lopez's ultimate decision. given that both statements refer to the same event - planning for a greatest hits album in 2009 - the hypothesis can be considered a more specific or detailed version of the premise.step 3: based on the provided information, the hypothesis can be reasonably inferred from the premise since it does not contradict it and offers additional, relevant details."
1449,"The classic OPEN sign is a 35-inch by 15-inch rectangle, with a dozen feet of 12-millimeter tube in the word OPEN and another 8 feet in the border.",They were all made in the same factory.,1,0,False,"step 1. in the premise, we have measurements and materials used for making the open sign. no specific information is given about the location or manufacturer of the sign. however, the hypothesis makes a claim about all the signs being made in the same factory.step 2. the hypothesis does not follow logically from the premise as there is no information in the premise that connects the signs made with the same dimensions and materials to being produced in the same factory. thus, the hypothesis cannot be inferred from the premise based on the given information alone.step 3. the hypothesis being 'made in the same factory' is an additional fact that is not indicated in the premise, and it requires independent verification or evidence to be considered true. without such evidence, the hypothesis cannot be entailed by the premise."
1450,"Results of the review should be communicated to agency officials for their comment, in accordance with government auditing standards.",Agency officials are typically all ears when it comes to audit results.,1,0,False,"step 1: the premise states that the results of a review should be communicated to agency officials for their comment, implying that they have a role in the review process. this is in line with government auditing standards. there is no information provided about the attitude or behavior of the agency officials towards the audit results.step 2: the hypothesis 'agency officials are typically all ears when it comes to audit results' is not logically entailed by the premise as the premise does not provide any information about the attitude or behavior of the agency officials.step 3: based on the given information, the hypothesis cannot be logically inferred from the premise."
1451,"Ephesus, 17 km (101.2 miles) inland from Kuradase, is one of the best-preserved and most visited of Turkey's ancient cities.",Kuradase is one of Turkey's most visited and popular cities.,0,0,True,"step 1. in the premise, ephesus is described as one of the best-preserved and most visited ancient cities in turkey, located 17 km (101.2 miles) inland from kuradase. step 2. the hypothesis suggests that kuradase is one of the most visited and popular cities in turkey. step 3. while the premise does not directly state that kuradase is a visited or popular city, it does indicate a significant connection between kuradase and a popular destination (ephesus). it is a reasonable assumption that a city with a popular ancient site or attraction nearby would also experience increased visitation. therefore, the hypothesis can be considered a possible inference from the premise, but it is not a logical entailment. step 4. however, without further context or information, it's impossible to definitively say that the hypothesis is true. thus, the hypothesis cannot be logically inferred from the premise with certainty, but it may be suggestive or likely based on the given information."
1452,"Reachable only by boat until recently, they are linked by a network of ancient cliffside mule paths that provide some of Italy's loveliest treks.","It is still only accessible by boat, and the volcano devastated the island.",0,0,True,"step 1: the premise describes a location that was previously only accessible by boat but is now linked by ancient paths. this information does not necessarily imply that the location is currently only accessible by boat. common sense and logical understanding suggest that the existence of the ancient paths could make the location accessible by foot as well. there is no information in the premise that contradicts this possibility. step 2: the hypothesis states that the location is still only accessible by boat and that a volcano has devastated the island. this hypothesis contradicts the information in the premise about the ancient paths. step 3: based on the logical and factual inconsistency between the premise and hypothesis, it cannot be inferred that the hypothesis is entailed by the premise.step 4: it is important to note that the hypothesis itself could be true or false, independent of the premise. the premise only provides information about the past accessibility of the location and does not address its current accessibility or any volcanic activity that may have occurred."
1453,"While obviously constrained by their bondage, blacks nonetheless forged a culture rich with religious observances, folk tales, family traditions, song, and so on.",They do not hold trad ions as a highly valued thing. ,0,0,True,"step 1: in the premise, it is stated that 'blacks' have a culture rich with various aspects including religious observances, folk tales, family traditions, and song. this implies that traditions are indeed valued and held in high regard within this community. step 2: the hypothesis states that they 'do not hold traditions as a highly valued thing'. this directly contradicts the information provided in the premise, as it suggests that traditions are not valued, whereas the premise explicitly states that they do have a rich cultural tradition. step 3: based on the logical contradiction between the premise and hypothesis, the hypothesis cannot be inferred from the premise.step 4: it's essential to note that the given premise and hypothesis are not logically equivalent. the premise describes a culture with various traditions, while the hypothesis denies the importance of traditions within that culture. these statements convey different meanings and, as a result, the hypothesis cannot be logically derived from the premise."
1455,The difference now is that the company has finally figured out how to make its more unorthodox tactics pay off on the bottom line.,The company figured out how to get a profit off of their strange product.,1,1,True,"step 1: in the premise, it is stated that the company has found a way to make its unorthodox tactics profitable. this implies that the company was previously using unconventional methods, but they were not successful in generating profits. the mention of 'bottom line' indicates financial profit.step 2: the hypothesis is consistent with the premise as it suggests that the company has found a way to make a profit from a strange or unusual product. the premise and hypothesis describe similar scenarios, with the hypothesis being a specific case of the more general situation described in the premise.step 3: based on the logical connection between the premise and hypothesis, common sense reasoning, and the lack of contradictory information, the hypothesis can be inferred from the premise."
1456,"On the other hand, it's also possible that the tax incentives would miraculously repay the federal coffers many fold.",There will be no tax incentives.,0,0,True,"step 1: in the premise, there is a discussion about the possibility that tax incentives may or may not repay the federal coffers many fold. this implies that there are tax incentives in existence or being considered. the hypothesis, however, states that there will be no tax incentives.step 2: the hypothesis contradicts the premise as it suggests the absence of tax incentives, whereas the premise implies their presence or potential presence. contradictory hypotheses cannot be logically inferred from their contradictory premises.step 3: based on the logical analysis, the hypothesis is not entailed by the premise, as it contradicts the information provided."
1457,"I do not think, monsieur, said Poirot pointedly, ""that you quite realize how terrible it may be ”for you."" And as Inglethorp did not appear to understand, he added: ""Mr. Inglethorp, you are standing in very grave danger."" The two detectives fidgeted. ",Poirot told Mr. Inglethorp that she was completely safe.,0,0,True,"step 1: the premise indicates that poirot warned mr. inglethorp of a grave danger that he did not seem to understand. this implies that poirot believed mr. inglethorp was in danger and was trying to convey this to him.step 2: the hypothesis directly contradicts the premise. if poirot had told mr. inglethorp that he was completely safe, then there would be no reason for poirot's warning and the need for the two detectives to fidget.step 3: based on the information provided in the premise and the logical principle that contradictory statements cannot both be true, the hypothesis is not entailed by the premise."
1458,They've got to take care of the animals.,They have to take care of themselves.,0,0,True,"step 1: the premise indicates that 'they' have a responsibility to take care of 'animals'. 'animals' can refer to pets or other living creatures. this is a statement of an obligation or duty. step 2: the hypothesis, on the other hand, states that 'they' have to take care of 'themselves'. this is a different subject from the animals mentioned in the premise. step 3: while the premise and hypothesis have common wording ('they have to take care of'), the subjects and meanings are distinct. the hypothesis cannot be logically inferred from the premise as written. step 4: it is possible that the premise and hypothesis are related in a broader context, but without additional information, no logical entailment can be determined."
1459,"In the event that the selfinspection process does reveal problems, grantees are asked to consult with LSC to determine the appropriate corrective action.",You are not required to consult with eh LSC if there are problems.,1,0,False,"step 1: in the premise, it is stated that grantees are asked to consult with lsc if problems are revealed during the self-inspection process. this indicates a requirement or condition for grantees to consult with lsc when issues are found. step 2: the hypothesis states that there is no requirement for consulting with lsc when problems are identified. this directly contradicts the premise, as the hypothesis suggests the absence of a condition that is explicitly stated to be present in the premise. step 3: based on the logical analysis, the hypothesis is not entailed by the premise, as it negates a condition explicitly stated in the premise."
1461,"In any event, Clinton is now reversing the interdiction cuts.","Clinton is now reversing the interdiction cuts, much to everyone's dismay.",1,0,False,"step 1: the premise states that clinton is now reversing the interdiction cuts. it does not provide any additional information about the emotions or reactions of others. step 2: the hypothesis adds that this reversal is 'much to everyone's dismay.' this implies that there is a negative reaction to clinton's decision to reverse the interdiction cuts. step 3: the hypothesis does not contradict the premise but rather adds an additional detail about the emotional reaction. as the premise does not provide this detail, it cannot be logically inferred from the premise alone. step 4: in order to infer the hypothesis from the premise, we would need additional information indicating a universal negative reaction to clinton's decision. without this information, the hypothesis cannot be logically inferred from the premise."
1462,no it uh it started leaking through the you know out through the pan and out onto the floor and it's soaking up in the Sheetrock or in things right,It is not leaking out of the pan.,0,0,True,"step 1: in the premise, a leak is described as starting from the pan and soaking into the floor and sheetrock. this implies that the liquid is escaping the pan and causing damage.step 2: the hypothesis states that the leak is not coming out of the pan. this is directly contradictory to the information in the premise. a leak not coming out of the pan is the opposite of what is described in the premise.step 3: based on the logical analysis, the hypothesis is not entailed by the premise as they are in direct contradiction to each other."
1463,and the same is true of the drug hangover you know if you,It's nothing like a drug hangover.,0,0,True,"step 1. the premise is stating that something is true of a 'drug hangover.' this implies a general characteristic or experience associated with a drug hangover. the hypothesis, on the other hand, asserts that 'it's nothing like a drug hangover.' this means the hypothesis denies the commonality or likeness to a drug hangover. step 2. the hypothesis directly contradicts the premise by negating the stated similarity. the hypothesis cannot be logically inferred from the premise because the premise does not provide any information that would lead to the conclusion that a 'drug hangover' is unlike something in particular. step 3. based on the logical negation of the premise in the hypothesis, the hypothesis is not entailed by the premise."
1464,"And as John Gregory Dunne reported in The New Yorker , Tom's initial allegation was not vigorously pursued in testimony.",John Dunne of the New Yorker reported that Tom's initial allegation was vigorously pursued during testimony.,0,0,True,"step 1: the premise states that john gregory dunne reported in the new yorker that tom's initial allegation was not vigorously pursued in testimony. this implies that there was an opportunity for the allegation to be pursued more aggressively but it was not taken. step 2: the hypothesis suggests the opposite of what is stated in the premise, stating that john dunne reported that tom's initial allegation was 'vigorously pursued during testimony'. this contradicts the information given in the premise. step 3: based on the given information, the hypothesis cannot be logically inferred from the premise as they present conflicting statements."
1465,"One of the largest centers is near Coniston, and there are several around Ullswater.",Coniston has only the smallest centers near it.,0,0,True,"step 1: in the premise, it is mentioned that one of the largest centers is near coniston and there are several around ullswater. this implies that coniston and ullswater are two different locations, each having different sizes and numbers of centers. step 2: in contrast, the hypothesis claims that coniston only has the smallest centers near it. this directly contradicts the information in the premise, as the premise states that there is one of the largest centers near coniston. step 3: based on the logical analysis, the hypothesis cannot be inferred from the premise, as the hypothesis contradicts the information provided in the premise."
1466,"The final rule was issued pursuant to the authority of sections 708(e)(1) and (3) of the Personal Responsibility and Work Opportunity Reconciliation Act of 1996, Pub.",The final rule was issued pursuant to the welfare act from 1996.,1,1,True,"step 1: in the premise, it is stated that the final rule was issued under the authority of sections 708(e)(1) and (3) of the personal responsibility and work opportunity reconciliation act of 1996, commonly known as the welfare act of 1996. this act is a significant piece of legislation in the united states that deals with welfare programs and work requirements.step 2: the hypothesis presents the same information as the premise, stating that the final rule was issued pursuant to the welfare act from 1996. this hypothesis is logically equivalent to the premise, as 'from the welfare act' is synonymous with 'under the authority of sections 708(e)(1) and (3)' in this context.step 3: given the logical equivalence between the premise and hypothesis, the hypothesis can be inferred from the premise as they express the same concept."
1467,At the southern end of the beach there is a small bar where you can sit and admire the dramatic view.,There are many bars near the southern end of the beach.,1,0,False,"step 1: in the premise, there is mentioned one specific bar located at the southern end of the beach. no information is given about the presence or number of other bars in the area. step 2: the hypothesis suggests that there are 'many' bars near the southern end of the beach. this contradicts the information provided in the premise, which only mentions one bar. step 3: based on the logical analysis, the hypothesis is not entailed by the premise. the premise does not provide enough information to logically infer the existence of multiple bars."
1468,"Set back from Princes Street is the National Gallery of Scotland, opened in 1858, which houses a collection of works by native Scottish artists and international masters.",The National Gallery of Scotland opened its doors in 1758.,0,0,True,"step 1: in the premise, we have several key pieces of information. the national gallery of scotland is located on princes street and was opened in 1858. the collection includes works by native scottish artists and international masters. step 2: the hypothesis states that the national gallery of scotland opened in 1758, which is a significant discrepancy from the information provided in the premise. a difference of 100 years is a substantial time period. step 3: based on the given information, the hypothesis cannot be logically inferred from the premise. the premise provides no support for the hypothesis, and the discrepancy between the two makes it unlikely that the hypothesis is true."
1469,"It sold over 60,000 copies in Greece and was certified Platinum.","It sold over 60,001 copies in Greece and was certified Platinum.",0,1,False,"step 1: in the premise, we have the information that a certain item sold over 60,000 copies in greece and was certified platinum. this suggests a high demand for the item in greece. step 2: the hypothesis states that the item sold over 60,001 copies in greece instead. a difference of one copy does not significantly change the logical relationship between the premise and hypothesis. both statements describe a situation where the item sold over 60,000 copies in greece and was certified platinum. step 3: based on the similarity between the premise and hypothesis, and the lack of any logical contradictions or inconsistencies, the hypothesis can be considered a logical extension of the premise. however, it is important to note that the hypothesis might not be factually true, as the actual number of copies sold could be different from the stated figure. step 4: the label is set to 1 for entailment, but with the understanding that this entailment is based on a logical extension of the premise, rather than a strict inference."
1470,"It was formerly an incorporated town, but it was dissolved in 2008 after a vote by residents.","It was formerly an incorporated town, but it was dissolved in 2009 after a vote by residents.",0,0,True,"step 1: both the premise and hypothesis describe that the town was formerly incorporated but was later dissolved. the year of dissolution is the only difference between the two. the premise states the year as 2008, while the hypothesis states it as 2009. step 2: the hypothesis can neither be logically inferred nor contradicted from the premise based on the given information. while the difference in years is not significant enough to contradict each other, it is also not enough to infer one from the other. step 3: based on the given information, the hypothesis is not entailed by the premise, nor is the premise entailed by the hypothesis. they represent different, but not contradictory, statements."
1471,yeah my my brother and uh sister-in-law live there i like,I visited my brother and sister-in-law recently.,1,0,False,"step 1: in the premise, it is stated that the speaker's brother and sister-in-law live at a certain location. this implies a relationship between the speaker and the brother and sister-in-law, as well as their residence. no contradictory information is provided.step 2: the hypothesis suggests a recent visit to the same brother and sister-in-law. this can be inferred from the premise because the premise establishes their residence as a place known to the speaker. the fact that the speaker lives far away or has not visited recently is not mentioned, but the hypothesis does not contradict the premise.step 3: based on the information provided, the hypothesis is not logically entailed by the premise but can be considered plausible, as the premise does not exclude the possibility of a recent visit. however, more context might be needed to definitively determine the entailment relationship between the premise and hypothesis."
1472,"The clues are not obvious, but they are not too hard to get either, especially after a second or third rerun.",I was not able to find any clues because they were so well-hidden.,0,0,True,"step 1: in the premise, the clues are described as not obvious but not too hard to find once one has seen the show multiple times. this implies that the clues exist and are solvable, but they may require some effort and knowledge.step 2: the hypothesis suggests that the person was unable to find any clues. this contradicts the premise, as it states that the clues can be found with some effort.step 3: based on the given information, the hypothesis is not entailed by the premise. the premise does not imply that everyone will be able to find the clues immediately or without any effort, but it does state that they are solvable with some persistence. the hypothesis, on the other hand, suggests that the clues are unsolvable or not present at all, which is not a logical conclusion that can be drawn from the premise."
1473,"It was like the Classic experiment--""  ""How hot is your sun?""  There was a long pause.",It should have been like the Classic experiment.,1,1,True,"step 1: in the premise, it is described that the situation was similar to the 'classic experiment' but the nature of this experiment is not explicitly stated. however, the context suggests that the 'classic experiment' is likely a well-known scientific experiment. the hypothesis also refers to the experiment being like the 'classic experiment.'step 2: the hypothesis does not provide new information about the temperature of the sun. instead, it suggests that the methodology of the experiment should have been the same as the 'classic experiment.' since the premise already mentions that the situation was 'like' the 'classic experiment,' the hypothesis does not contradict or add any new logical information.step 3: based on the given information and the lack of any contradiction, the hypothesis 'it should have been like the classic experiment' is entailed by the premise 'it was like the classic experiment-- "
1474,Federal Program Failed.,The federal program failed due to a lack of caring.,1,0,False,"step 1: a failed federal program is one that did not achieve its intended goals or objectives. this can be due to various reasons such as insufficient funding, mismanagement, poor implementation, or external factors. the premise does not provide any specific information about the cause of the failure.step 2: the hypothesis proposes a possible cause for the failure, which is a lack of caring. this could refer to a lack of caring on the part of those responsible for implementing the program, or a lack of caring from the public or stakeholders. however, the premise does not directly provide evidence for this cause.step 3: to determine if the hypothesis is logically entailed by the premise, we need to consider if the lack of caring is a possible cause for a failed federal program. this is a plausible explanation, as lack of caring can lead to mismanagement, lack of motivation, or other issues that could contribute to a failed program. however, we cannot definitively infer this cause from the premise alone, as there are other possible causes for a failed federal program.step 4: while the hypothesis is a plausible explanation, it is not logically entailed by the premise. the premise only states that the federal program failed, without providing any information about the cause of the failure."
1475,"Still, it is bad news that maternal bonding begins with hormones at birth.",Children who did not bond with their mothers have emotional issues later in life.,1,0,False,"step 1: in the premise, it is stated that maternal bonding begins with hormones at birth. this suggests a causal relationship between the hormonal response at birth and the formation of a mother-child bond. no specific information is given about children who did not bond with their mothers. however, the premise does not imply any contradiction with the hypothesis.step 2: the hypothesis infers that children who did not bond with their mothers have emotional issues later in life. this could be a reasonable inference based on common sense and numerous studies that show the importance of maternal bonding for children's emotional development. however, the hypothesis goes beyond the information provided in the premise, as it makes a claim about the consequences of not bonding, rather than the cause (hormonal response at birth).step 3: the hypothesis is not directly entailed by the premise, as the premise does not provide enough information to logically deduce the hypothesis. however, the hypothesis is consistent with the premise and could be a plausible extension based on common knowledge and research findings.step 4: while the hypothesis could be a plausible extension of the premise, it is important to note that the premise itself is a simplification and may not capture the full complexity of maternal bonding and its relationship to children's emotional development. the hypothesis should be considered as a possible, but not definitive, inference from the premise."
1476,"Our crack development team (that is, our development team that is crack, not our team developing crack) is hard at work on Slate Search 3.0.",Slate Search 3.0 will be released in April.,1,0,False,"step 1: the premise states that the crack development team is working on slate search 3.0. 'crack' in this context refers to a highly skilled, efficient, or innovative team. it does not imply any illegal activities. step 2: the hypothesis proposes a specific release month for slate search 3.0. there is no information in the premise that directly states or infers the release date of slate search 3.0. step 3: based on the given information, there is no logical entailment between the premise and the hypothesis. the hypothesis is not logically necessary or implied by the premise."
1477,Congress took These steps in response to management problems so common among federal agencies that they demanded governmentwide solutions.,Congress took steps to respond to management problems to make managers more receptive to change.,1,1,True,"step 1: in the premise, congress is described as taking steps in response to management problems that were so prevalent they required governmentwide solutions. this implies that there were significant issues with management within various federal agencies. the hypothesis suggests that congress took steps to make managers more receptive to change. these two ideas are related as both discuss the actions of congress in response to management issues.step 2: the hypothesis can be inferred from the premise because making managers more receptive to change could be considered a solution to the management problems that were demanding governmentwide attention. by making managers more open to change, the underlying issues may be more effectively addressed, thereby satisfying the requirement for governmentwide solutions.step 3: based on the logical connection between the premise and hypothesis, and the reasonable inference that making managers more receptive to change could be a response to management problems, the hypothesis can be inferred from the premise."
1479,hadn't been able to play so i took out a few videos and watched them for a while and i i hope i'm on the right track you know i shot a career low eighty nine so and my handicap's twenty i,I watched more than ten hours of videos.,1,1,True,"step 1: in the premise, the speaker mentions that they watched 'a few videos' for an unspecified duration. there is no explicit statement indicating that they watched more than ten hours. however, the speaker does mention feeling discouraged about their golf game and watching videos as a way to improve, suggesting a significant time investment. common sense and context suggest that 'a few videos' could reasonably refer to more than ten hours of content, especially if the videos are lengthy instructional materials.step 2: the hypothesis, 'i watched more than ten hours of videos', can be inferred from the premise because the premise does not exclude the possibility of more than ten hours of viewing time. the premise only specifies 'a few videos', which is a vague term that could encompass a significant amount of time.step 3: based on the logical reasoning, the lack of explicit contradiction in the premise, and the common-sense interpretation of 'a few videos' as potentially referring to more than ten hours, the hypothesis can be inferred from the premise."
1480,yeah yes uh too much we give away way too much in my in my opinion,I think that we need to give away more.,0,0,True,"step 1: in the premise, the speaker expresses their opinion that 'we give away way too much'. this implies a belief that the current level of giving is excessive. step 2: the hypothesis, 'i think that we need to give away more', contradicts the premise, as it suggests an opposite opinion, that more giving is needed. step 3: based on the logical analysis, the hypothesis cannot be inferred from the premise, as they represent opposing views."
1481,"What occurred then is unclear but despite a meeting between Verginius and Vindex, the forces under Verginius seemed to have decided on a battle without orders.","despite a meeting between Verginius and Vindex, the forces under Verginius seemed to have decided on a battle without orders.",0,1,False,"step 1: both the premise and hypothesis describe the same situation where a meeting took place between verginius and vindex, but the forces under verginius decided to engage in a battle without receiving explicit orders. no contradictory information is presented in the premise or hypothesis.step 2: the hypothesis can be logically inferred from the premise since the premise does not state that verginius gave orders for the battle, only that there was a meeting between the two. the fact that the forces under verginius decided to fight without orders implies that they made this decision on their own.step 3: based on the logical relationship between the premise and hypothesis and the absence of contradictory information, the hypothesis is entailed by the premise."
1482,you know it seems like when they go to prison it they really seem like it's a rough time for them and a murderer well go to prison oh he's just there to serve his time and get back out on the street,It seems like some murderers are able to get out of prison early to re-offend.,1,0,False,"step 1: in the premise, it is mentioned that it seems like when people go to prison, they have a rough time, and a murderer is described as being in prison to serve his time and get back out on the street. this implies that the general expectation is that prisoners serve their time and are eventually released. however, there's no mention of any specific rules or circumstances that would prevent a murderer from getting out of prison early. step 2: the hypothesis introduces the idea that some murderers are able to get out of prison early to re-offend. this contradicts the general expectation stated in the premise. however, it is not a logical impossibility for this to occur. prisoners can have their sentences reduced for good behavior or through various legal processes. step 3: based on the given information, it cannot be definitively concluded that the hypothesis is entailed by the premise, as the premise does not exclude the possibility of early release for prisoners, but the hypothesis goes beyond the stated information by assuming that some murderers specifically are able to do so. therefore, the hypothesis is not entailed by the premise, but it is not a contradiction either."
1483,"A block removed from Waikiki Beach, but a few steps from the heart of the Waikiki shopping district, the Princess Kaiulani dates back to 1955, but the rooms are all updated and its 29-story tower is much newer.",Waikiki Beach features a strip mall called the Princess Kaiulani.,0,0,True,"step 1: in the premise, we learn about the princess kaiulani, which is a building located near waikiki beach, with a history dating back to 1955, but with updated rooms and a newer 29-story tower. step 2: the hypothesis proposes a 'strip mall' named princess kaiulani located at waikiki beach. while the premise doesn't explicitly mention a strip mall or any specific features regarding the princess kaiulani building, it doesn't contradict the hypothesis either. however, the hypothesis makes an assumption about the nature of the princess kaiulani building. step 3: in order to evaluate the hypothesis, we need to consider if it can be reasonably inferred from the given information. a strip mall is a type of commercial development that typically features multiple stores or businesses under one roof, often with a shared parking lot. there's no mention of this type of layout in the premise, which makes the hypothesis an uncertain inference from the given information. step 4: based on the available information, the hypothesis cannot be definitively determined to be entailed by the premise."
1485,and it was so interesting because they were relating the war to these children in their studio and they also had children calling in live from all over the country and asking questions and they they had all their correspondents in the different areas in Saudi Arabia and Israel and and all they had them all uh on i don't know what you'd call it other than on line they had them all on hold and if a child asked a question that the person in Jerusalem could best answer they would cut to that person and that person would answer the question it was just very,They had correspondents in different areas and put the focus on them and ignored the children.,0,0,True,"step 1: in the premise, there are several elements described: a radio broadcast about the war, children participating and asking questions, correspondents in different areas, and a method of connecting children with correspondents. the focus seems to be on the interaction between children and correspondents.step 2: the hypothesis suggests a different focus, where the correspondents are the main actors and the children are ignored. this is a significant departure from the premise, as the premise indicates children actively participating and having their questions answered.step 3: based on the information provided, the hypothesis is not logically entailed by the premise. the premise describes the involvement of children in the radio broadcast, and the hypothesis suggests a different focus, which is not implied by the premise."
1486,Three people are standing on the dock of a boat looking at something off-camera.,A ghost is holding the camera.,0,0,True,"step 1: in the premise, three people are described as being on a dock and looking at something off-camera. this scenario does not inherently provide any information about the presence or absence of a ghost. common sense and logical principles do not allow us to infer the existence of a ghost based on this information. step 2: the hypothesis 'a ghost is holding the camera' contradicts the premise, as it introduces an entity (the ghost) that is not mentioned or suggested in the premise. step 3: based on the logical reasoning and lack of information in the premise, the hypothesis 'a ghost is holding the camera' cannot be inferred from the premise."
1487,"Until restoration is complete, the main reason to hit the area is to check out cultural sites, including the museums.",There is nothing else to do until restoration is finished.,0,0,True,"step 1: in the premise, it is stated that the main reason to visit the area is to check out cultural sites, such as museums, until restoration is complete. this implies that there are cultural sites worth visiting in the area. step 2: the hypothesis suggests that there is nothing else to do in the area until restoration is finished. while it is true that checking out cultural sites is the main activity suggested in the premise, the hypothesis goes beyond this by implying that no other activities are possible. this is not directly stated or logically implied in the premise. step 3: based on the given information, the hypothesis cannot be logically inferred from the premise, as it adds an unnecessary and unsupported assumption about the absence of other activities in the area."
1488,yeah well i i've seen more graduates from MIT and that being,I have seen more graduates from MIT and they are very successful.,1,1,True,"step 1: both the premise and hypothesis describe your personal experience of seeing graduates from mit. the hypothesis expands upon the premise by adding the information that these graduates are successful. this expanded information does not contradict the premise.step 2: the hypothesis can be logically inferred from the premise. if you have seen more graduates from mit (premise), it naturally follows that you have also seen these graduates being successful (hypothesis), assuming success is a common trait among mit graduates.step 3: based on the logical reasoning and the lack of contradictory information, the hypothesis is entailed by the premise."
1489,"Nothing more."" He lit a cigarette with a hand that shook ever so little.","He was nervous, which caused his hands to shake.",1,1,True,"step 1: in the premise, 'nothing more' suggests a simple statement of fact. 'he lit a cigarette' is an action, and 'with a hand that shook ever so little' describes a physical condition. common sense and logical principles do not inherently contradict the hypothesis. step 2: 'he was nervous' is a possible explanation for 'his hands shook'. nervousness is a common cause for hand tremors. the hypothesis is consistent with the premise if we consider 'nervous' as an additional fact not explicitly stated. step 3: based on the logical reasoning and common sense, the hypothesis can be inferred from the premise, as 'his hands shaking' could be a result of 'him being nervous'."
1490,i'm on i'm in the Plano school system and living in Richardson and there is a real dichotomy in terms of educational and economic background of the kids that are going to be attending this school,The Plano school system only has children with poor intelligence.,0,0,True,"step 1. in the premise, it is mentioned that there is a 'real dichotomy' in the plano school system regarding the educational and economic backgrounds of the students. this implies that there is a significant difference between the socio-economic groups within the school system. the premise does not provide any direct information about the intelligence of the students.step 2. the hypothesis, however, makes a generalized statement that 'the plano school system only has children with poor intelligence.' this is a clear contradiction to the premise, as the premise only states that there is a socio-economic difference among the students, not a statement about their intelligence.step 3. based on the logical analysis, the hypothesis cannot be inferred from the premise as it directly contradicts the information provided in the premise.step 4. furthermore, the hypothesis is an oversimplification and a baseless assumption about the students in the plano school system."
1491,Newton Elementary School serves most of west Jasper County 's first through sixth graders under principal Travis Wyatt.,"Newton Elementary School is located in the county seat of Newton, and serves most of west Jasper County's first through sixth graders under principal Travis Wyatt.",1,1,True,"step 1: in the premise, we have a school named newton elementary school that serves most of the first through sixth graders in west jasper county under principal travis wyatt. no specific location is mentioned.step 2: the hypothesis states that newton elementary school is located in the county seat of newton and still serves most of west jasper county's first through sixth graders under principal travis wyatt. the additional information about the location is a known fact that is consistent with the premise, as newton is a common name for county seats in various places.step 3: since the hypothesis adds a known fact that is consistent with the premise, and does not contradict or change the meaning of the premise, it can be inferred from the premise.therefore, the hypothesis is logically entailed by the premise."
1492,"He has contributed criticism to "" Art in America "" Art in America "" and "" Art New England "", among others.","He has contributed criticism to ""Art in America"" and ""Art New England"", among others.",1,1,True,"step 1: in the premise, it is stated that 'he has contributed criticism to art in america and art new england, among others.' this means that the named magazines are part of a list of publications where this person has published criticism.step 2: the hypothesis also states that 'he has contributed criticism to art in america and art new england, among others.' this is identical to the premise in every material respect. the hypothesis does not add any new information, so the hypothesis is logically entailed by the premise.step 3: based on the logical identity of the hypothesis and the premise, the hypothesis is a logical consequence of the premise."
1493,Accompanying the discussion of each practice is a case illustration involving a federal agency that has made progress in incorporating the practice into its operations.,Many federal agencies have made progress incorporating the practice into its operations. ,1,1,True,"step 1: the premise describes a situation where each practice is discussed and accompanied by a case illustration of a federal agency that has made progress in implementing the practice. this implies that there are multiple federal agencies that have successfully implemented the practice. step 2: the hypothesis suggests that 'many' federal agencies have made progress in incorporating the practice into their operations. this is a generalization of the information provided in the premise, as it implies that more than one agency has made such progress. step 3: the hypothesis can be logically inferred from the premise, as the premise provides specific examples of federal agencies that have made progress, implying that there are many such agencies. step 4: it is also important to note that there is no contradictory information in the premise or hypothesis that would prevent the hypothesis from being logically inferred."
1494,"In fiscal year 2000, it reported estimated improper Medicare Fee-for-Service payments of $11.",Fee-for-Service payments are higher than other forms of payments.,1,0,False,"step 1: in the premise, it is mentioned that in fiscal year 2000, there were estimated improper medicare fee-for-service payments of $11. this indicates that there are payments under the medicare fee-for-service program, and some of these payments were identified as being improper. it does not provide any direct comparison of fee-for-service payments to other forms of payments. step 2: the hypothesis asserts that fee-for-service payments are higher than other forms of payments. this is not logically inferred from the premise. the premise only mentions that there were improper payments under the fee-for-service program, it does not provide any information about the overall amount or proportion of fee-for-service payments compared to other forms of payments. step 3: based on the information provided in the premise and hypothesis, there is no logical entailment between them. the hypothesis goes beyond the given information."
1495,is there still that type of music available,I could care less if the music still existed.,0,0,True,"step 1: in the premise, there is no specific information about the existence or non-existence of a certain type of music. it only asks if it's 'still available'. step 2: the hypothesis, 'i could care less if the music still existed', is an expression of indifference or lack of interest. this statement does not provide any logical connection or contradiction to the premise, as it does not depend on the availability of the music. step 3: based on the given information, the hypothesis cannot be logically inferred from the premise."
1496,um well i go home in the summer and i work in the summer and between what i make in the summer and student loans that's how i go to college,I do not have any students loans and have never had a summer job. ,0,0,True,"step 1: in the premise, the speaker mentions that they go home in the summer, work during the summer, and use the income from their summer job and student loans to pay for college. this implies that they have both a summer job and student loans.step 2: the hypothesis states that the speaker does not have and has never had student loans. this directly contradicts the information provided in the premise.step 3: based on the contradiction, the hypothesis cannot be logically inferred from the premise.step 4: it is important to note that the premise does not provide any explicit information about the speaker's financial situation outside of the summer months. however, the information in the premise is sufficient to determine that the hypothesis is not entailed by the premise."
1497,"Her proudest achievement, though, was the Green Revolution that modernized wheat and rice farming to give India, for the first time in its history, self-sufficiency in food production.",The failed Green Revolution left India starving for food imports.,0,0,True,"step 1: in the premise, it is stated that the green revolution was a significant achievement for this person that led to india's self-sufficiency in food production. this means that the green revolution was successful in providing india with enough food. step 2: the hypothesis suggests a failed green revolution which is contradictory to the premise, as the two statements cannot both be true. step 3: based on the logical negation of the premise in the hypothesis and the clear contradiction between the two statements, the hypothesis is not entailed by the premise.step 4: it is essential to note that the hypothesis does not necessarily imply that there was famine or food imports during the green revolution, as it only states that the green revolution 'failed'. however, the premise does not provide any information about the time period following the green revolution or the overall food situation during that time. thus, it is possible that there were other factors contributing to any food imports or food scarcity issues in india, so the hypothesis might not be a completely accurate description of the historical context.step 5: ultimately, the hypothesis is not logically entailed by the premise due to their contradictory nature, and further context and historical information is necessary to evaluate the validity of the hypothesis in a broader sense."
1498,uh plastic is just too easy i mean that's the that's the whole problem with it um have,I am addicted to shopping online with my plastic credit card.,1,0,False,"step 1: in the premise, the speaker expresses a concern about the ease of use of plastic, indicating a problem with it. this statement does not provide any direct information about shopping or credit cards.step 2: the hypothesis describes a personal behavior of shopping online with a plastic credit card, implying a dependency or addiction to this practice. there is no clear logical connection between the premise and hypothesis. common sense or factual information does not suggest that a person expressing concerns about plastic is necessarily addicted to shopping with it.step 3: based on the information provided, the hypothesis cannot be logically inferred from the premise. the premise does not provide sufficient information to conclude that the speaker is addicted to shopping online with a plastic credit card.thought_process: "
1499,all they you know thinking that they're going to have money and jobs and success and everything and then they then there is no jobs and they end up homeless and not knowing anybody and no money and it's terrible,They don't contribute anything to society. ,1,0,False,"step 1. in the premise, there is a description of a situation where people have high expectations for money, jobs, and success, but end up homeless and penniless. this scenario does not provide any explicit information about the individuals' contributions to society. step 2. the hypothesis makes an assertion about the individuals not contributing anything to society. this statement is not logically entailed by the premise, as the premise does not provide enough information to make such a claim. step 3. based on the given information, the hypothesis cannot be inferred from the premise."
1500,The downtown area developed around the waterfront.,The downtown area is entirely landlocked,0,0,True,"step 1: the premise states that the downtown area developed around the waterfront. this indicates that the downtown area is located near a body of water. common sense and factual knowledge tell us that 'developed around the waterfront' typically means that there is water present in the area.step 2: the hypothesis, 'the downtown area is entirely landlocked', contradicts the premise. a landlocked area is one that is not connected to a sea or a lake by water. the information provided in the premise does not support the hypothesis as it states the opposite, that the downtown area is located near water.step 3: based on the logical analysis, it is clear that the hypothesis cannot be inferred from the premise as the premise and hypothesis contradict each other."
4503,He addressed the Kal.,Kal addressed other people.,0,0,True,"step 1: the premise states that 'he addressed the kal'. this implies that 'he' is speaking or communicating to 'the kal'. step 2: the hypothesis suggests 'kal addressed other people'. this is not directly contradictory to the premise, but it does not logically follow. it is possible for both the premise and hypothesis to be true in different contexts, such as 'he' addressing the kal and then kal addressing other people. however, no information in the premise indicates that kal was the one being addressed by other people. step 3: based on the given information, the hypothesis cannot be logically inferred from the premise."
4504,I do not want Kitchell in this country any more than you do.,I want Kitchell to stay in this country. ,0,0,True,"step 1: the premise states that both the speaker and the listener do not want kitchell in the country. this implies a shared desire to remove kitchell from the country. step 2: the hypothesis suggests the opposite, that the speaker wants kitchell to stay in the country. this contradicts the premise. step 3: the hypothesis cannot be logically inferred from the premise, as they express contradictory desires."
4505,you know it took away a lot of of time from them we did go out to you know to the places that you typically take children to and we had a lot of fun but it seems as though the time went by so fast that,Time went by fast and we went golfing with the kids.,1,0,False,"step 1: in the premise, it is mentioned that the speakers went out to places typically taken for children and had fun, but the time went by quickly. the fact that time went by quickly is not dependent on where they went or what they did. in this context, 'went golfing with the kids' is a possible activity, as golfing can be enjoyed by children and adults alike.step 2: the hypothesis 'time went by fast and we went golfing with the kids' is not directly entailed by the premise 'you know it took away a lot of time from them we did go out to you know to the places that you typically take children to and we had a lot of fun but it seems as though the time went by so fast'. however, the hypothesis is not contradictory to the premise either. the fact that time went by quickly does not exclude the possibility of golfing.step 3: based on the given information and logical principles, there isn't enough evidence provided in the premise to infer the hypothesis with certainty. the hypothesis, while not contradictory to the premise, is not entailed by it."
4506,no i don't think so either um,I do believe this.,0,0,True,"step 1: i cannot perform logical reasoning or inference based on an empty premise. the premise 'no i don't think so either um' does not provide sufficient information for analysis. it is unclear what is being denied or disagreed upon. step 2: without a clear premise, no logical relationship or inference can be established between the premise and hypothesis. step 3: the absence of a clear premise makes it impossible to determine if the hypothesis can be logically inferred from it."
4507,yeah yeah well i guess they were uh i guess they must have been scared,They were trembling due to extreme fright.,1,1,True,"step 1: in the premise, the speaker indicates that 'they' were scared. 'scared' is a state of fear or terror. 'trembling' in the hypothesis is a physical manifestation of intense fear. both 'scared' and 'trembling due to extreme fright' describe similar emotional states, and there's no contradictory information in the premise that would negate the hypothesis.step 2: the hypothesis 'they were trembling due to extreme fright' can be logically inferred from the premise 'they must have been scared' because 'scared' implies emotional fear, and 'trembling due to extreme fright' describes a physical manifestation of that fear.step 3: based on the logical connection between 'scared' and 'trembling due to extreme fright', the hypothesis can be inferred from the premise."
4508,A dog running on grass,A dog is digging in the snow.,0,0,True,"step 1. the premise describes a scene where a dog is running on grass. this provides no specific information about the conditions or actions beyond the dog running. common sense and logical principles do not allow for the direct inference of a dog digging in the snow from this premise. step 2. the hypothesis introduces a different scenario, one where a dog is digging in the snow, which is not logically implied or related to the premise. step 3. based on the provided information, the hypothesis cannot be logically inferred from the premise."
4509,"The first two, LSTech and LegalMeetings, will be available to all LSC grantees, not just TIG recipients.",LSTech and LegalMeetings used to not be available to all LSC grantees,1,0,False,"step 1: in the premise, it is stated that lstech and legalmeetings will be available to all lsc grantees. this means that these services are now accessible to all grantees, regardless of whether they are tig recipients or not. step 2: the hypothesis contradicts the information in the premise, as it suggests that lstech and legalmeetings used to not be available to all lsc grantees. this makes it an incorrect or unreasonable inference from the premise. step 3: based on the logical reasoning and the contradiction between the hypothesis and the premise, the hypothesis is not entailed by the premise."
4510,"Each country has made a different cost/service tradeoff, which is reflected in each country's concept of universal service.","The cost/service tradeoff in different countries is vastly different,",1,1,True,"step 1: in the premise, it is stated that each country has made a unique cost/service tradeoff in regards to universal service. this implies that there are variations in the cost and level of service provided by different countries. this is a factual observation based on the given information. step 2: the hypothesis asserts that the cost/service tradeoffs in different countries are 'vastly different'. given the premise, this hypothesis can be logically inferred since it doesn't contradict the premise and is a more specific implication of the premise's statement about unique tradeoffs. step 3: based on the logical reasoning and the facts stated in the premise, the hypothesis is a logical entailment."
4511,These adaptations are not uniformly valued.,Adaptions are always valued ,0,0,True,"step 1: in the premise, 'these adaptations are not uniformly valued' indicates that the value of adaptations can vary. this statement does not imply that adaptations have no value or that they are always valued. it only suggests that there is no consistent valuation of adaptations.step 2: the hypothesis 'adaptations are always valued' contradicts the premise as it asserts a universally positive valuation for adaptations, which is inconsistent with the premise's assertion that the value of adaptations is not uniform.step 3: based on the logical analysis, the hypothesis 'adaptations are always valued' cannot be logically inferred from the premise 'these adaptations are not uniformly valued'."
4512,so  well what are we supposed to i i was kind of fumbling this was the first i haven't been home other nights when they've called so this is the first time i've participated,i've been home every night this week and they still haven't called,0,0,True,"step 1: in the premise, the speaker mentions that this is the first night they've participated in the call, implying that they have not participated in the call on previous nights this week. no specific number of nights is mentioned, but the implication is that there have been other nights this week aside from this one.step 2: the hypothesis suggests that despite the speaker not participating in the call on this night, they have been home every night this week. while the premise implies that the speaker was not home on some nights this week, it does not directly contradict the hypothesis, as the number of nights is not explicitly stated. however, based on the information provided, it is not a logical inference that the speaker has been home every night this week. the hypothesis contradicts the premise's implication.step 3: based on the logical analysis, the hypothesis cannot be logically inferred from the premise, as the premise implies the opposite."
4513,"I didn't get it at the time."" The thought saddened him a little, for it seemed to prove that Mrs. Vandemeyer and the girl were on intimate terms.",Everyone already knew about Mrs. Vandemeyer and the girl.,0,1,False,"step 1: in the premise, the speaker admits to not understanding a situation at the time, which was the discovery of mrs. vandemeyer and the girl being together. the statement 'it seemed to prove' indicates that the speaker has made an inference based on this observation. this inference is that mrs. vandemeyer and the girl were on intimate terms. step 2: the hypothesis suggests that 'everyone already knew' about mrs. vandemeyer and the girl. this implies that the information was common knowledge within the community. step 3: the hypothesis can be inferred from the premise if we consider the context and common sense. the fact that the speaker was saddened by not having known about this earlier suggests that he believed others did know. thus, it is a reasonable assumption that the community was aware of mrs. vandemeyer and the girl's relationship. therefore, the hypothesis can be logically inferred from the premise given the context and common-sense understanding."
4514,"Those honorably discharged before Oct. 1, 1949, for at least 30-percent disability.","Those discharged before the month of October, said the lawyer.",1,1,True,"step 1: in the premise, the condition for those who are eligible for the disability benefits is being honorably discharged before oct. 1, 1949, and having at least a 30-percent disability. step 2: the hypothesis states that those discharged before 'the month of october' are being discussed. the lawyer's statement does not explicitly mention the year in 'the month of october,' but it is clear from the context and common sense that the lawyer is likely referring to october 1949 or earlier, given the topic of disability benefits and the premise's criteria. step 3: based on the given information and context, it can be reasonably inferred that the hypothesis is entailed by the premise, as the hypothesis's condition (discharged before october) is a subset of the premise's condition (discharged before oct. 1, 1949)."
4516,right i think it's seven here or seven point something,Right I think it's five here or five point something.,0,0,True,"step 1: in this example, both the premise and hypothesis are statements about a person's belief regarding the value of something being around five or seven, with a small possibility of it being a specific decimal point. there is no logical connection or contradiction between the two statements based on the given information. step 2: since the premise and hypothesis are about different values, one cannot be logically inferred from the other. the hypothesis does not follow from the premise, and neither does the premise follow from the hypothesis. step 3: based on the lack of logical connection and the absence of contradiction, the hypothesis is not entailed by the premise."
4517,"Just north of the Shalom Tower is the Yemenite Quarter, its main attractions being the bustling Carmel market and good Oriental restaurants.",The Shalom Tower is north of the Yemenite Quarter.,0,0,True,"step 1: in the premise, it is explicitly stated that 'just north of the shalom tower' is the yemenite quarter. this information establishes the spatial relationship between the shalom tower and the yemenite quarter, with the shalom tower being to the south of the yemenite quarter. however, the hypothesis merely restates that the shalom tower is north of the yemenite quarter, which is the reverse of the relationship stated in the premise. step 2: while the hypothesis contradicts the premise, it is still a logically valid statement, as it only changes the way we express the same spatial relationship. the hypothesis does not add any new or contradictory information. step 3: the hypothesis is not directly entailed by the premise because they state the same spatial relationship in opposite ways. however, they represent logically equivalent statements. in real-world contexts, we often use interchangeable directions (e.g., north or south) when discussing locations, and the premise and hypothesis remain factually consistent. thus, even though they are not identical, they convey the same logical meaning."
4518,Life aboard ship is tough,Life aboard a goat is easy.,0,0,True,"step 1. the premise describes life as being tough aboard a ship. this implies various challenges and hardships due to the maritime environment. common sense and factual knowledge do not provide any connection between the premise and hypothesis. step 2. the hypothesis states that life aboard a goat is easy. there is no such thing as 'life aboard a goat.' a goat is an animal, not a vessel or living structure where life could be lived. step 3. given that the hypothesis is not logically related to the premise and contains an erroneous assumption, it cannot be inferred from the premise.step 4. the hypothesis contradicts the premise, as 'tough' implies challenges, while 'easy' implies the absence of such challenges. therefore, the hypothesis is not entailed by the premise and is factually incorrect."
4519,"Old man, said Adrin.",The old man was coming to attack the village.,1,0,False,"step 1: in the premise, 'old man, said adrin' is a simple statement of a spoken phrase by a character named adrin. it does not provide any context or information about the old man's intentions or actions. step 2: the hypothesis, 'the old man was coming to attack the village,' is a much stronger statement, implying a hostile intent on the part of the old man. this information is not present or implied in the premise. therefore, the hypothesis cannot be logically inferred from the premise. step 3: based on the lack of logical connection and the contradiction in the level of detail and information between the premise and hypothesis, the hypothesis is not entailed by the premise."
4520,It is a fried dough food that is elliptical in shape and resembles an ox tongue.,It is a fried dough food that is elliptical in shape and resembles an ox tongue or a horse ear.,1,1,True,"step 1: the premise describes a specific fried dough food that is elliptical in shape and has a resemblance to an ox tongue. this information is clear and unambiguous. step 2: the hypothesis expands upon the description in the premise by adding 'or a horse ear'. this addition does not contradict the information in the premise, as both an ox tongue and a horse ear share the elliptical shape. step 3: therefore, the hypothesis can be logically inferred from the premise, as the hypothesis expands upon the premise by providing an additional, non-contradictory detail."
4521,The door was opened by an irreproachable butler.,A butler quickly whipped open the door when he heard someone outside.,1,1,True,"step 1: in the premise, an 'irreproachable butler' is stated to have opened the door. this implies that the butler is reliable, orderly, and has a good reputation. step 2: in the hypothesis, 'a butler quickly whipped open the door when he heard someone outside', we see an action consistent with the premise's description of the butler being reliable and orderly. the 'quickly' suggests a sense of urgency, which is also consistent with the butler's expected behavior to answer to someone outside. step 3: the hypothesis is logically entailed by the premise as it doesn't contradict any information and provides an additional detail that can be inferred from the given information."
4523,I will not read the details of the coup that was planned.,The part about the coup was too troubling for me.,1,0,False,"step 1: in the premise, the speaker explicitly states that they will not read the details of the coup. this implies that the speaker has decided not to engage with the information about the coup.step 2: the hypothesis suggests a reason why the speaker might have chosen not to read the details of the coup - it was too troubling for them. this reason is not contradictory to the premise, and it is a common reaction to avoid reading or hearing about uncomfortable or distressing information.step 3: based on the given information and common sense reasoning, the hypothesis can be seen as a possible explanation for the speaker's decision not to read the details of the coup as stated in the premise. therefore, the hypothesis is not logically entailed by the premise, but it is a reasonable inference that could be drawn from it.step 4: however, it is important to note that the hypothesis does not necessarily follow from the premise alone, and other explanations for the speaker's decision not to read the details of the coup are also possible. for example, the speaker might not have had the time or opportunity to read the details, or they might not have been interested in the coup.therefore, while the hypothesis is a plausible inference, it is not a definitively entailed conclusion based on the premise alone."
4524,"Romans infused Greek refinement with their own energy to create a unique mixture of elegance and realism, delicacy and strength, which have remained the essence of Italian life and art.",The Romans did not believe in strength.,0,0,True,"step 1: in the premise, the romans are described as infusing greek refinement with their own energy, creating a unique mixture of elegance and realism, delicacy and strength. the words 'elegance', 'realism', 'delicacy', and 'strength' imply contrasting but complementary qualities. they suggest a culture that valued both refined art and practical power.step 2: the hypothesis 'the romans did not believe in strength' contradicts the information in the premise. the premise states that the romans infused their own energy into greek refinement, and 'energy' and 'strength' are synonymous in this context.step 3: based on the logical analysis, the hypothesis 'the romans did not believe in strength' cannot be logically inferred from the premise as it contradicts the information provided."
4525,GPRA requires first that agencies consult with Congress and other stakeholders to clearly define their missions.,The GPRA heavily interferes with decision making regarding missions by agents.,1,0,False,"step 1: in the premise, gpra is stated as a requirement for agencies to consult with congress and stakeholders to clearly define their missions. this implies a process of collaboration and definition, not an interference. however, the hypothesis suggests that gpra interferes with decision making. step 2: the hypothesis and the premise appear to contradict each other. the premise indicates a collaborative and defining role for gpra, while the hypothesis suggests an interfering role. however, it's important to note that the premise does not limit the consultation and definition process to be a simple, quick process. agencies may face challenges or delays during this process which could impact their decision making. step 3: while the hypothesis cannot be logically inferred from the premise, as they seem to contradict each other, it's important to consider that the premise does not exclude the possibility of challenges or delays in the consultation and definition process. it's reasonable that under certain circumstances, the need to consult and clearly define missions could lead to delays or complications in decision making. however, this is not an inherent property of gpra itself, but rather a potential outcome of the process. therefore, the hypothesis is not entailed by the premise, but it doesn't contradict it either if we consider the complexity and potential challenges of the mission definition process.step 4: in practice, the gpra implementation may vary depending on the specific context and circumstances of each agency. some agencies may face less complexity in their mission definition process, while others may encounter significant challenges. therefore, it's essential to consider the context and specifics of each situation when evaluating the relationship between the premise and the hypothesis."
4526,"Founded in 1979, AFFIRM's members include information resource management professionals within the federal, academic, and industry sectors.",AFFIRM was founded in the early 2000s.,0,0,True,"step 1: in the premise, the year of affirm's founding, 1979, is provided. this information establishes the fact that affirm is an organization with a long history. step 2: the hypothesis, 'affirm was founded in the early 2000s', contradicts the premise as it suggests a much more recent founding date. step 3: based on the information provided in the premise, the hypothesis 'affirm was founded in the early 2000s' cannot be logically inferred as it contradicts the established fact."
4528,"If you please. John rang the bell, and ordered round the car. ",John rung them on the telephone.,0,0,True,"step 1: the premise describes two separate actions performed by john: 'john rang the bell' and 'john ordered round the car'. the term 'rang' in this context implies making a sound by striking an object, such as a bell. the term 'ordered round' is less clear but contextually appears to mean john arranged for or ordered something, possibly a car service.step 2: the hypothesis presents a different interpretation for the first action, suggesting john ranged or rang something on the telephone instead. this is a significant difference, as ringing a bell and ringing a telephone produce different sounds and serve different purposes.step 3: the hypothesis cannot be logically inferred from the premise, as the premise does not provide enough information to support this conclusion. the hypothesis contradicts the premise, as it proposes a different action for the first sentence. therefore, the hypothesis is not entailed by the premise."
4529,But on reflection he dismissed the idea.,"After thinking about it again, he decided it was a great idea. ",0,0,True,"step 1: the premise indicates that the person initially dismissed an idea. this implies a change of mind from a negative to a neutral or positive perspective. however, the premise does not provide enough information to determine the reason for the change of mind or the nature of the idea. step 2: the hypothesis proposes a contrary change of mind, from dismissing the idea to deciding it was great. this is a logical possibility, as people can change their minds. however, the lack of information in the premise about the reason for the initial dismissal or the nature of the idea makes it uncertain if the hypothesis can be inferred from the premise. step 3: without sufficient information in the premise to establish the reason for the change of mind or the nature of the idea, it is not possible to determine if the hypothesis is entailed by the premise."
4530,"Most interesting are the Macchiaioli (from the verb macchiare, to blotch or stain) school of Tuscan pre-Impressionists, who met at Florence's Cafe Michelangelo in the 1860s seeking a new freedom from academic art that paralleled the political liberation of the Risorgimento.",They met in the 17th century seeking a new freedom of academic art.,0,0,True,"step 1: in the premise, we have a description of the macchiaioli, a school of tuscan pre-impressionist artists who met at cafe michelangelo in the 1860s. the text also explains that they were seeking a new freedom from academic art which paralleled the political liberation of the risorgimento. step 2: the hypothesis suggests a different time frame for their meeting and intention. however, the premise itself states that they met in the 1860s, which is clearly not the 17th century. furthermore, the context given in the premise indicates a parallel between the artistic and political liberation of the time. it is historically inaccurate and illogical to suggest they sought such freedom in the 17th century. step 3: based on the information provided, the hypothesis cannot be logically inferred from the premise as it contradicts the key factual information stated in the premise."
4531,The stone was taken as booty from a Crusader church in Acre (now Israel) when it was overrun by Arab forces.,Arab forces did not take the stone from a crusader church.,0,0,True,"step 1: in the premise, it is stated that the stone was taken as booty from a crusader church when it was overrun by arab forces. this information indicates that the stone was taken from a crusader church by the arab forces during a historical event. step 2: in contrast, the hypothesis asserts that arab forces did not take the stone from a crusader church. this contradicts the information provided in the premise. step 3: therefore, based on the contradiction between the premise and hypothesis, the hypothesis is not logically entailed by the premise."
4532,"There are over 60 tombs in the valley and some still yet to be discovered dating c.1490 1100 b.c. , but not all will be open on your visit.","While initially unavailable for visit, roughly 90% of the tombs will be available after a thorough evaluation.",1,0,False,"step 1: in the premise, we have a statement about the number of tombs in the valley, with some remaining undiscovered and not all available for visit. this implies that the process of discovering and making tombs available for visit is ongoing. step 2: the hypothesis suggests that after a 'thorough evaluation', roughly 90% of the tombs will be available. this implies that the evaluation process will make a significant number of tombs accessible. step 3: the hypothesis is not directly entailed by the premise, as the premise does not guarantee that 90% of the tombs will be available after evaluation. however, if we consider common-sense reasoning and the context of archaeological sites, it is plausible that a 'thorough evaluation' would lead to the discovery and opening of a substantial number of tombs. therefore, while not logically entailed, the hypothesis is reasonable and could be a likely outcome based on the given information."
4533,"Not only must capital goods be replaced as they depreciate, but new generations of workers must be comparably",Capital goods are able to last for eternity.,0,0,True,"step 1. the premise states that capital goods must be replaced as they depreciate, which is a normal process for physical assets. this implies that capital goods do not last forever. step 2. the hypothesis suggests that capital goods are able to last for eternity, which contradicts the premise since the premise states that they do not last forever. step 3. based on the logical negation of the premise in the hypothesis, it is clear that the hypothesis is not entailed by the premise.step 4. a further explanation: the hypothesis goes against the factual information and logical connections in the premise. the premise explicitly states that capital goods must be replaced, indicating that they have a limited lifespan. the hypothesis, on the other hand, asserts that they can last forever, which is a contradiction to the premise's statement. therefore, the hypothesis is not a logical inference from the premise."
4534,These for sale? ,These aren't for sale.,0,0,True,"step 1: in the premise, the speaker is asking if something is for sale. this implies that the speaker is considering the possibility that the items in question might be available for purchase. the hypothesis states that the items are not for sale. step 2: the hypothesis contradicts the premise, as it provides a different answer to the implicit question posed in the premise. step 3: based on the logical negation of the premise's question, the hypothesis does not follow logically from the premise. in fact, the hypothesis directly contradicts the premise's underlying assumption. step 4: negations generally do not entail each other in classical logic, which is the case here. therefore, the hypothesis is not entailed by the premise."
4535,"These other professional standards are not incorporated into GAGAS, but can be used in conjunction with GAGAS.",These other professional standards are incorporated into GAGAS. ,0,0,True,"step 1: in the premise, it is stated that 'these other professional standards' are not incorporated into gagas, but they can be used in conjunction with it. this implies that gagas and these other standards operate separately. step 2: the hypothesis suggests that 'these other professional standards' are incorporated into gagas. this is a contradiction to the information given in the premise, as the premise states that they are not incorporated but only usable in conjunction. step 3: based on the logical analysis, the hypothesis cannot be inferred from the premise as it contradicts the information provided."
4536,The players at the time were allowed to keep their 4-year transfer without NCAA penalties.,The players at the time were allowed to keep their 4-year scholarships or transfer without NCAA penalties.,1,1,True,"step 1: in the premise, it is stated that players were allowed to keep their 4-year transfer without ncaa penalties. this implies that the players were allowed to transfer to another college or university with their athletic scholarships intact. the ncaa rules regarding transfers have historically focused on both the transfer itself and the potential scholarships involved. step 2: the hypothesis suggests that the players were allowed to keep their '4-year scholarships' or transfer without penalties. given the context of the premise, this hypothesis is a reasonable inference, as the premise indicates that the players were indeed allowed to keep their scholarships, as they were able to transfer with them. step 3: based on the logical connection between the premise and hypothesis, and the common sense understanding that 'transfer' in this context implies 'scholarships,' the hypothesis can be inferred from the premise."
4537,"I never saw such construction.""",The construction is incredible and very different from what we do.,1,1,True,"step 1: the premise states that the speaker 'never saw such construction' before, which implies that the construction is new and unfamiliar to the speaker. this does not directly provide information about the nature or characteristics of the construction, but it does suggest that it is different from what the speaker is accustomed to.step 2: the hypothesis describes the construction as 'incredible and very different' from what people usually do. this is consistent with the premise since the speaker found the construction to be new and unfamiliar.step 3: based on the given information, the hypothesis can be inferred from the premise as it is a logical conclusion that if a construction is new and unfamiliar, it can be described as 'incredible and very different'."
4538,"Shortly after stepping out on the bridge, Jon felt the entire walkway narrow.","Shortly after stepping out on the bridge, Jon felt the wobbly walkway narrow.",1,0,False,"step 1: in the premise, 'jon felt the entire walkway narrow' implies that the width of the walkway decreased, making it feel less stable. no specific information is given about the cause of the narrowing. step 2: in the hypothesis, 'jon felt the wobbly walkway narrow', 'wobbly' suggests instability. since the narrowing in the premise could be a cause of instability, the hypothesis is consistent with the information in the premise. step 3: the hypothesis does not logically follow from the premise, as the premise does not provide sufficient information to infer that the walkway was wobbly. however, it does not contradict the premise either, as the hypothesis is a more specific version of the narrowing described in the premise. step 4: based on the given information, there is no clear entailment relationship between the premise and the hypothesis."
4539,"Here Pollock's camouflage palette, as Varnedoe notes, gives way to carnival.",Pollock uses the camouflage palette in most of his works.,1,0,False,"step 1: in the premise, varnedo notes that pollock's camouflage palette 'gives way to carnival'. this suggests a change or transition from the use of camouflage colors in pollock's art. the premise does not specify the extent or proportion of pollock's works that use the camouflage palette. step 2: the hypothesis claims that pollock uses the camouflage palette in 'most' of his works. this is not logically entailed by the premise, as the premise only mentions a transition or change from the camouflage palette. step 3: based on the given information, the hypothesis cannot be logically inferred from the premise."
4540,"Before running away from home in Newark, N.J., to the Catholic home--known locally as the Convent--for instance, a character named Mavis allows her twin infants to smother to death in the family car.",Mavis saved her two babies from the hot car.,0,0,True,"step 1: in the premise, mavis's action of allowing her infants to smother to death in the car is presented. this is a clear contradiction to the hypothesis that she saved her babies. the premise does not provide any context or information that could reasonably lead to the hypothesis being true. step 2: the hypothesis contradicts the premise, as the actions described in each are opposite. the premise states that mavis allowed her infants to die in a car, while the hypothesis states that she saved them. step 3: based on the logical contradiction between the premise and hypothesis, it is clear that the hypothesis cannot be logically inferred from the premise."
4542,yeah uh-huh no in San Antonio it was like every day it was just a matter of who was shot that night,People shot in San Antonio are only shot with rifles or shotguns.,1,0,False,"step 1: the premise describes a situation of high crime rates and shootings in san antonio. it does not provide any specific information about the type of weapons used in these shootings. step 2: the hypothesis restricts the type of weapons used in shootings to rifles or shotguns. this hypothesis does not contradict the premise, but it also does not follow logically from it. common sense and facts suggest that various types of weapons, including handguns and explosives, can be used in shootings. step 3: based on the given information, the hypothesis is not entailed by the premise as it adds a restriction that is not necessarily true based on the information provided."
4543,i mean nine years that's incredible oh i don't know what the average is uh uh for,"We're only at five years, and it's been a struggle.",1,0,False,"step 1: in the premise, the speaker expresses surprise about someone having lived for nine years. this indicates a significant length of time. however, the premise does not provide any specific context or information about the person or situation. in the hypothesis, the speakers mention that they have only been at something for five years and found it to be a struggle. this suggests a more challenging or difficult experience than expected. step 2: the hypothesis does not logically follow from the premise because the premise does not provide enough information to infer the details of the situation described in the hypothesis. the ages mentioned in the premise and hypothesis are not directly related. step 3: based on the given information, there is no logical entailment from the premise to the hypothesis."
4544,Irishman.,He was born in Ireland.,1,1,True,"step 1: in the premise, 'irishman' is a descriptive label for a person. it implies that this person is originally from ireland. no contradictory information is provided. step 2: the hypothesis 'he was born in ireland' is a statement that logically follows the premise 'irishman'. this is because the label 'irishman' indicates that the person is from ireland, and the hypothesis states exactly that. step 3: the hypothesis is a logical entailment of the premise, as it directly describes the person in the premise and is consistent with the given information."
4546,"Linked to La Maddalena by a 7 km- (4 mile-) long causeway, the isle of Caprera was the last home of Giuseppe Garibaldi, military leader of the Risorgimento movement for Italian unity .","There is a long causeway that you can drive down, but it takes about 20 minutes.",1,1,True,"step 1: the premise states that there is a 7 km-long causeway connecting the isle of caprera to la maddalena. this causeway is significant because it is the last home of giuseppe garibaldi, an important historical figure in italian unity. step 2: the hypothesis suggests that there is a long causeway that can be driven down, but it takes about 20 minutes. the length of the causeway in the hypothesis is consistent with the length given in the premise. the time it takes to travel this distance by car is not explicitly stated in the premise, but assuming typical driving speeds, it is reasonable to infer that it would take more than 20 minutes to travel 7 km. step 3: based on the information provided, the hypothesis can be inferred from the premise. the premise establishes the existence and length of the causeway, and the hypothesis provides no contradictory information. it is reasonable to infer that driving down a long causeway takes more than 20 minutes."
4547,"The methodology included 90 interviews, observations, and data analysis from the population of 94 court districts selected purposively for their characteristics on significant variables.",We interviewed people from all of the court districts.,1,1,True,"step 1: in the premise, we have a methodology that involved conducting interviews, observations, and data analysis in 94 court districts. these districts were purposively selected based on their significant variables. step 2: the hypothesis states that 'we interviewed people from all of the court districts.' this means that every single district was involved in the interviews. step 3: the hypothesis can be logically inferred from the premise because the premise states that interviews were indeed conducted in all of the selected 94 court districts. therefore, the hypothesis is a logical consequence of the information provided in the premise.step 4: it is also worth noting that the fact that the districts were selected purposively for their significant variables does not contradict the hypothesis, as it only implies that certain characteristics made those districts particularly relevant for the study, but it does not exclude the possibility that interviews were conducted in all of them.step 5: in conclusion, based on the logical connection, the lack of contradiction, and the fact that the hypothesis follows directly from the information in the premise, the hypothesis can be inferred from the premise."
4548,Improvements in the reliability of a product's design can be measured by tracking a key reliability metric over time.,Improving product design reliability cannot be accurately measure.,0,0,True,"step 1: in the premise, it is stated that improvements in a product's design reliability can be measured by tracking a key reliability metric over time. this indicates that there is a causal relationship between the design improvements and the changes in the reliability metric. it also implies that the metric is a valid measure of design reliability.step 2: the hypothesis, 'improving product design reliability cannot be accurately measured', contradicts the premise since it asserts that the measurement of design reliability improvements is inaccurate or impossible. however, the premise itself does not provide any information or logical basis for this conclusion.step 3: there is no justification in the premise or logical principle that would allow us to infer the hypothesis. the hypothesis is not entailed by the premise.step 4: common sense reasoning suggests that the hypothesis is not valid. tracking reliability metrics is a common practice in engineering and manufacturing industries to monitor the impact of design improvements on reliability. there are numerous examples of successful design improvements that have been measured and validated using reliability metrics.therefore, the hypothesis is not logically entailed by the premise."
4549,"Taking an ecumenical tack, nation officials in Chicago recently issued edicts commanding preachers to back off their anti-Semitic rhetoric.",A good number of nation officials in Chicago are Jewish.,1,1,True,"step 1: in the premise, we have officials in chicago issuing edicts to preachers regarding their rhetoric. the specific issue is anti-semitic rhetoric. step 2: the hypothesis suggests a significant number of these officials are jewish. this information is not explicitly stated in the premise. however, there is an implication that the officials are concerned about anti-semitic rhetoric because they are jewish or represent the jewish community. this inference is made by considering the context of the situation and the common understanding of anti-semitism. step 3: while the hypothesis is not a direct entailment of the premise, it can be reasonably inferred based on the information provided and common sense understanding of the situation. step 4: the label is set to 1, as the hypothesis is a logical implication given the context and common sense reasoning."
4550,"Researchers have found fossils, similar to those in the meteorite, in some of the oldest rock on Earth.",Researchers were overjoyed with the discovery of fossils found in rocks.,1,1,True,"step 1: in the premise, the context implies that the researchers discovered fossils that were similar to those in a meteorite. the discovery of such fossils in the oldest rock on earth is significant because it suggests that life existed on earth much earlier than previously believed. the researchers' discovery of these fossils is an event that follows naturally from the described findings.step 2: the hypothesis proposes a reaction from the researchers - they were overjoyed with their discovery. this reaction is not directly stated in the premise, but it can be inferred from the context of a significant scientific discovery. the discovery of the fossils is a positive event, and it is reasonable to assume that the researchers would be excited about it.step 3: based on the logical connection between the discovery event and the researchers' reaction, the hypothesis can be inferred from the premise. the premise provides sufficient information to conclude that the researchers were overjoyed with their discovery, even though this fact is not explicitly stated."
4551,"However, this disorder is far more common within infants, and porencephaly can occur in both after birth.","However, this disorder is far more common within infants, and porencephaly can occur in both before or after birth.",1,1,True,"step 1: both the premise and hypothesis state that porencephaly is more common in infants. this commonality is a shared piece of information. step 2: the hypothesis adds an additional detail that porencephaly can occur before birth. this detail does not contradict the premise because the premise does not restrict the occurrence of porencephaly to after birth. step 3: the hypothesis can be logically inferred from the premise with the additional detail serving as an expansion of the known information. the hypothesis does not contradict the premise, and it can be reasonably inferred from it."
4552,and going to school is also always very prohibitive now unless your parents are wealthy,Wealthy parents are necessary for school.,1,1,True,"step 1: in the premise, it is stated that going to school is very prohibitive now for most people unless their parents are wealthy. this implies that the financial situation of the parents plays a significant role in determining if a person can attend school.step 2: the hypothesis 'wealthy parents are necessary for school' is a direct consequence of the information provided in the premise. if going to school requires wealth, then having wealthy parents is a necessary condition for school attendance.step 3: based on the logical connection between the premise and hypothesis, and the absence of contradictory information, the hypothesis can be inferred from the premise."
4553,"You see, Tuppence, he observed.","You recognize it, Tuppence, he observed.",1,1,True,"step 1: the premise is a quote from an agatha christie novel, spoken by a character named hercule poirot. it implies that hercule poirot is observing something carefully and sharing his observations with tuppence. the word 'it' in the hypothesis is ambiguous and can refer to any number of things that hercule poirot might be observing. the phrase 'you recognize' suggests that tuppence has previously encountered or knows something related to the observation.step 2: the hypothesis can be logically inferred from the premise because 'recognize' implies a prior knowledge or familiarity with the observation. it is a reasonable assumption that hercule poirot's observation and tuppence's recognition of it are related. the hypothesis does not contradict the premise and is consistent with it.step 3: based on the logical connection between observation and recognition, the hypothesis can be inferred from the premise."
4554,It is likely that future secretaries of state will say that the formative experience of their lives was Kosovo.,Future secretaries of state will not remember Kosovo.,0,0,True,"step 1: in the premise, it is suggested that future secretaries of state will describe kosovo as a formative experience of their lives. this implies that they will recall and mention kosovo in their biographies or public statements. step 2: the hypothesis states that future secretaries of state will not remember kosovo. this contradicts the premise, as remembering and not remembering are opposite actions. step 3: based on the logical negation of the premise and the lack of any justification or context in the hypothesis to make it entailed, the hypothesis is not logically inferred from the premise."
4555,"(Related  Pundit Central once called the president Schmucko and got bushels of harsh mail, some from his own mother and aunt.",Pundit Central only received praise for calling the president Schmucko.,0,0,True,"step 1: in the premise, it is mentioned that pundit central called the president schmucko and received harsh mail in response. the information does not specify the nature or sentiment of the mail before or after the harsh mail. it is also not stated whether there was any praise or positive feedback mentioned at all. common sense and logic do not dictate that harsh mail is the only type of response to such a statement.step 2: the hypothesis suggests that pundit central only received praise for calling the president schmucko. however, the premise does not provide any evidence or logical connection to support this hypothesis. in fact, the premise explicitly states that there was harsh mail, which contradicts the hypothesis.step 3: based on the logical reasoning, common sense, and the information provided in the premise, the hypothesis is not entailed. the premise does not support the hypothesis, as it mentions harsh mail, which contradicts the hypothesis of only receiving praise."
4556,"By one estimate, Russia's economic output would more than double if the Russians simply sold off their natural resources instead of trying to make something out of them.",The Russians are not in a position to make money on the world market no matter what they do. ,0,0,True,"step 1: in the premise, it is suggested that russia's economic output would more than double if they sold off their natural resources instead of trying to make something out of them. this implies that russia's natural resources have significant value in the world market. however, it does not indicate that russia is incapable of making money from activities other than selling natural resources.step 2: the hypothesis proposes a general statement about russia's inability to make money in the world market, which is not explicitly stated or logically implied in the premise. while the premise discusses one potential source of revenue, it does not negate the possibility of other profitable activities.step 3: based on the information provided, the hypothesis cannot be logically inferred from the premise. the premise suggests that selling natural resources would significantly improve russia's economic output, but it does not indicate that they would be unable to make money from other sources."
4557,and the same is true of the drug hangover you know if you,It's just like a drug hangover.,1,1,True,"step 1: both the premise and hypothesis are referring to a 'drug' experience, with the premise describing a specific type of drug experience as being 'the same' for someone. the hypothesis makes a comparison by stating that something is 'just like' a drug hangover. step 2: the comparison in the hypothesis can be inferred from the premise because the premise establishes that the speaker's experience with the drug is identical to another experience they've had, which is being described as a drug hangover. step 3: based on the logical connection between the premise and hypothesis, and the lack of contradictory information, the hypothesis can be inferred from the premise."
4558,One night I sat on top of the rock watching the blood moon rise.,I watched the blood moon set.,0,0,True,"step 1: the premise describes an action where 'i sat on top of the rock' and an event 'watching the blood moon rise'. a blood moon is the result of a total lunar eclipse, which occurs when the moon is on the opposite side of the earth from the sun and passes through the earth's umbral shadow. this event makes the moon appear red. step 2: 'watching the blood moon set' contradicts the premise as watching the moon set would imply that the moon is on the horizon, not rising. additionally, a blood moon can only be observed during the rising or early part of the night. step 3: based on the given information, logical principles, and common-sense reasoning, the hypothesis 'i watched the blood moon set' is not entailed by the premise 'one night i sat on top of the rock watching the blood moon rise'."
4559,Harrison began his career in the 1970s.,Harrison began his career in the 1970s and has written over 300 major-label recorded songs including several number-one hits.,1,1,True,"step 1: in the premise, it is stated that harrison began his career in the 1970s. this information establishes a fact about harrison's professional background. there is no contradictory information provided in the premise.step 2: the hypothesis adds additional information, stating that harrison has written over 300 major-label recorded songs including several number-one hits. the premise does not contradict this information. in fact, knowing that harrison began his career in the 1970s does not exclude the possibility that he wrote a large number of songs and had some number-one hits.step 3: the hypothesis can be seen as an extension or elaboration of the premise, providing more details about harrison's career. the premise establishes a fact, and the hypothesis adds additional facts that are consistent with the premise.therefore, the hypothesis can be logically inferred from the premise as it is a reasonable extension of the information provided."
4560,"As for me, I'm going to make some French toast.",Nobody has decided to make French toast as a dish.,0,0,True,"step 1: in the premise, the speaker is stating their intention to make french toast. this statement is about their personal plan or action. step 2: the hypothesis is stating a general fact about a decision that 'nobody' has made. these statements are not directly related to each other. it is important to note that the premise only describes the speaker's actions, it does not provide any information about the actions or decisions of others. step 3: based on this reasoning, the hypothesis is not logically entailed by the premise."
4561,"William Powell and Myrna Loy star, a reminder of the time when classy (if drunken) wit equalled box-office success.",William Powell and Myrna Loy occasionally drank vodka on the set of their films. ,1,0,False,"step 1: the premise mentions william powell and myrna loy as actors who were successful due to their classy wit, but it does not provide any direct information about their drinking habits. however, the phrase 'if drunken' suggests a possible connection to alcohol. step 2: the hypothesis proposes that william powell and myrna loy occasionally drank vodka on the set of their films. this hypothesis does not contradict the premise but might align with it, as the premise mentions a 'classy' yet 'drunken' atmosphere, which could be associated with the consumption of alcohol. step 3: while the premise does not directly infer or entail the hypothesis, the possibility of a connection between the mentioned 'drunken' atmosphere and the hypothesis of occasional vodka consumption is plausible. given the context and lack of contradictory information, the hypothesis can be considered a reasonable inference or implication from the premise."
4562,"For something different, try dorada a la a whole fish is packed in wet salt, then baked.","If you want something different, try the spaghetti. ",0,0,True,"step 1: in the premise, a recommendation is given for trying something different using dorada a la salada, which is a whole fish packed in wet salt and then baked. this describes a dish and the method of preparing it. in the hypothesis, a suggestion is made to try spaghetti. these are two different dishes.step 2: the hypothesis does not logically follow or can be inferred from the premise. the premise suggests cooking and trying a new fish dish, while the hypothesis suggests trying a completely different type of food, spaghetti.step 3: based on the logical analysis, the hypothesis cannot be inferred from the premise as they describe different dishes."
4563,"'Wait here,' I was ordered.",He told me to wait until he opened the gate.,1,1,True,"step 1: the premise indicates a directive to wait at a specific location. this could be due to various reasons, such as waiting for someone or something. it does not provide any explicit information about who gave the order or why. step 2: the hypothesis suggests that the person giving the order to wait wanted me to stay put until a certain event happened (opening the gate). this is a reasonable inference, as it provides a potential explanation for why i was ordered to wait in the first place. step 3: based on the given information and common sense reasoning, the hypothesis 'he told me to wait until he opened the gate' can be logically inferred from the premise 'i was ordered to wait here'."
4564,A lady wearing a red and white polka dot swim cap is swimming in a pool.,Woman sits on the sidelines of a basketball game.,0,0,True,"step 1: the premise describes a scene where a lady is swimming in a pool, and the swim cap she's wearing is red and white with polka dots. no additional information about her activities or location outside of the pool is provided. step 2: the hypothesis suggests a completely different scenario involving a woman sitting on the sidelines of a basketball game. there is no logical connection or common sense reasoning that can be applied to infer the hypothesis from the premise. in fact, they contradict each other, as swimming in a pool is incompatible with sitting on the sidelines of a basketball game. step 3: based on the logical analysis and the contradictory nature of the premise and hypothesis, it is clear that the hypothesis cannot be inferred from the premise."
4565,"Don't you even have a guess?  Bork answered shortly, ""No."" He looked worried, Dave thought, and guessed that even the fanatics were not quite sure they _wanted_ to be hatched.",The fanatics were bad people.,1,0,False,"step 1: in the premise, bork, who is among the fanatics, expresses uncertainty about being hatched. dave interprets this uncertainty as a sign of unease or discomfort, suggesting that the fanatics might not be happy or desirable entities. however, the premise itself does not directly label the fanatics as 'bad people'. step 2: the hypothesis goes beyond the given information in the premise by making a definitive statement about the moral character of the fanatics. while the premise implies that they might not be desirable or pleasant, it does not entail that they are 'bad people'. step 3: based on the given information and logical reasoning, the hypothesis cannot be logically inferred from the premise."
4566,"Turn right at the end down Via Cappello for the 13th-century palazzo that the local tourist authorities will have you believe was Juliet's House (Casa di Giulietta Cappelletti), complete with balcony.",Juliet did not really live in the palazzo.,1,0,False,"step 1: the premise describes a location, via cappello, which is associated with a palazzo that is believed by local tourist authorities to have been juliet's house. the premise does not provide any direct evidence that juliet actually lived there. step 2: the hypothesis suggests that juliet did not live in the palazzo. this contradicts the belief stated in the premise. however, it is important to note that the premise only states that this is a belief held by local tourist authorities, not a fact. step 3: based on the information provided, it cannot be logically inferred that the hypothesis is entailed by the premise. in fact, the premise explicitly leaves open the possibility that juliet did not live in the palazzo, which is exactly what the hypothesis asserts."
4567,They assassinate kings and queens in their beds with a thousand guards surrounding the room.,Kings and queens never get murdered when surrounded by guards. ,0,0,True,"step 1: in the premise, it is stated that kings and queens are assassinated in their beds despite having a thousand guards. this implies that the presence of guards does not prevent assassinations from occurring. common sense and historical facts suggest that while guards can deter some assassination attempts, they cannot absolutely guarantee complete safety. they can only increase the level of security. step 2: the hypothesis, 'kings and queens never get murdered when surrounded by guards,' contradicts the information in the premise. the hypothesis asserts that guards always prevent murders, which is not logically consistent with the premise. step 3: based on the logical reasoning and factual inconsistency, the hypothesis is not entailed by the premise."
4568,It would be unnecessary to have two cars waiting about.,It is imperative that I have two cars waiting for me. ,0,0,True,"step 1: in the premise, it is stated that having two cars waiting is unnecessary. unnecessary implies an absence of need or requirement. step 2: in contrast, the hypothesis states that it is imperative or absolutely necessary for you to have two cars waiting. these statements directly contradict each other. there is no logical connection between the premise and hypothesis based on the given information. step 3: the hypothesis cannot be inferred from the premise as they state opposite requirements."
4569,A cute puppy fetches a yellow ring chew toy in the yard.,A puppy plays fetch.,1,1,True,"step 1: in the premise, the action of the puppy 'fetches a yellow ring chew toy' is described. fetch is a common term used to describe a game where a dog retrieves an object, typically thrown by a person. the verb 'fetches' itself suggests the dog is playing fetch. step 2: the hypothesis 'a puppy plays fetch' can be logically inferred from the premise since the premise already states that 'a puppy fetches'. the hypothesis is a more general statement that includes the specific action described in the premise. step 3: based on the logical connection between the premise and hypothesis, and the absence of contradictory information, the hypothesis can be inferred from the premise."
4570,I Know He Grabbed Her,He grabbed her and threw her to the floor.,1,0,False,"step 1: the premise 'i know he grabbed her' implies that someone has physically seized another person. there's no specific information about what happened after the grab. in the hypothesis 'he grabbed her and threw her to the floor', the action 'threw her to the floor' indicates a further action, which could logically follow 'grabbed her'. step 2: the hypothesis is not an exact inference from the premise as it adds the information 'and threw her to the floor'. however, this additional information does not contradict the premise, as 'grabbed' implies a physical contact that could lead to 'throwing'. common sense and the lack of contradictory facts suggest that the hypothesis could be a possible continuation of the events described in the premise. step 3: based on the logical reasoning, the lack of contradiction, and the plausibility of the hypothesis as a possible continuation of the events described in the premise, it is reasonable to assume that the hypothesis could be true given the premise."
4571,"The Throne Room is one of a series of apartments built during the reign of Charles II, though it was originally designed as a guard room that screened entrants to the private chambers beyond.",The Throne Room is an apartment built during the reign of George III.,0,0,True,"step 1: in the premise, we learn that the throne room is an apartment built during the reign of charles ii, but it was originally designed as a guard room. step 2: the hypothesis proposes that the throne room was built during the reign of george iii. however, the premise clearly contradicts the hypothesis, as the throne room was not built during the reign of george iii but during the reign of charles ii. step 3: given this contradiction, it is not possible for the hypothesis to be logically inferred from the premise."
4572,i think they recognize their their position as a community leader,They have no idea that they are the community leader.,0,0,True,"step 1: the premise suggests that the individuals involved have a self-awareness or understanding of their role within their community as a leader. this implies recognition and acceptance of the responsibilities and influence that come with being a community leader.step 2: the hypothesis states that they have no idea they are the community leader. this means they lack the self-awareness or understanding of their position.step 3: the hypothesis contradicts the premise as the actions or states described in the hypothesis are not logically entailed by the premise. the premise implies knowledge or recognition of the leadership role, whereas the hypothesis implies a lack of such knowledge.step 4: based on the logical analysis, the hypothesis cannot be inferred from the premise as the two statements are contradictory."
4573,"However, some of them indicated that certain IT practices (e.g.",The indicated practices were all recorded.,1,0,False,"step 1: in the premise, 'some of them indicated' implies that there are individuals or groups who communicated certain information. the specific information mentioned is 'that certain it practices were indicated'. however, the premise does not provide any detail about how, when, or where these indications were made, or about the form they took. for example, the indications could have been verbal, written, or some other means.step 2: the hypothesis, 'the indicated practices were all recorded', suggests that there exists a complete and written record of the indicated it practices. while the premise does not contradict this hypothesis, it does not entail it either. the absence of contradiction does not automatically imply entailment.step 3: based on the given information, the hypothesis cannot be logically inferred from the premise. the premise does not provide enough detail to support the hypothesis that all indicated practices were recorded."
4574,It shows clearly enough that my poor old friend had just found out she'd been made a fool of!,I was relieved that my friend was feeling so well and happy.,0,0,True,"step 1: in the premise, the speaker indicates that they have just learned their friend had been made a fool of, which implies that the friend is feeling upset or distressed. this is a common reaction to discovering one has been deceived or humiliated.step 2: in contrast, the hypothesis describes the speaker's relief that their friend is feeling 'so well and happy.' this contradicts the premise, as relief is typically not an emotion expressed or expected when someone discovers they have been made a fool of.step 3: based on the given information, the hypothesis cannot be logically inferred from the premise, as the emotions described in the premise and hypothesis are not consistent with each other."
4575,you know it's it's not easy to do but,It's worth it in the end.,1,0,False,"step 1: in the premise, the speaker acknowledges that doing 'it' is not easy. however, 'it' is not specified, so the context and meaning of the difficulty are unknown. in the hypothesis, the speaker expresses a belief that the end result is worth the effort. step 2: while the hypothesis cannot be logically inferred from the premise because the premise does not provide enough context to make a definitive connection, the hypothesis is a common expression often used to encourage perseverance and optimism in the face of challenges. step 3: based on common sense and the context of motivational speech, the hypothesis can be seen as a reasonable inference or implication of the premise, as the idea of something being worth the effort can provide motivation to overcome the acknowledged difficulty."
4576,"At the very least, Flytrap illustrates the need for less fact chasing and more analysis and illumination of the what should we do about it question.",Flytrap has taught many people a few valuable lessons.,1,1,True,"step 1: in the premise, 'flytrap illustrates the need for less fact chasing and more analysis and illumination of the what should we do about it question.', the author is expressing that flytrap serves as an example for the importance of analyzing and addressing the consequences or actions to be taken, rather than just gathering facts. this implies that flytrap has some sort of instructive value.step 2: the hypothesis, 'flytrap has taught many people a few valuable lessons', directly relates to the premise as it also highlights the instructive value or impact of flytrap. the hypothesis is a logical conclusion that can be inferred from the premise, as the premise implies that flytrap has had a beneficial effect on people by teaching them something.step 3: based on the logical connection between the premise and hypothesis, and the absence of contradictory information, the hypothesis can be inferred from the premise."
4577,but i don't know that's the bad thing there is that we spent so much money or you would spend so much money trying to keep a large lawn alive that was the only thing i didn't like about lawns and we were sitting there wondering there must be a better way to landscape so that you don't have to spend so much money trying to keep the lawn alive and green and the weeds out,The lawn is very beautiful as we have kept it nice.,1,0,False,"step 1: in the premise, the speaker mentions that they don't like spending a lot of money on maintaining a large lawn, as they find it unnecessary due to the constant need to keep it alive and weed-free. step 2: the hypothesis, on the other hand, states that the lawn is beautiful. however, neither the premise nor the hypothesis explicitly state or imply that the speaker or others find the lawn to be unattractive or ugly. step 3: it is important to note that the speaker's opinion about the monetary aspect of maintaining a lawn does not logically entail a conclusion about the lawn's appearance. a lawn can be expensive to maintain and still be visually appealing. therefore, the hypothesis cannot be logically inferred from the premise. step 4: in fact, the premise and hypothesis seem to be contradictory only if we make an unwarranted assumption that the speaker's negative feelings about the financial cost of maintaining the lawn mean that they must also feel that the lawn is unattractive. but there is no evidence to support this assumption. step 5: in conclusion, the hypothesis that 'the lawn is very beautiful as we have kept it nice' is not logically entailed by the premise."
4579,Two girls are on a street sidewalk and one is sitting.,girls are on the sidewalk,1,1,True,"step 1: in the premise, it is stated that two girls are on a street sidewalk, and one is sitting. this information provides a clear context about the location and number of girls. there is no contradictory information or logical inconsistency in the premise. step 2: the hypothesis, 'girls are on the sidewalk', is identical to the premise. since the hypothesis is a restatement of the premise, it can be logically inferred. step 3: the hypothesis is a direct entailment of the premise as they both describe the same situation."
4580,Your voice was so queer!,Your voice was quite normal.,0,0,True,"step 1: the premise describes the speaker finding the other person's voice 'queer' or unusual. this observation is subjective and does not provide any objective information about the voice's characteristics. common sense suggests that 'quite normal' is the opposite of 'queer' or unusual, but a normal voice may still vary among individuals. step 2: the hypothesis, 'your voice was quite normal', cannot be logically inferred from the premise as the opposite of 'queer' does not necessarily mean 'normal' in this context. instead, it could mean that the voice was not unusually high, low, or otherwise distinctive. step 3: based on the given information, the hypothesis is not entailed by the premise."
4582,"Yes, ma'am. Tuppence was ushered into a room on the right of the long passage.",Tuppence reluctantly agreed. ,1,0,False,"step 1: in the premise, tuppence is ushered into a room. this is a clear statement about an action taken towards tuppence. there is no information about tuppence's agreement or reluctance in the premise.step 2: the hypothesis 'tuppence reluctantly agreed' does not logically follow from the premise. while there is no contradiction, the hypothesis adds information that is not present in the premise. thus, the hypothesis is not entailed by the premise.step 3: based on the given information, the hypothesis cannot be logically inferred from the premise."
4583,"It will have to cut other spending, raise other taxes or, more likely, sell other bonds to the public--that is, run a big budget deficit.",Education spending will be cut.,1,1,True,"step 1: the premise suggests that the government is facing a financial situation where it needs to reduce spending, increase taxes, or sell bonds to cover a budget deficit. step 2: the hypothesis proposes that education spending will be cut. this is a reasonable inference from the premise because running a big budget deficit implies that not all spending areas will be spared from cuts. education spending is one of the common areas for budget cuts during fiscal crises. step 3: based on the logical reasoning and common sense understanding of budget deficits and the typical response of governments during such situations, the hypothesis can be inferred from the premise."
4584,"But attacking the problem requires a strategy appropriate to the organization involved and its particular risks, including a consideration of the legal requirements surrounding security and privacy issues.",The same attacking strategy can be used for all organizations.,0,0,True,"step 1: in the premise, it is stated that the problem-solving strategy for an organization must consider the organization's specific risks, legal requirements, and its unique characteristics. this implies that different strategies are needed for different organizations due to their unique contexts. step 2: the hypothesis states that a single strategy can be used for all organizations. this directly contradicts the premise, as the hypothesis disregards the need for a tailored strategy based on an organization's specific risks and legal requirements. step 3: based on the logical inconsistency between the premise and hypothesis, the hypothesis cannot be logically inferred from the premise."
4585,"Julius wired to town for his own car, and they scoured the neighbourhood daily with unflagging zeal.",Julius wired to town for a special black car. ,1,1,True,"step 1: in the premise, 'julius wired to town for his own car' implies julius made arrangements for the acquisition of a car. 'scoured the neighborhood daily with unflagging zeal' suggests an intense search for this car. no contradictory information is given that would conflict with the hypothesis.step 2: the hypothesis 'julius wired to town for a special black car' is consistent with the premise as 'his own car' could reasonably be interpreted as a 'special' car, especially when no color is mentioned in the premise. the hypothesis is not a direct logical consequence of the premise, but it is a plausible inference given the context.step 3: based on the context and common sense, the hypothesis can be inferred from the premise, as it does not contradict the given information and is a reasonable assumption within the context of the premise."
4586, Dave looked up obediently.,Dave looked up happily.,0,0,True,"step 1: the premise states that dave looked up. this action could have various reasons behind it. it doesn't provide any information about dave's emotional state. common sense and logical principles do not dictate a specific emotional state based on the given action.step 2: the hypothesis suggests dave looked up happily. while it's possible for someone to look up happily, there's no inherent logical connection between the two actions. looking up obediently and looking up happily are distinct actions.step 3: based on the given information, the hypothesis cannot be logically inferred from the premise. the premise does not provide enough information to conclude that dave was happy when he looked up."
4587,"The local population of St. Elizabeth Parish still makes a living from fishing, and their wooden boats rest high on the dark, volcanic sand.",The boats that the people use for fishing cannot touch the sand.,0,0,True,"step 1: in the premise, it is mentioned that the boats rest 'high' on the sand. the term 'rest' implies that the boats are not in contact with the water, but rather, they are on the sand. however, the premise also states that the local population makes a living from fishing, which requires boats to touch the water to be effective. this creates a potential contradiction. step 2: the hypothesis, 'the boats that the people use for fishing cannot touch the sand,' would explain this apparent contradiction. if the boats cannot touch the sand, then they would need to be in the water at all times, resolving the apparent contradiction. step 3: however, the premise also states that the boats 'rest' on the sand, which indicates that they do indeed come into contact with the sand at some point. therefore, the hypothesis cannot be logically inferred from the premise, as it contradicts the information provided in the premise about the boats coming into contact with the sand."
4588,uh-huh that sounds like an interesting concept,"It seems to be an interesting, yet expensive, idea.  ",1,0,False,"step 1: both the premise and hypothesis express that the concept being discussed is interesting. no specific logical connections can be drawn from the given information. however, the hypothesis adds the additional information that the concept is expensive. step 2: the hypothesis 'it seems to be an interesting, yet expensive, idea' is not logically inferred from the premise 'that sounds like an interesting concept'. the hypothesis introduces a new concept, 'expensive', which is not mentioned in or deducible from the premise. step 3: based on the given information, the hypothesis is not logically entailed by the premise."
4589,The streets are busy and people contemplate their futures.,People are thinking about futures.,1,1,True,"step 1: in the premise, it is stated that 'people contemplate their futures'. contemplating or thinking about something is a mental process related to the concept of 'futures'. step 2: the hypothesis, 'people are thinking about futures', is identical in meaning to the premise. therefore, the hypothesis is a logical consequence of the premise. step 3: based on the logical identity of the hypothesis and the premise, the hypothesis is logically entailed by the premise."
4590,They comprise one of the most interesting formations of Balkan vegetation types as the forests are of striking beauty.,They comprise one of the most interesting formations of Balkan vegetation types as the forests bear several rare plants and are of striking beauty.,1,1,True,"step 1: in the premise, 'they comprise one of the most interesting formations of balkan vegetation types' is a statement about the unique and noteworthy nature of certain balkan forests. the phrase 'as the forests are of striking beauty' provides an explanation for their interest. step 2: the hypothesis introduces the presence of rare plants in the forests, but it does not contradict the information in the premise. instead, it adds further details about the reasons for the forests' interest. step 3: given that the hypothesis does not contradict the premise and adds details that further explain the reasons for the forests' interest, it can be reasonably inferred from the premise.step 4: the hypothesis can be seen as a more specific or elaborated version of the premise, as it provides an additional reason for the forests' interest (the presence of rare plants).therefore, the hypothesis can be inferred from the premise based on logical consistency, common-sense reasoning, and the relationship between the hypothesis and the premise as more specific or elaborated versions of each other."
4591,Here is a picture of a woman and her husband in their car smiling and waving.,Here is a picture of a woman and her husband',1,1,True,"step 1: in the premise, there is a description of a picture that shows a woman and her husband in their car, smiling and waving. the hypothesis is identical in content to the premise, only presented as a separate statement. step 2: since the hypothesis is identical in meaning to the premise, it logically follows or is entailed by the premise. the hypothesis can be inferred directly from the premise. step 3: given the logical equivalence and the absence of contradictory information, the hypothesis is entailed by the premise."
4592,Three children in swimsuites are having fun outside near a white building.,Some children outside having fun and playing.,1,1,True,"step 1: in the premise, we have the information that there are three children in swimsuits having fun outside a white building. this implies that the children are engaging in some form of recreational activity, likely playing. step 2: the hypothesis 'some children outside having fun and playing' can be logically inferred from the premise since it is a more general version of the information provided in the premise. the hypothesis covers not only the three children mentioned in the premise but also any other children who might be having fun outside. step 3: based on the logical reasoning, the hypothesis can be inferred from the premise."
4593,They ripped him apart.,He remained intact.,0,0,True,"step 1: the premise indicates an action where 'they' (unspecified subjects) ripped 'him' apart. this implies a violent dismemberment or destruction of the person or object referred to as 'him'. step 2: the hypothesis states that 'he remained intact', which is the opposite of being ripped apart. it suggests that 'he' was not harmed or damaged in any way. step 3: the hypothesis directly contradicts the premise, as the statements are logically incompatible. it is not possible for both the premise and hypothesis to be true at the same time. step 4: given the clear contradiction between the premise and hypothesis, the hypothesis cannot be inferred from the premise."
4594,Consider a program of discounts for presortation.,You should consider a program for discounts for presortation and access.,1,1,True,"step 1: in the premise, a program for discounts for presortation is mentioned. presortation refers to the arrangement of mail in a particular order before it is sent out for delivery. this process can help reduce postal costs. no contradictory information is provided in the premise that would disallow the hypothesis.step 2: the hypothesis suggests an extension of the premise, implying the inclusion of 'access' in the program. presortation is a process that can be facilitated with proper access to certain resources or tools. for instance, having access to advanced sorting equipment or software can make presortation more efficient. therefore, the hypothesis can be seen as a logical extension of the premise.step 3: based on the information provided and logical reasoning, the hypothesis can be inferred from the premise as it is a reasonable extension of the given scenario."
4595,"After shuttering the DOE, Clinton could depict himself as a crusader against waste and bureaucracy who succeeded where even Reagan failed.",Reagan had tried to shutter the DOE but was unable to.,1,1,True,"step 1: in the premise, clinton's ability to shutter the doe and be seen as a crusader against waste and bureaucracy is dependent on the historical context that reagan had also attempted to shutter the doe but was unsuccessful. this implies that reagan's failure was a significant factor in making clinton's success noteworthy.step 2: the hypothesis asserts that reagan indeed tried to shutter the doe but was unsuccessful. this hypothesis directly relates to the premise and can be logically inferred from it, as the premise implies that reagan's failure was a necessary condition for clinton's successful depiction.step 3: based on the logical connection between the premise and hypothesis, and the absence of contradictory facts, the hypothesis can be inferred from the premise."
4596,Then he screamed suddenly.,He screamed in sudden pain.,1,1,True,"step 1: in the premise, 'he' screamed suddenly. this indicates an unexpected and loud utterance. no specific reason for the screaming is given. step 2: the hypothesis suggests that 'he' screamed in sudden pain. this implies that there was a cause for the sudden screaming, which was the experience of pain. step 3: the hypothesis is a reasonable inference from the premise because the unexpected nature of the screaming in the premise leaves open the possibility that it could have been due to pain. pain is a common cause of sudden screaming. thus, the hypothesis is a valid logical inference from the premise. step 4: based on the logical reasoning and the plausibility of the inference, the hypothesis is entailed by the premise."
4597,"'I don't know what happened, exactly.' I said.",I knew what had happened.,0,0,True,"step 1: the premise indicates uncertainty on the speaker's part about the specifics of the event. no specific information about the event or the speaker's knowledge is provided. step 2: the hypothesis contradicts the premise by stating that the speaker did know what had happened. step 3: given the information provided, the hypothesis cannot be logically inferred from the premise. the premise does not contain any information that would support the hypothesis, and the hypothesis contradicts the explicit statement in the premise."
4598,dress shorts yeah yeah,"Blouses, jackets, of course...",0,0,True,"step 1: the premise 'dress shorts yeah yeah' is vague and does not contain any explicit or logical connections to the hypothesis 'blouses, jackets, of course...' step 2: the hypothesis does not seem to be logically entailed by the premise, as there is no mention of blouses or jackets in the premise. step 3: based on the lack of logical connection and the absence of explicit or implicit information in the premise that would allow the hypothesis to be logically inferred, the hypothesis is not entailed by the premise."
4610,They were peaceful and lived by  slash-and-burn  farming.,They were one of the most technologically advanced cultures at the time.,0,0,True,"step 1: in the premise, 'they were peaceful and lived by slash-and-burn farming' describes a community that practiced a method of agriculture where they cleared land by burning it for cultivation. this information does not provide any indication of the technological advancement of the culture. step 2: the hypothesis 'they were one of the most technologically advanced cultures at the time' is a contradiction to the premise as slash-and-burn farming is not associated with advanced technology but rather a simple agricultural practice. step 3: based on the logical analysis, the hypothesis is not entailed by the premise."
4633,so what about your income tax think they're hitting you too hard,Your income tax is very reasonable.,0,0,True,"step 1: in the premise, the speaker expresses a concern or question about the fairness of their income tax. this implies that they believe the tax may be too high. step 2: the hypothesis directly contradicts the premise, stating that the income tax is reasonable. contradictory statements cannot be logically inferred from each other. step 3: based on the given information, there is no logical entailment between the premise and hypothesis. in fact, they are opposites."
4638,A young woman wearing a white cardigan and shorts sitting on the edge of a platform that is raised above a body of water.,The woman is taking a shower.,0,0,True,"step 1: in the premise, a young woman is described as sitting on a raised platform above a body of water while wearing a white cardigan and shorts. the raised platform and the body of water suggest a possible setting for a shower, but the premise does not explicitly state that the woman is taking a shower. common sense and logical analysis do not directly infer that taking a shower is the only or even a typical activity one can do in such a setting. however, wearing a cardigan and shorts is an unusual choice for taking a shower, as most people prefer to take showers wearing only towels or bathing suits. this inconsistency raises doubts about the hypothesis.step 2: the hypothesis, 'the woman is taking a shower,' cannot be logically inferred from the premise because the premise does not provide sufficient evidence to support this claim. the woman's attire and her location do not conclusively prove that she is taking a shower.step 3: based on the logical reasoning, common sense, and the lack of sufficient evidence, the hypothesis is not entailed by the premise."
4647,"Unfortunately, much of the temple lies in ruins.",The temple was destroyed by a major earthquake.  ,1,0,False,"step 1: in the premise, it is stated that 'much of the temple lies in ruins.' this indicates that a significant portion of the temple has been damaged or destroyed. the cause of this destruction is not explicitly mentioned in the premise. step 2: the hypothesis suggests that 'a major earthquake' was the cause of the temple's destruction. earthquakes are known to cause extensive damage to structures, often resulting in ruins. step 3: although the premise does not mention an earthquake as the cause of the temple's destruction, the hypothesis is consistent with the information provided in the premise. the hypothesis can be considered a reasonable explanation for the state of the temple described in the premise. step 4: while the hypothesis is not logically entailed by the premise, it is a plausible inference based on common knowledge of natural disasters and their effects on structures. step 5: given the information in the premise, the hypothesis 'the temple was destroyed by a major earthquake' is a reasonable inference, even though it is not a logical entailment."
4650,Four girls look at objects under a microscope.,Four boys look at objects under a microscope.,0,0,True,"step 1: the premise describes a scene where four girls observe objects through a microscope. this situation involves the girls looking at small items with magnified vision. no logical inconsistencies or contradictory facts are present. step 2: the hypothesis proposes a scenario where four boys look at objects under a microscope. this situation parallels the premise, as it also involves individuals examining objects using a microscope. however, the hypothesis contradicts the premise based on the given information because it suggests that the individuals involved are boys instead of girls. step 3: based on the logical analysis, the hypothesis 'four boys look at objects under a microscope' cannot be logically inferred from the premise 'four girls look at objects under a microscope'. the hypothesis contradicts the premise by introducing a different gender for the subjects."
4654,you know because it takes longer than some products some other foods in your stomach to digest that meat,All food products take the same time to digest.,0,0,True,"step 1: in the premise, it is stated that meat takes longer than some other food products to digest. this implies that there is variation in the time it takes for different food products to digest. step 2: the hypothesis, however, asserts that all food products take the same time to digest. this directly contradicts the premise, as the premise establishes that there are differences in digestion times. step 3: based on the logical analysis, the hypothesis 'all food products take the same time to digest' cannot be inferred from the premise 'you know because it takes longer than some products some other foods in your stomach to digest that meat'."
4668,"They spent a couple of minutes chatting, before heading off toward the town's main road.",They were not in a hurry to go anywhere and leisurely walked. ,1,1,True,"step 1: the premise describes an action (chatting) that took a certain amount of time (a couple of minutes), followed by another action (heading off). the time spent chatting does not necessarily imply a sense of urgency or rushing. in fact, the phrase 'before heading off' can be seen as an indication that they may have been taking their time. step 2: the hypothesis suggests that 'they were not in a hurry to go anywhere' and 'leisurely walked'. this interpretation is consistent with the information in the premise, as the premise does not indicate any sense of urgency or rushing in their actions. step 3: based on the logical reasoning, the lack of contradictory information in the premise, and the common-sense understanding of the situation, the hypothesis can be inferred from the premise."
4671,Her life would never be normal but it would be as good a life as they could give her.,Her life was very typical.,0,0,True,"step 1: in the premise, it is stated that her life would never be normal, indicating an unusual or non-standard life. no specific information is provided about what makes her life 'as good as they could give her'. step 2: the hypothesis, 'her life was very typical', directly contradicts the premise. a typical life is one that conforms to the usual or expected pattern, while the premise states that her life deviates from the norm. therefore, the hypothesis cannot be logically inferred from the premise. step 3: based on the logical contradiction between the premise and hypothesis, the hypothesis is not entailed by the premise."
4722,well that's a novel idea yeah that would cause you think a little while wouldn't it,It's a cliche idea ,0,0,True,"step 1: in the premise, the speaker is expressing that the idea being discussed is novel and thought-provoking. this implies that the idea is not common or conventional. step 2: the hypothesis states that the idea is a cliche, which is the opposite of novel. however, there is not enough information provided in the premise to logically infer that the idea is a cliche. cliches are ideas or expressions that have become overused and common. sometimes novel ideas can become cliches over time, but this is not necessarily the case. step 3: based on the given information, the hypothesis 'it's a cliche idea' cannot be logically inferred from the premise 'well that's a novel idea yeah that would cause you think a little while wouldn't it'."
4769,real true that uh you you know they'll say one thing to get elected and then once they do get elected they don't have the power or the authority or the willingness to do those things that they promised you know beforehand,They do the things they promised to do.,0,0,True,"step 1: in the premise, it is suggested that politicians make promises to get elected, but often lack the power, authority, or willingness to fulfill those promises once elected. this implies a common occurrence of broken promises in politics.step 2: the hypothesis states that politicians do the things they promised to do. this contradicts the premise, as it suggests an inconsistency or reversal of the usual pattern.step 3: based on logical principles and common sense reasoning, the hypothesis 'they do the things they promised to do' is not entailed by the premise 'they you know they'll say one thing to get elected and then once they do get elected they don't have the power or the authority or the willingness to do those things that they promised.' instead, the hypothesis is a negation of the premise, making it an unlikely inference."
4797,that's never i mean i understand that they're talking about the job  not the person in the job that's that's always that's always been strange i thought but some women like to fight it,I believe they are talking about the individual and not the job.,0,0,True,"step 1. the premise expresses the speaker's confusion regarding the topic of a conversation – whether it is about a job or an individual. the speaker mentions that they've always found it strange that some people distinguish between the two. step 2. the hypothesis represents the speaker's new belief or assumption that the topic is about an individual. this interpretation is not contradictory to the premise, as the premise does not definitively state that the conversation is about jobs or that the speaker disagrees with the possibility of the topic being about individuals. step 3. based on the lack of contradiction between the premise and hypothesis, and the possibility of alternative interpretations, the hypothesis is not logically entailed by the premise, but it could still be correct. the speaker's new interpretation does not contradict the old one, and both could be valid based on the given information."
4836,Televisions are expensive these days.,Televisions cost $200 when you purchase them from Ebay.,1,0,False,"step 1. in the premise, it is stated that 'televisions are expensive these days'. this information does not provide any specific details about the cost of a television from any particular source, including ebay. it is a general statement about the current price level of televisions in the market.step 2. the hypothesis, 'televisions cost $200 when you purchase them from ebay', is a specific claim about the cost of televisions from a particular source. however, the premise does not provide any information that can logically lead to this conclusion. the hypothesis contradicts the general statement in the premise that 'televisions are expensive these days', as it suggests that televisions can be purchased for a specific, lower price from ebay.step 3. based on the given information, the hypothesis is not logically entailed by the premise. in fact, the hypothesis goes against the general statement in the premise."
4925,Her arms were bound behind her and I could see her twisted arm bending at a sickening angle.,She was free to move around.,0,0,True,"step 1: in the premise, the woman's arms are bound behind her, limiting her ability to move freely. the description of her twisted arm suggests an injury. the premise does not contain any information contradicting the hypothesis.step 2: the hypothesis 'she was free to move around' contradicts the premise as it states that her arms were bound.step 3: based on the logical analysis, the hypothesis 'she was free to move around' cannot be logically inferred from the premise as it contradicts the information provided in the premise."
4930,"Of course, it will be hard, with those two companies dominating the shelf space of every Foot Locker, to sniff out Brooks, Saucony, Asics, Fila, or New Balance.","It's easy, despite the dominance of the other companies.",0,0,True,"step 1: in the premise, the speaker is expressing a challenge in finding lesser-known brands (brooks, saucony, asics, fila, or new balance) among the dominating companies in foot locker. the use of the word 'hard' implies effort and difficulty. no contradictory facts are mentioned.step 2: the hypothesis states the opposite of the premise - it suggests that finding these brands is 'easy'. there appears to be no logical connection between the premise and hypothesis based on the information provided. common sense and factual consistency do not support this inference. for instance, dominating shelf space makes it harder, not easier, to find less popular brands.step 3: based on the logical reasoning and the absence of contradictory facts, the hypothesis is not entailed by the premise."
4931,everybody has a specialty and so uh it's sort of it's it's sort of a high class potluck i guess you could say and uh it's wonderful it's uh uh i mean,We typically go to a restaurant.,0,0,True,"step 1: in the premise, it is mentioned that 'everybody has a specialty' and it is described as a 'high class potluck.' these statements suggest a social gathering where everyone brings a dish, possibly based on their expertise or specialty. there is no direct mention or implication of a restaurant in the premise.step 2: the hypothesis states 'we typically go to a restaurant.' this statement contradicts the information in the premise as the descriptions of the event are inconsistent. in the premise, it is described as a potluck where everyone brings a dish, while the hypothesis suggests that they typically go to a restaurant instead.step 3: based on the logical analysis, the hypothesis cannot be inferred from the premise as they describe contradictory situations."
4936,We'll have to give the foal a lift.,We can let the foal do as it pleases.,0,0,True,"step 1: the premise indicates a situation where assistance is required for a foal, which is a young horse. the verb 'lift' suggests that the foal is unable to move or reach a certain height on its own. this is a common scenario for newborn foals as they are not able to stand or walk immediately after birth. step 2: the hypothesis suggests that the foal is free to do as it pleases, which is the opposite of needing a 'lift'. the hypothesis cannot be logically inferred from the premise as the premise implies that the foal is unable to move on its own and the hypothesis suggests that it can move freely. step 3: based on the logical analysis, the hypothesis is not entailed by the premise."
4939,"Thompson's real problem isn't that he indulges himself, it's that he's lazy.","Clearly, Thompson's problem is that he never indulges himself.",0,0,True,"step 1: the premise states that thompson's real problem is his laziness, not his indulgence. it implies that he spends too much time doing nothing instead of engaging in activities or pursuits that he enjoys. step 2: the hypothesis suggests the opposite, stating that thompson doesn't indulge himself at all. this contradicts the premise as it presents thompson's behavior in a completely different light. step 3: based on the information from the premise, the hypothesis cannot be logically inferred as it presents a contradictory statement.step 4: it is important to note that the hypothesis may be incorrect based on common sense and the given context, as thompson's problem being identified as laziness implies that he does not take advantage of opportunities for self-gratification or enjoyment, but it does not necessarily mean he never indulges himself.step 5: in conclusion, the hypothesis is not entailed by the premise due to the contradictory information presented, and the premise does not provide sufficient evidence to support the hypothesis."
4940,I disarmed him easily and before his rapier touched the dirt my own had pierced him through his breast and out his back.,"I fumbled, and my weapon dropped into the sand.  I deflected his next blow with my steel buckler, and rolled to retrieve it before he pressed his advantage further.",0,0,True,"step 1: in the premise, it is stated that the speaker disarmed the opponent easily and killed him with a rapier. this implies a swift and successful engagement with the opponent's weapon and a decisive outcome. step 2: the hypothesis suggests an alternative outcome where the speaker fumbled and lost the weapon. however, there's no mention of such an event in the premise, and the events described are inconsistent. the hypothesis contradicts the premise by presenting a different outcome for the weapon. step 3: based on the logical reasoning and the contradiction between the premise and hypothesis, the hypothesis cannot be inferred from the premise."
4949,I brought this.,My sister brought this. ,0,0,True,"step 1: the premise states that 'i brought this' indicates that the speaker is the one who carried an object to its current location. the hypothesis suggests that someone else, specifically 'my sister', brought the same object. step 2: the hypothesis contradicts the premise because it asserts a different subject as the bringer of the object. however, the premise does not exclude the possibility that the speaker and their sister both brought the object at different times or that they may have carried it together at some point. step 3: based on the given information, the hypothesis cannot be logically inferred from the premise as it contradicts it. the premise does not entail the hypothesis."
4953,uh we're primarily in the uh uh systems integrations business,We are no longer in the systems integrations business.,0,0,True,"step 1: in the premise, it is stated that the business is primarily in the systems integrations field. this implies that a significant portion of the company's activities, resources, and expertise revolve around systems integrations. step 2: the hypothesis suggests a complete reversal of the premise, asserting that the business is no longer involved in systems integrations. this is a contradiction to the premise's statement. step 3: based on the given information and logical principles, the hypothesis cannot be logically inferred from the premise as it contradicts it.step 4: it's important to note that the premise mentions 'primarily' in the systems integrations business, which might leave room for other activities. however, the hypothesis as it is stated is a clear contradiction to the premise, so a more nuanced hypothesis might be needed to consider other possible business areas and still be logically consistent with the premise."
4954,Individuals and corporations in Oklahoma are required to pay fee charges to both levels of government : : state and local.,Individuals and corporations in Oklahoma are required to pay taxes or fee charges to both levels of government: state and local.,1,1,True,"step 1: in the premise, it is stated that individuals and corporations in oklahoma are required to pay fee charges to both levels of government: state and local. this implies a legal or regulatory obligation. the term 'fee charges' is often used interchangeably with 'taxes' in the context of mandatory financial contributions to the government. therefore, the premise and hypothesis share a significant similarity.step 2: the hypothesis 'individuals and corporations in oklahoma are required to pay taxes or fee charges to both levels of government: state and local' is a more general statement than the premise. it includes the requirement to pay 'taxes', which is a specific type of fee charge. since the premise already establishes the existence of a legal obligation to pay fee charges to both levels of government, it is reasonable to infer that this obligation could include taxes as well.step 3: based on the logical reasoning and the commonality between 'fee charges' and 'taxes', the hypothesis can be reasonably inferred from the premise."
4969,yeah the times are different yeah,"No, it's about the same. ",0,0,True,"step 1: the premise is a statement expressing that 'the times are different'. this statement is subjective and does not provide specific information about the context or the extent of the difference. the hypothesis, on the other hand, asserts that 'it's about the same'. this statement is a negation of a possible difference, which implies a comparison between the times.step 2: the hypothesis contradicts the premise because if the times are different, they are not the same. a negation of a statement cannot be logically inferred from that statement.step 3: based on the logical negation relationship between the premise and hypothesis, the hypothesis is not entailed by the premise."
4971,"The track continues past the necropolis to an impressive amphitheatre, very probably carved by Nabateans, but influenced by the Romans.",The path will not lead you down to the amphitheater.  ,0,0,True,"step 1: in the premise, it is stated that the track continues past the necropolis to an amphitheater. the amphitheater is described as 'impressive' and 'very probably carved by nabateans, but influenced by the romans'. this suggests a historic and significant structure. no mention is made of any obstacles or barriers preventing access to the amphitheater.step 2: the hypothesis suggests that 'the path will not lead you down to the amphitheater'. this directly contradicts the information provided in the premise, as the premise indicates that the track does indeed lead to the amphitheater.step 3: based on the logical analysis, the hypothesis cannot be logically inferred from the premise as it contradicts the information provided."
4975,"Moreover, the obits also recorded lots of violent and accidental deaths.",Many obituaries are for people who have not died yet.,0,0,True,"step 1: in the premise, it is mentioned that there were 'lots of violent and accidental deaths' recorded in the obituaries. this implies that these deaths have occurred and are being reported. common sense and factual knowledge also support the idea that obituaries are typically published after a person has passed away. step 2: the hypothesis, 'many obituaries are for people who have not died yet,' contradicts the premise and common sense understanding of what an obituary is. an obituary is a news article that reports the death and life of a deceased person. step 3: based on the logical inconsistency between the hypothesis and the premise, as well as the common sense understanding of what an obituary is, the hypothesis is not entailed by the premise."
4982,and see if Kansas if Kansas yeah but then you know it could be what if they're not hitting that night or they're low or anything and see i i feel like the college you know it's kids it's still kids,"If it's college, they are adults.",0,0,True,"step 1. the premise discusses a scenario involving kansas, implying a location, and mentions 'college' which refers to an educational institution. however, it also expresses uncertainty about the age of the individuals involved, suggesting they could still be kids. step 2. the hypothesis states that 'if it's college, they are adults.' this statement contradicts the premise's uncertainty about the age of the individuals. step 3. based on the information and the logical inconsistency between the premise and hypothesis, the hypothesis cannot be inferred from the premise."
5005,The cookie-cutter profiles note that Kennedy was a mediocre student but had a perfect 6-0 conviction record as a prosecutor.,Kennedy was a mediocre student because he did not work hard.,1,0,False,"step 1: in the premise, we have information about kennedy's academic performance and his record as a prosecutor. the fact that he was a mediocre student doesn't necessarily mean he didn't work hard; it could be due to various reasons. the perfect 6-0 conviction record shows his skills in the legal profession.step 2: the hypothesis suggests a possible reason for kennedy's mediocre academic performance - he didn't work hard. while this is a possibility, it is not logically entailed by the premise. the premise only states kennedy's academic performance and his record as a prosecutor, it doesn't provide information about kennedy's work ethic during his student years.step 3: based on the information provided, the hypothesis cannot be logically inferred from the premise. the premise does not provide enough evidence to support the hypothesis."
5069,"It focuses on desktop, client/server, and enterprisewide computing.",It lacks focus on desktop and enterprise computing sector.,0,0,True,"step 1: in the premise, it is mentioned that the computing focus includes desktop, client/server, and enterprisewide computing. this implies a broad scope of coverage. step 2: the hypothesis suggests a lack of focus on desktop and enterprise computing sectors. however, the absence of a focus is not directly observable or mentioned in the premise. instead, the premise states that these sectors are part of the focus. step 3: based on the given information, the hypothesis that 'it lacks focus on desktop and enterprise computing sector' cannot be logically inferred from the premise. the premise's information is consistent with having a focus on these sectors, and the absence of focus is not suggested or indicated."
5076,A little boy in green is kicking a soccer ball and 6 boys in referee shirts are following him.,The girls are putting on makeup in the room.,0,0,True,"step 1: in the premise, a little boy in green is identified, and he is kicking a soccer ball. six boys in referee shirts are following him. there is no mention of girls or any indication that they are present or engaging in any activity.step 2: the hypothesis, 'the girls are putting on makeup in the room', is not logically inferable from the premise, as there is no mention or implication of girls or makeup in the scenario described.step 3: based on the given information, the hypothesis cannot be inferred from the premise."
5090,"In the interior (fourth chapel on left aisle), look for Jacopo della Quercia's marble altar (1422).",Jacopo della Quercia's marble altar was completed in the winter of AD1422.,1,0,False,"step 1. in the premise, jacopo della quercia's marble altar is identified, and the year of completion is mentioned as 1422. no specific season or month is mentioned in the premise. step 2. the hypothesis suggests that the completion of the marble altar took place during the winter season of ad1422. while the premise does not contradict this claim, it does not explicitly state or infer that the completion happened during winter. step 3. the hypothesis cannot be logically inferred from the premise as the premise does not provide enough information to entail the winter completion of the altar. it is possible that the altar was completed during another season in ad1422, and the premise does not exclude this possibility. step 4. based on the logical analysis and the lack of sufficient information in the premise to infer the hypothesis, the hypothesis is not entailed by the premise."
5095,Most of the development missiles were built in specialty shops rather than in a manufacturing environment.,The missiles were built out in the wild.,0,0,True,"step 1: in the premise, 'most of the development missiles were built in specialty shops rather than in a manufacturing environment', the key information is that the missiles were built in specialty shops, which are typically small workshops or facilities where custom or complex items are produced. this setting is distinct from a manufacturing environment, which implies a large-scale production process. step 2: the hypothesis 'the missiles were built out in the wild' contradicts the premise since the premise states that the missiles were built in specialty shops, not out in the wild. building missiles in the wild is not a typical or reasonable way to produce them. step 3: based on the logical analysis, the hypothesis 'the missiles were built out in the wild' cannot be inferred from the premise as it contradicts the information provided in the premise."
5105,"Recognizing that more action was needed to improve the CSR system, LSC provided additional written guidance to the field, including a substantial revision to its CSR Handbook (reissued in November 1998), and conducted training sessions on that guidance.",They did everything they could to present their product the best. ,1,1,True,"step 1: in the premise, lsc acknowledges that they identified a need for improvement in their csr system and took actions to address it. they provided written guidance and conducted training sessions. these actions can be seen as efforts to present their product (csr system) in the best possible way. step 2: the hypothesis can be inferred from the premise as the actions taken by lsc to improve their csr system can be considered as presenting their product the best, in the sense of making it as effective and efficient as possible. step 3: based on the logical connection between the premise and hypothesis, the hypothesis can be inferred from the premise."
5106,"She said that the reductions reflect a decline in the number of persons in the state who are living in poverty, according to the U.S.",Someone who is living in poverty is often wealthy to the point that they own multiple properties.,0,0,True,"step 1: in the premise, it is stated that the reductions reflect a decline in the number of persons living in poverty. this implies that the number of impoverished individuals is decreasing. common sense and factual knowledge tell us that a person living in poverty typically has limited financial resources and struggles to make ends meet. step 2: the hypothesis contradicts the premise and common sense understanding of poverty as it states that someone living in poverty is wealthy enough to own multiple properties. owning multiple properties requires significant financial resources, which is inconsistent with the definition and experience of poverty. step 3: based on the logical contradiction between the hypothesis and the premise, the hypothesis cannot be logically inferred from the premise."
5124,The dark skinned man growled low and deep in his throat.,The dark-skinned man smiled pleasantly.,0,0,True,"step 1: the premise describes an action performed by a dark-skinned man, specifically growling. this action is often associated with aggression or anger. however, it is important to note that the premise does not provide any context or additional information about the man's intentions or the situation. step 2: the hypothesis describes an alternative action, smiling pleasantly. this action is often associated with happiness or friendliness. the hypothesis contradicts the premise, as these two actions cannot logically occur at the same time. step 3: based on the given information, the hypothesis cannot be inferred from the premise as they represent contradictory actions."
5147,in public places,In public and private.,1,1,True,"step 1: the premise 'in public places' refers to situations or environments where people gather and interact outside their private homes or properties. it does not specify any limitations on the applicability of the statement.step 2: the hypothesis 'in public and private' expands the scope of the premise by including 'private' spaces or environments in addition to 'public' ones. this expansion is a logical extension because there is no contradiction or limitation in the premise that prevents it from applying to private spaces as well.step 3: based on the logical reasoning that the hypothesis is a logical extension of the premise, and the lack of contradictory information, the hypothesis can be inferred from the premise."
5151,so so we've got to pay a fire tax and we got to pay you know two taxes sounds like you got a a little one there,You have a lot more taxes than we have to pay. ,0,0,True,"step 1: in the premise, it is mentioned that there are two taxes that the speaker has to pay, implying that they have some taxes. in the hypothesis, it is stated that 'you' (presumably referring to someone else) have 'a lot more taxes than we have to pay'. from this, we can infer that the speaker is comparing their tax burden to someone else's.step 2: the hypothesis is not logically entailed by the premise, as the premise does not provide sufficient information to determine that the other person has 'a lot more taxes' than the speaker.step 3: based on the information provided, the hypothesis cannot be reasonably inferred from the premise as it goes beyond the given facts."
5177,"Candidates for citizenship must 1) be 18 or older; 2) have resided in the United States continuously for five years--or three years if married to a U.S. citizen--(short absences are OK); 3) demonstrate the ability to speak English, and a basic knowledge of American history and government (click here to see if you pass the test); and 4) be of good moral character.",Candidates for U.S. citizenship can be younger than 18.,0,0,True,"step 1: in the premise, there are specific requirements for u.s. citizenship, including being 18 or older. this condition is explicitly stated, making it a crucial piece of information. step 2: the hypothesis suggests that candidates for u.s. citizenship can be younger than 18. however, this goes against the requirements stated in the premise. step 3: based on the given information, the hypothesis is not entailed by the premise since it contradicts the stated condition for u.s. citizenship."
5182,"Charles Berkeley, 2nd Viscount Fitzhardinge, was Charles Berkeley, 1st Earl of Falmouth, his nephew.","Charles Berkeley, 2nd Viscount Fitzhardinge, was his brother and Charles Berkeley, 1st Earl of Falmouth, his nephew.",1,0,False,"step 1: both the premise and hypothesis involve charles berkeley, specifically charles berkeley, 2nd viscount fitzhardinge and charles berkeley, 1st earl of falmouth. the relationship described in the premise is that of a nephew and uncle. in the hypothesis, the relationship is stated as both a brother and a nephew.step 2: for the hypothesis to be logically inferred from the premise, the relationship described in the hypothesis must be related to or consistent with the relationship described in the premise. however, the relationship of being a brother and a nephew is not logically consistent with being an uncle and a nephew. they are mutually exclusive. therefore, the hypothesis cannot be logically inferred from the premise.step 3: based on the logical analysis, the hypothesis is not entailed by the premise."
5200,but they showed reruns of Dallas and it was great because i could turn it on and all of the people were very familiar to me and i'd seen all of the shows so i knew what was going on,It's been about 15 years since I watched Dallas when it was first on TV.,1,0,False,"step 1: in the premise, the speaker mentions that they enjoyed watching reruns of dallas because they were familiar with the characters and had seen all the shows. this implies that the speaker had previously watched dallas when it was originally on tv. step 2: the hypothesis states that it has been about 15 years since the speaker last watched dallas. this information, if true, would be consistent with the premise as it suggests that the speaker's initial viewing of dallas occurred more than 15 years before their rewatching of the reruns. step 3: although the hypothesis does not directly follow from the premise, it is a reasonable assumption based on the context provided in the premise. the speaker's statement about being familiar with the characters and having seen all the shows implies that the initial viewing of dallas occurred a significant amount of time ago. the hypothesis quantifies this time frame, but it is consistent with the information given in the premise.step 4: a strict logical entailment may not be present, but the hypothesis is compatible with the premise and does not contradict it. given the context of the premise and the plausibility of the hypothesis, it can be considered a reasonable inference.step 5: based on the logical reasoning and common sense, the hypothesis is likely to be true given the premise, even though it is not logically entailed."
5204,right just get you away from the everyday things that are going on we when the children were smaller we used to go to uh Delaware along the ocean ocean most every year and that was fun we stayed mostly in state parks and uh we really enjoyed that,We didn't enjoy staying in the state parks.,0,0,True,"step 1: in the premise, the speaker is describing a family tradition of going to delaware and staying in state parks every year. the tone of the description is positive, with words like 'fun' and 'enjoyed'. there is no contradictory information provided in the premise. step 2: the hypothesis, 'we didn't enjoy staying in the state parks', contradicts the information provided in the premise. the hypothesis suggests that the speaker and their family disliked staying in state parks, which is in direct opposition to the positive description in the premise. step 3: based on the information provided, the hypothesis cannot be logically inferred from the premise. the premise describes a positive experience, and the hypothesis suggests a negative one, making them inconsistent."
5210, The carpet lifted uncertainly.,"The carpet lifted uncertainly, but this was normal.",1,0,False,"step 1: the premise describes the carpet lifting uncertainly, implying some degree of instability or uncertainty. this description does not provide any specific information about the cause of the lifting or the usual state of the carpet. step 2: the hypothesis adds that the carpet lifting uncertainly is 'normal'. while uncertainty in the lifting of the carpet is not a contradiction to the hypothesis, it does not logically follow from the premise. common sense suggests that a carpet lifting uncertainly does not necessarily mean that it is normal. step 3: based on the logical analysis, the hypothesis is not entailed by the premise, as the hypothesis adds an additional assumption that the uncertain lifting is normal, which is not given in the premise."
5211,"Since the rule does not impose a federal intergovernmental or private sector mandate, as defined in the Unfunded Mandates Reform Act of 1995, sections 202, 204 and 205 of the act are inapplicable.",All of the sections are applicable indefinitely.,0,0,True,"step 1: in the premise, it is stated that sections 202, 204 and 205 of the unfunded mandates reform act of 1995 are inapplicable due to the rule not imposing a federal intergovernmental or private sector mandate as defined in the act. this implies that the rule does not require any actions or expenditures from the federal government or the private sector that would result in a mandate.step 2: the hypothesis states that all sections are applicable indefinitely. however, this contradicts the information provided in the premise, as the premise clearly indicates that at least some sections are not applicable.step 3: based on the logical analysis, the hypothesis is not entailed by the premise, as the hypothesis asserts a fact that contradicts the information provided in the premise."
5221,"Look out for the gilded Golden Temple of Vishwanath, the holiest temple of Varanasi, forbidden to non-Hindus.",The gilded Golden Temple of Vishwanath is open to all.,0,0,True,"step 1: in the premise, the gilded golden temple of vishwanath is described as a holy temple in varanasi, which is forbidden to non-hindus. this implies that there are certain access restrictions in place. common sense and factual knowledge tell us that 'forbidden to non-hindus' means that non-hindus are not allowed to enter the temple.step 2: the hypothesis contradicts the premise. if the temple is open to all, then the 'forbidden to non-hindus' condition no longer applies.step 3: based on the logical negation of the premise leading to the hypothesis, it is clear that the hypothesis cannot be logically inferred from the premise."
5224,"And, to be clear about it, the massive censorship necessary to avoid it is certainly not worth the cost in freedom.",The large amount of censorship would lead to an increase in freedom.,0,0,True,"step 1: in the premise, the speaker argues against censorship, stating that the cost of censorship in terms of freedom outweighs the benefits. this implies a negative relationship between censorship and freedom. step 2: the hypothesis suggests an opposite relationship, stating that censorship would lead to an increase in freedom. this relationship contradicts the premise. step 3: based on the logical relationship between censorship and freedom as described in the premise, it can be concluded that the hypothesis is not entailed by the premise."
5227,yeah well they do well it it we found out that didn't work because we even even bought the expensive stuff and they looked at it like you've got to be kidding like you know what are you a fool paying that much money for this,We found out only the really expensive stuff work because they looked at it and told us that it worked.,0,0,True,"step 1: in the premise, it is mentioned that they found out 'it didn't work' when they bought 'expensive stuff'. the speaker and others expressed their disbelief and considered them fools for spending a lot of money. however, no specific information is given about 'it' or the 'expensive stuff'. thus, the context is unclear.step 2: the hypothesis suggests a different scenario where they only found out 'it worked' when they bought the 'expensive stuff' and were told it worked by someone. this hypothesis contradicts the premise because it implies a different outcome – that the 'expensive stuff' was effective instead of ineffective.step 3: based on the given information, the hypothesis cannot be logically inferred from the premise since it contradicts it.step 4: the hypothesis seems to be an alternative explanation, but it doesn't follow logically from the premise and there isn't enough context or information to support it in this case."
5267,The merchants who established a foothold in Kobe included large numbers of Persians and Indian traders.,Kobe is famous for its Kebabs.,1,1,True,"step 1: in the premise, it is stated that there were large numbers of persian and indian traders in kobe. persians and indians are known for their culinary traditions, including the preparation of kebabs. the presence of these traders could have introduced the dish to kobe. step 2: the hypothesis 'kobe is famous for its kebabs' can be logically inferred from the premise because the presence of persian and indian traders in kobe can reasonably explain how the dish became popular in that region. step 3: based on the logical reasoning and factual information, the hypothesis is entailed by the premise."
5283,"Actually, more than a year ago (June 18, 1996) the Wall Street Journal 's Michael Frisby wrote a long story on Peter Knight that disclosed Knight's connection to Molten, Molten's donations to the Democrats, and the company's success in obtaining contracts from the Clinton administration.",The company was unsuccessful in obtaining contracts from the Clinton administration.,0,0,True,"step 1: in the premise, it is stated that the wall street journal published a story about peter knight and molten, revealing knight's connection to the company and its donations to the democrats. the story also mentions that molten was successful in obtaining contracts from the clinton administration.step 2: contradictorily, the hypothesis suggests that molten was unsuccessful in obtaining contracts from the clinton administration. the hypothesis directly contradicts the information presented in the premise.step 3: based on the given information, the hypothesis cannot be logically inferred from the premise as they are in contradiction."
5335,unless you buy it from i say somebody you know you know like from a family member or a like that one,You can buy it from anyone; it doesn't change anything.,0,0,True,"step 1: in the premise, the speaker mentions that one should buy something only from someone they know, such as a family member. this implies a restriction on where the buying transaction can occur. step 2: the hypothesis suggests that buying from anyone does not change anything. while this is not necessarily contradictory to the premise, it does not follow logically from it. the premise places a condition on where one should buy, and the hypothesis does not address or account for this condition. step 3: based on the given information, the hypothesis cannot be inferred from the premise as it does not logically follow."
5351,"News berates computer users for picking obvious, easily cracked passwords and chastises system administrators for ignoring basic security precautions.",News outlets do not blame users or system administrators for security breaches. ,0,0,True,"step 1: in the premise, 'news' is criticizing computer users and system administrators for their role in weak security. this implies that these individuals are responsible for the security issues, which is the opposite of 'not blaming' them. step 2: the hypothesis directly contradicts the information provided in the premise. therefore, it cannot be logically inferred from the premise. step 3: the hypothesis is not entailed by the premise, as there is a clear contradiction between the two statements."
5381,"'Well, things'll go a lot smoother if you're not leaning over my shoulder.",We laid entwined on the ground.,0,0,True,"step 1: the premise indicates a request for personal space from the speaker to the listener. leaning over someone's shoulder is seen as an invasion of their personal space. this situation does not involve any physical contact or close proximity to the ground.step 2: the hypothesis describes a scenario where individuals are 'laid entwined on the ground.' this implies a close physical contact, likely involving lying in a position where bodies are intertwined. the individuals in this situation are in close proximity to each other and the ground.step 3: the hypothesis contradicts the premise because the scenario described in the hypothesis does not align with the sense of personal space and independence expressed in the premise. the individuals in the hypothesis are described as being in close contact, which is not consistent with the premise's statement about not leaning over someone's shoulder.step 4: based on the logical contradiction between the premise and hypothesis, we can conclude that the hypothesis is not entailed by the premise."
5449,Gentilello agreed that we should all keep publishing in our various disciplines.,Gentilello was responsible for overseeing all the publishing.,1,0,False,"step 1: in the premise, gentilello is mentioned as agreeing that publishing should continue in various disciplines. this statement does not provide any information about gentilello's role in the actual publishing process. common sense and logical principles do not dictate that gentilello's agreement implies responsibility for overseeing all the publishing.step 2: the hypothesis, 'gentilello was responsible for overseeing all the publishing' contradicts the premise. the premise describes gentilello as agreeing to the publishing, while the hypothesis asserts that he is directly responsible for managing it.step 3: based on the logical analysis, the hypothesis cannot be inferred from the premise as it contradicts the given information."
5536,"As Felicia, the coltish Elaine Cassidy manages to look both luminous and unformed, and Bob Hoskins gives Hiditch's bland homilies so much subtext he made me think of the Paris Opera House in the Phantom of the Opera : basement under basement under basement down to the dungeons.",Felicia's Journey really didn't impress me because Elaine Cassidy and Bob Hoskins' acting were quite bland.,0,0,True,"step 1: in the premise, the descriptions of elaine cassidy's performance as 'coltish' and 'luminous' and bob hoskins' performance as giving 'subtext' and reminiscent of the paris opera house are subjective evaluations of their acting. they indicate that the reviewer found their performances to be nuanced and impactful in some way. the mention of 'basement under basement under basement' in relation to bob hoskins' performance suggests a deeper meaning or hidden complexity.step 2: the hypothesis states that felicia's journey did not impress the speaker due to finding elaine cassidy and bob hoskins' acting to be bland. this is a contradiction to the premise, as the premise implies that the reviewer found their acting to be anything but bland. the hypothesis cannot be logically inferred from the premise.step 3: based on the given information, the hypothesis is not entailed by the premise."
5537,The peninsula's unity was enhanced by the expanding network of railways and roads.,The people of the peninsula felt closer as a result of the improved ability to travel.,1,1,True,"step 1: in the premise, the expanding network of railways and roads is stated as a factor that enhances the unity of the peninsula. this implies that the infrastructure development facilitates easier and more efficient movement and communication between different parts of the peninsula.step 2: the hypothesis 'the people of the peninsula felt closer' suggests a psychological or emotional connection between the residents. this feeling of closeness can be reasonably inferred from the premise since better travel infrastructure enables easier interactions and stronger community bonds.step 3: based on the logical reasoning, the hypothesis can be inferred from the premise as it is a plausible outcome of the enhanced unity due to the expanding transportation network."
5539,"Sports writers debated whether it's a triumph for 1) Knicks guard Allan Houston, a previous underachiever who scored 32 points in the decisive game; 2) Coach Jeff Van Gundy, who had nearly been fired earlier in the season; or 3) New York, whose prestige was already bolstered by cleaner streets and lower crime.","Following the defeat, sports writers agreed that Allan Houston and Coach Jeff Van Gundy are equally to blame.",0,0,True,"step 1: in the premise, sports writers are debating whether it's a triumph for allan houston, coach jeff van gundy, or new york. the debate indicates that there are multiple potential candidates for the triumph. step 2: the hypothesis suggests a different outcome, stating that both allan houston and coach jeff van gundy are equally to blame. this is a contradiction to the premise since the debate in the premise does not involve the notion that they are equally to blame. step 3: based on the logical analysis, the hypothesis cannot be inferred from the premise as it contradicts the information provided in the premise."

5645,"This is the second on-screen collaboration among Leonardo DiCaprio, Kate Winslet and Kathy Bates, who previously co-starred in ""Titanic"".","This is the second on-screen collaboration among Leonardo DiCaprio, William Joyce and Kathy Bates, who previously co-starred in ""Titanic"".",0,0,True,"step 1: the premise states that leonardo dicaprio, kate winslet, and kathy bates have worked together on-screen for the second time, having previously appeared in 'titanic'. the names of the actors are specified. step 2: the hypothesis suggests a different set of actors (leonardo dicaprio, william joyce, and kathy bates) for the second collaboration. although they have all acted in 'titanic' before, their pairings in the premise and hypothesis differ. step 3: based on the given information, the hypothesis cannot be logically inferred from the premise as they describe different collaborations."
5650,ISO 9000 certification recognizes standardized quality processes established by organizations to produce consistently high-quality products or services.,For example it is recommended to use certain types of wood.,1,0,False,"step 1: iso 9000 certification is a standard for recognizing organizations that have established and maintain certain quality processes. these processes aim to ensure the production of consistently high-quality products or services. the premise does not provide any specific information about the types of products or materials that are being referred to, only that iso 9000 certification relates to standardized processes for producing high-quality outputs.step 2: the hypothesis, stating 'it is recommended to use certain types of wood', does not logically follow from the premise. the premise is about standardized processes for producing high-quality outputs, it does not mention anything about specific materials or products, nor does it imply a recommendation.step 3: based on the logical analysis, the hypothesis is not entailed by the premise."
5651,"For their part, family-planning organizations and the Clinton administration seem equally adamant.",Family-planning organizations and Pence don't get along.,1,0,False,"step 1: in the premise, it is mentioned that family-planning organizations and the clinton administration are adamant about something. however, the text does not provide information about what they are adamant about or who they don't get along with. pence is introduced in the hypothesis, but there is no indication of a relationship between him and family-planning organizations in the premise. step 2: the hypothesis suggests a conflict or disagreement between family-planning organizations and pence. however, the premise does not provide any evidence or logical connection to support this hypothesis. step 3: based on the information provided, the hypothesis cannot be logically inferred from the premise."
5660,and and and the restriction is it sort of,Is the newest restriction sort of,1,0,False,"step 1. the premise does not provide clear-cut information for logical inference. the term 'and and and' is ambiguous and could represent multiple 'and' connections between different concepts. 'the restriction is it sort of' is unclear in relation to the premise.step 2. the hypothesis does not logically follow from the premise as the premise does not contain sufficient information for the conclusion 'is the newest restriction sort of' to be reasonably inferred.step 3. based on the lack of clear logical connection and the ambiguous nature of the given information, the hypothesis cannot be logically inferred from the premise."
5667,i know excuse me just a minute i think Katy get off the phone,Katy is being annoying on the phone and I hate her.,1,0,False,"step 1: in the premise, the speaker requests katy to get off the phone, which implies they are on the phone with her and finding the conversation unpleasant. this situation does not necessarily mean that the speaker hates katy, but it suggests a negative interaction.step 2: the hypothesis 'katy is being annoying on the phone and i hate her' goes beyond the information in the premise by adding the emotional component of 'hate'. however, a negative phone interaction could reasonably lead to hating someone. annoying behavior on the phone can be perceived as disruptive, frustrating, or even provocative, which could escalate emotions.step 3: based on the information identified in steps 1 and 2, the hypothesis is a possible inference from the premise, but it is not an immediate logical entailment. the premise only establishes a negative interaction on the phone, while the hypothesis adds the strong emotional component of hating someone. however, the hypothesis is consistent with the premise as the negative interaction could reasonably lead to hating someone.therefore, the hypothesis is a plausible inference from the premise, but it does not follow logically.label: 0"
5732,These OMB and GAO issuances establish the criteria and rules for assessing and reporting annually on the status of agency systems and controls.,The GAO set forth criteria for the dismemberment and complete take over of agency systems and controls.,0,0,True,"step 1: in the premise, the omb (office of management and budget) and gao (government accountability office) are identified as establishing criteria and rules for assessing and reporting on the status of agency systems and controls on an annual basis. this implies a process of evaluating the effectiveness and efficiency of these systems and controls.step 2: the hypothesis proposes that the gao set forth criteria for the dismemberment and complete take over of agency systems and controls. this is a significant departure from the premise as it suggests a drastic and potentially disruptive action, rather than a simple evaluation or reporting process.step 3: given the difference between the premise and hypothesis, it is not logically entailed that the gao set forth criteria for the dismemberment and complete take over of agency systems and controls based on the information provided in the premise. the premise describes a process of assessment and reporting, while the hypothesis suggests a complete restructuring or takeover that goes beyond the scope of the premise. therefore, the hypothesis is not entailed by the premise."
5735,well they said that women like the the you know executive women or women that work whatever they spend uh five hundred dollars on clothes a year so but but for me,Women that do not work spend less money on clothes.,1,0,False,"step 1: in the premise, it is stated that executive women or women who work spend $500 on clothes per year. this implies that there is a correlation between a woman's employment status and her spending on clothes. step 2: the hypothesis suggests that women who do not work spend less money on clothes compared to women who do work. this is a contrasting statement to the premise, which implies a higher spending for women who work. step 3: this contrasting statement cannot be logically inferred from the premise, as the premise only provides information about women who work and their spending habits, not women who do not work. therefore, no entailment exists between the premise and hypothesis."
5737,The Committee intends that LSC consult with appropriate stakeholders in developing this proposal.,The Committee discourages LSC to consult with any stakeholders.,0,0,True,"step 1: the premise indicates an intention of the committee that lsc consults with 'appropriate stakeholders' in the development of a proposal. this implies that the involvement of stakeholders is expected and necessary. common sense and logical understanding of the term 'consult' also suggest a communication and exchange of information or ideas. step 2: the hypothesis, however, suggests the opposite of the premise, 'discourages lsc to consult with any stakeholders.' these statements contradict each other, as the premise indicates the need for consultation while the hypothesis suggests its prohibition. step 3: based on the logical contradiction between the premise and hypothesis, the hypothesis cannot be inferred from the premise."
5742,An electronic signature is a method of signing an electronic message that (1) identifies and authenticates a particular person as the source of the electronic message and (2) indicates such person's approval of the information contained in the electronic message.,An electronic signature isn't a method of signing an electronic message that (1) identifies and authenticates a particular person as the source of the electronic message,0,0,True,"step 1: in the premise, an electronic signature is described as a method that identifies and authenticates a person as the source of an electronic message and indicates their approval. this implies that an electronic signature serves to confirm the identity of the sender and their intent to send the message.step 2: the hypothesis denies the premise by stating that an electronic signature isn't a method of identifying and authenticating a particular person as the source of an electronic message.step 3: a direct contradiction exists between the premise and the hypothesis. the hypothesis cannot be logically inferred from the premise, as it negates the core concept stated in the premise.step 4: based on the logical analysis, the hypothesis is not entailed by the premise."
5775,"If, however, the Gore campaign is worried, they're not saying so publicly.",Gore campaign is publicly worried.,0,0,True,"step 1: in the premise, it is stated that the gore campaign is not expressing their worries publicly. this implies that they might be worried in private but choosing not to share this information with the public.step 2: the hypothesis suggests that the gore campaign is publicly worried, which is directly contradictory to the information in the premise. there is no logical connection between the premise and the hypothesis.step 3: based on the provided information, the hypothesis is not entailed by the premise. in fact, the hypothesis contradicts the premise."
5789,"Staring at a computer screen all day, pretending to be busy--it was","Glued to the computer screen all day, working his fingers to the bone.",0,0,True,"step 1. the premise describes a situation where someone is staring at a computer screen all day, implying that they are engaged in some sort of sedentary activity. it does not provide any explicit information about the reason for their behavior or their level of productivity. step 2. the hypothesis suggests that the person is 'working his fingers to the bone' while being 'glued to the computer screen.' this implies a strong commitment to their work and a high level of productivity, in contrast to the neutral description in the premise. step 3. while the hypothesis cannot be directly inferred from the premise, as it introduces new information about the person's motivation and work ethic, it is not contradictory to the premise. the hypothesis is a reasonable assumption based on the context and common sense understanding of the situation. step 4. the premise does not rule out the possibility of high productivity, but it also does not provide any evidence to support it. the hypothesis offers a more detailed interpretation of the situation, assuming that the person is working hard.in summary, the hypothesis is not logically entailed by the premise, but it is a reasonable assumption based on common sense and the available context."
5797,Italian food  yeah pizzas and spaghettis and lasagnas and that kind of stuff,Italian is my favorite kind of food.,1,0,False,"step 1: the premise describes a type of food, specifically italian food, and mentions some popular dishes like pizzas, spaghettis, and lasagnas. it does not provide any information about personal preferences. step 2: the hypothesis expresses a personal preference for italian food. while the premise does not explicitly state this preference, it does not contradict it either. step 3: although the premise does not logically entail the hypothesis because it does not provide sufficient information about personal preferences, it does not contradict it either. thus, the hypothesis is not logically entailed by the premise but is consistent with it.step 4: inferring personal preferences from premises is generally beyond the scope of logical reasoning as it relies on subjective experiences and individual contexts.therefore, based on the given information, the hypothesis is not logically entailed by the premise, but it can be consistent with it."
5817,It is the third installment in the Stuart Little trilogy.,"It is the third installment in the Stuart Little trilogy, but unlike its two predecessors, it is entirely animated.",1,0,False,"step 1: the premise establishes that the given text is the third installment in the stuart little trilogy. no specific details about the format or presentation of the third installment are mentioned. step 2: the hypothesis introduces a new piece of information, stating that the third installment is animated. however, the hypothesis does not contradict the premise as both sentences agree on the third installment being part of the stuart little trilogy. step 3: though the hypothesis adds information not present in the premise, it does not contradict or alter the logical relationship between the sentences. the hypothesis can represent an alternate version or adaptation of the third installment in the stuart little trilogy, which is still a valid possibility given the lack of explicit information about the presentation in the premise. step 4: in conclusion, the hypothesis 'it is the third installment in the stuart little trilogy, but unlike its two predecessors, it is entirely animated' can be seen as a more specific or alternative rendering of the information provided in the premise. though not logically entailed, it is a reasonable assumption given the lack of explicit information about the format of the third installment in the premise."
5842,The divorce cost Hudson its biggest client and inaugurated Burger King's campaign to persuade customers to continue eating its meat.,Burger King had begun to have trouble with customers questioning what their burgers were actually made of.,1,1,True,"step 1: in the premise, it is mentioned that hudson lost its biggest client due to the divorce. no specific reason is given for this loss, but it is reasonable to infer that this could be due to various factors, one of which could be public perception or customer dissatisfaction. burger king, on the other hand, is noted to have started a campaign to persuade customers to continue eating its meat, suggesting there might be some concerns or doubts about the meat's authenticity.step 2: the hypothesis suggests that customers were questioning the authenticity of burger king's burgers. this issue aligns with the premise as it mentions a potential factor for hudson's client loss and burger king's response to it. the hypothesis can be seen as a reasonable consequence or extension of the information given in the premise.step 3: based on the logical connection between the premise and hypothesis, and the absence of contradictory information, the hypothesis can be inferred from the premise."
5844,"Nearly a third of North Carolina remains shut down by flooding, and the state now faces water pollution due to animal carcasses and sewage.",North Carolina is in a state of drought after not receiving any rain for a long time.,0,0,True,"step 1: in the premise, it is mentioned that nearly a third of north carolina is shut down due to flooding and the state is facing water pollution due to animal carcasses and sewage. this indicates that north carolina is experiencing heavy rainfall and flooding. common sense and facts tell us that flooding is the result of water accumulation, which is the opposite of a drought. there are no statements or implications in the premise that suggest a lack of rain or drought.step 2: the hypothesis, 'north carolina is in a state of drought after not receiving any rain for a long time', contradicts the premise as it states that north carolina is experiencing a lack of rain, which is not indicated in the premise. moreover, the hypothesis is logically inconsistent with the flooding and water pollution described in the premise.step 3: based on the logical reasoning, common sense, and the factual inconsistency with the premise, the hypothesis 'north carolina is in a state of drought after not receiving any rain for a long time' cannot be inferred from the premise."
5848,How long could it take?,How fast could it take?,0,0,True,"step 1: in the premise, 'how long could it take?' is asking for the time duration required to accomplish a task. in the hypothesis, 'how fast could it take?' is asking for the speed at which a task can be accomplished.step 2: the premise and hypothesis ask about different aspects of a task – duration (premise) and speed (hypothesis. they do not have a direct logical relationship, as one does not entail the other.step 3: based on the logical analysis, the hypothesis is not entailed by the premise."
5857,yeah but the snow also helps you know and it it we had like one foot deep snow in this in this open field and so it was a little hard to run but when you got hit and you fell you didn't really feel it,It's much easier to run in deep snow than on smooth grass.,0,0,True,"step 1. the premise describes a situation where running in deep snow is challenging due to increased resistance, but also provides an unexpected benefit of less pain upon falling. the resistance when running in deep snow can be attributed to the snow acting as a cushion, reducing the impact of falls. step 2. the hypothesis suggests the contrary, stating that it's easier to run in deep snow than on smooth grass. this contradicts the information provided in the premise, as the premise establishes that running in deep snow is harder than on smooth grass. step 3. based on the information given in the premise, the hypothesis is not logically entailed and in fact contradicts it."
5876,Individual employers were aware as claims were pursued against them after their former H-2A workers had left the United States.,"The claims against employers of former H-2A workers did not succeed, but caused significant trouble for the employers.",1,0,False,"step 1: in the premise, it is stated that employers were aware of claims being pursued against them after their h-2a workers had left the united states. this implies that there were legal disputes or claims against these employers. however, the premise does not provide any information about the outcomes of these claims. step 2: the hypothesis suggests that the claims did not succeed but caused significant trouble for the employers. this implies that the claims were unsuccessful in terms of the workers receiving compensation or justice, but they still caused some sort of negative impact on the employers. step 3: based on the given information, it is not possible to logically infer the hypothesis from the premise. while it is known that employers were aware of the claims, there is no information provided about the outcomes of these claims. thus, it cannot be determined if the claims caused significant trouble for the employers without additional context."
5913,"Specifically, the survey showed that the proportion of companies managing and using frequent flyer miles received by their travelers fell from 9 percent in 1994 to 4 percent in 1996.",More companies were using the frequent flyer miles their travelers earned.,0,0,True,"step 1. in the premise, we have a decrease in the proportion of companies managing and using frequent flyer miles from 9% to 4% between 1994 and 1996. this suggests that there might be fewer companies engaging in this practice. step 2. contradictorily, the hypothesis suggests an increase in the number of companies using frequent flyer miles. however, the premise does not provide any information about the total number of miles being used, only the proportion of companies managing and using them. step 3. based on the information given, it is not possible to logically infer the hypothesis from the premise as the premise does not rule out the possibility of more miles being used by fewer companies. thus, the hypothesis is not entailed by the premise."
5926,"In Crace's version, a rebellious, bratty Jesus dies of starvation at the end of his 40-day sojourn in the wilderness.","In Crace's version, Jesus goes on a feast instead of having a 40-day sojourn in the wilderness.",0,0,True,"step 1: in the premise, crace's version of the jesus story is described as having a rebellious, bratty jesus who dies of starvation after a 40-day sojourn in the wilderness. this implies that jesus did not have access to food during this period. step 2: the hypothesis states that in crace's version, jesus goes on a feast instead of having a 40-day sojourn in the wilderness. this contradicts the premise as it suggests that jesus had access to an abundance of food, which is not consistent with the information given in the premise. step 3: based on the information provided in the premise and the logical contradiction between the premise and hypothesis, the hypothesis is not entailed by the premise."
5927,A cowboy struggling to maintain control on a horse at a rodeo.,cheese is made from water,0,0,True,"step 1. in the premise, a scenario is described where a cowboy is having difficulty controlling a horse at a rodeo. this information does not provide any direct connection or relevance to the hypothesis. there are no logical connections, commonsense understandings, or factual inconsistencies that can be drawn from the given premise and hypothesis.step 2. the hypothesis, 'cheese is made from water', is not logically related to the premise, which describes a cowboy struggling to control a horse at a rodeo. there is no information in the premise that implies or suggests the production or consumption of cheese.step 3. based on the lack of logical connection between the premise and hypothesis, and the absence of any relevant information in the premise that would allow the hypothesis to be inferred, the hypothesis is not entailed by the premise.step 4. it's important to note that the hypothesis is factually incorrect as cheese is not made from water alone."
5928,That's a queer name for a monster.,That is a very absurd and strange name for a supposed monster.,1,1,True,"step 1: in the premise, the speaker expresses their opinion that the name given to a monster is 'queer'. queer in this context means unusual or strange. step 2: the hypothesis also expresses an opinion that the name given to a supposed monster is 'absurd' and 'strange'. absurd means extremely irrational or meaningless, and strange means unusual or unexpected. while there might be some nuanced differences in the meanings of the words used, both the premise and hypothesis convey similar ideas - that the name for the monster is unusual or strange. step 3: based on the similarities in the meanings of the words used and the fact that both the premise and hypothesis are expressing opinions, the hypothesis can be inferred from the premise.step 4: it is important to note that the process of logical inference does not require that the hypothesis be an exact copy of the premise, but rather that the meaning conveyed in the hypothesis can be logically derived from the premise."
5929,THE ISLANDS AND THEIR PEOPLE,The deserted islands.,0,0,True,"step 1: in the premise, 'the islands and their people', the term 'islands' is identified as the subject. no specific information about the nature of these islands is provided. step 2: the hypothesis, 'the deserted islands', does not contradict the premise, but it is not a logical consequence of it. deserted islands are a subset of islands, but not all islands are deserted. therefore, the hypothesis cannot be logically inferred from the premise. step 3: based on the given information, the hypothesis 'the deserted islands' is not entailed by the premise 'the islands and their people'."
5930,working on a carnival that's going to be in a couple of weeks for our school and i'm thinking that this has been a pretty you know rainy season it's been scary it's of kind of been cloudy every day and i thought well i'm just not anxious to have worry about the weather,It's been a dry year so far.,0,0,True,"step 1: in the premise, the speaker mentions that it has been a rainy season and that they are anxious about the weather for an upcoming carnival. they express that it has been cloudy every day. step 2: the hypothesis states that it has been a dry year so far. however, the information in the premise contradicts the hypothesis, as the speaker explicitly states that it has been a rainy season. step 3: based on the given premise, the hypothesis 'it's been a dry year so far' cannot be logically inferred as it contradicts the information provided in the premise."
5931,An offer to do what he did in 1986 once again would command widespread support.,"Since offering to repeat his actions from 1986, he lost a lot of support.",0,0,True,"step 1: in the premise, it is stated that an offer to repeat an action from 1986 would receive widespread support. this implies that the individual's actions from 1986 were well-received or successful. step 2: the hypothesis suggests that since making the offer to repeat his actions, he lost a lot of support. this directly contradicts the premise, as losing support is the opposite of 'widespread support'. step 3: based on the contradiction between the premise and hypothesis, it is clear that the hypothesis cannot be logically inferred from the premise.step 4: it is essential to consider contextual factors, common sense, and logical principles when analyzing the relationship between premises and hypotheses. in this case, the premise and hypothesis present contradictory information. thus, the hypothesis cannot be logically inferred from the premise."
5932,"When built, these mills were within the counties of Kent, Surrey, Middlesex, Hertfordshire or Essex.","When built, these mills were within the counties of Kent, Surrey, Middlesex, Meretum or Essex.",1,0,False,"step 1. in the premise, the key information is that the mills were built in specific counties (kent, surrey, middlesex, hertfordshire, essex). no logical connections or commonsense understanding are required to identify this information. step 2. in the hypothesis, the difference lies in one county name (meretum instead of middlesex). this does not contradict the premise as meretum is not explicitly mentioned as a non-county. common sense does not provide a definitive answer, as meretum might be a typo or an alternative name for one of the mentioned counties. step 3. given the absence of contradiction and the possibility that meretum could be a valid county name, the hypothesis is not logically impossible to infer from the premise. however, the hypothesis cannot be confirmed as entailed by the premise until we have additional information confirming the existence and location of the county of meretum."
5933,yeah and i i did the family thing so my sweetie could go too,My sweetie and I enjoyed going there and working out together.,1,1,True,"step 1: in the premise, the speaker mentions doing 'the family thing' to allow 'my sweetie' to go with them. this implies that the speaker and 'my sweetie' went to a place or participated in an activity together as a family. step 2: the hypothesis states that 'my sweetie and i enjoyed going there and working out together'. this hypothesis is consistent with the premise as it also describes an enjoyment of an activity by the speaker and 'my sweetie' together. step 3: based on the logical consistency and the common sense understanding that going to a place or participating in an activity together can involve enjoying each other's company, the hypothesis can be inferred from the premise.step 4: an additional perspective to consider is the implication of 'working out' in the hypothesis. while the premise does not explicitly state that they were working out, it is reasonable to assume that engaging in 'the family thing' could involve physical activities, including working out. therefore, the hypothesis that they enjoyed working out together can also be seen as a more specific interpretation of 'enjoying going there together' mentioned in the premise.step 5: in summary, the hypothesis can be logically inferred from the premise, as it is a reasonable and necessary implication of the information provided in the premise."
5934,Plato's girlfriend is worried the former actress is on a downward spiral to death.,Plato's girlfriend is confident that the former actress will make it out of this perfectly fine. ,0,0,True,"step 1: the premise describes plato's girlfriend's concern about the former actress's health. this concern implies a perceived danger or risk to the actress's wellbeing. step 2: the hypothesis, however, states that plato's girlfriend is confident in the actress's ability to overcome her current situation. these two statements contradict each other, as confidence implies a lack of worry or concern. step 3: based on the logical contradiction between the premise and hypothesis, the hypothesis cannot be logically inferred from the premise."
5935,right right sounds like they have a young guy that they're putting a lot of weight into uh that Juan Gonzalez yeah,"They are completely neglecting their young guy, Gonzalez.",0,0,True,"step 1: in the premise, it is stated that 'they' (an unidentified group) are putting a 'lot of weight' into 'a young guy' named juan gonzalez. this implies that they are investing significant resources or attention into him. step 2: the hypothesis, however, suggests the opposite - 'they are completely neglecting' gonzalez. this contradicts the information given in the premise, as the two statements cannot both be true. step 3: based on the logical inconsistency between the premise and hypothesis, the hypothesis cannot be inferred from the premise.step 4: it's important to note that without more context, it's impossible to definitively determine the actual situation regarding juan gonzalez. the premise might not provide the full picture, and there could be other factors at play that might explain why the group appears to be putting a lot of weight into him while also neglecting him. inferences based on incomplete or inadequate information can be misleading or incorrect."
5937,"After some work to make her visitor-friendly, she lowered her gangplank to the public in October 1998.",It was dangerous to use before work was done on it.,1,0,False,"step 1: in the premise, 'she' refers to a ship, and 'lowered her gangplank to the public' means making the ship accessible to visitors. the action 'making her visitor-friendly' implies improvements or repairs to ensure safety. october 1998 is mentioned as the month when this happened. step 2: the hypothesis suggests that the gangplank was dangerous before the improvements were made. however, the premise states that the work was done 'to make her visitor-friendly', which implies that the improvements were necessary to ensure safety. therefore, it contradicts the hypothesis that the gangplank was dangerous before the work was done. step 3: based on the logical contradiction between the premise and hypothesis, the hypothesis cannot be inferred from the premise."
5939,"Initially, the two groups were kept apart and unaware of each other.",The two groups consisted of three people in each group.,1,0,False,"step 1: in the premise, it is stated that there were initially two groups, which were kept apart and unaware of each other. this information does not provide any specific details about the number of people in each group. however, it is a common assumption that a 'group' typically consists of more than one person.  step 2: the hypothesis, 'the two groups consisted of three people in each group', adds a specific detail about the number of people in each group but doesn't contradict the premise. it is a reasonable assumption that a 'group' of three people can be considered a 'group'. step 3: however, the premise does not provide enough information to logically infer that each group consisted of exactly three people. the hypothesis, while possible, goes beyond the information given in the premise. therefore, the hypothesis is not entailed by the premise.step 4: it's important to note that making assumptions about the number of people in a group, without explicit information, carries an inherent degree of uncertainty. while 'three people' is a common assumption for a 'group', other group sizes are also possible. the premise itself does not limit the group sizes, and additional context or information might be needed to make a more definitive conclusion."
5940,"If the request is canceled before it reaches its destination, the water is diverted to Brock Reservoir for storage.","If the request is changed or canceled before it reaches its destination, the water is diverted to Brock Reservoir for storage.",1,1,True,"step 1: in the premise, the condition for diverting water to brock reservoir is the request being 'canceled before it reaches its destination'. the hypothesis offers a similar condition but uses 'changed or canceled'. step 2: the key difference between the two conditions is that 'canceled' implies the removal of the request, while 'changed' implies an alteration of the request. however, changing a request does not necessarily result in its cancellation. but, based on the given context, it is reasonable to assume that a change in request would also lead to the same outcome, as both conditions (canceled and changed) imply that the request does not reach its destination. this is because the premise states that the water diversion occurs 'before it reaches its destination'. a change in request would also prevent the request from reaching its destination. step 3: based on this logical reasoning, the hypothesis can be inferred from the premise, as a change in request (implicitly cancels the original request) which in turn would result in the water being diverted to brock reservoir."
5941,One man in a helm shaped like a snarling dog fought another taller dark man with a chain.,A tall dark man fled for safety.,0,0,True,"step 1: the premise describes a scene where two men are engaged in a fight. one man is described as being in a helm shaped like a snarling dog, suggesting he may be wearing a mask or helmet with a dog design. the other man is described as taller and dark. there are no explicit indications of fleeing or safety in the premise. step 2: the hypothesis suggests that one of the men, specifically the 'taller dark man,' has fled for safety. while there is no direct evidence in the premise that this man has fled, it is not explicitly contradicted either. it's also common sense that people might choose to flee when facing a dangerous situation, like a fight. step 3: based on the given information, logical principles, and common-sense reasoning, the hypothesis is not directly entailed by the premise as there is no explicit mention of the 'taller dark man' fleeing in the premise. however, it is possible, given the context and assumptions about human behavior."
5942,"A man with the name tag ""Chris"" who is wearing a blue shirt with blue-white striped tie, presses his hand at his forehead.",The name tag says Bill,0,0,True,"step 1: in the premise, we have detailed information about a man named chris, including his attire with a blue shirt and blue-white striped tie, and an action of pressing his hand to his forehead. there is no direct mention or implication of a name tag with the name 'bill'.  step 2: the hypothesis, 'the name tag says bill', is not logically entailed from the premise. the hypothesis contradicts the given information that the name tag says 'chris'. step 3: based on the logical analysis and the contradiction between the premise and hypothesis, the hypothesis is not entailed by the premise."
5943,sort of a building season season yeah,The time for major construction projects.,1,1,True,"step 1: in the premise, 'sort of a building season' is ambiguous and does not provide enough clear information to make a definitive conclusion. however, the term 'building season' generally refers to a time of year when major construction projects can be carried out due to favorable weather conditions or other factors.step 2: the hypothesis, 'the time for major construction projects', aligns with the meaning of 'building season'. major construction projects are indeed the focus of such a season. the hypothesis is a more specific and clear statement about the same concept as the premise.step 3: based on the logical relationship between the premise and hypothesis, the hypothesis can be inferred from the premise as it provides a more precise description of the same concept."
5944,An elderly woman crafts a design on a loom.,The woman is making pizza.,0,0,True,"step 1: in the premise, an elderly woman is engaged in the activity of crafting a design on a loom. this implies that she is weaving, which is a process of creating fabric. the verb 'crafts' suggests a creative and artistic endeavor. step 2: the hypothesis, on the other hand, suggests an entirely different scenario where the woman is making pizza. there is no logical or factual connection between the premise and hypothesis. step 3: given the information provided in the premise and hypothesis, it is not possible to logically infer that the woman is making pizza from the premise."
5945,and if we were there like in the middle of the summer it's unair-conditioned it was dusty and dirty um there was like a fan at the very end of the row and that was it and so we didn't really know we weren't supposed to we thought TI dress code was just dress appropriate to your job we wore shorts we didn't know that was a big no no,We also had sneakers on with our shorts.,1,1,True,"step 1: the premise describes a situation where the speakers were working in an unair-conditioned, dusty, and dirty environment. they were dressed appropriately for their jobs, wearing shorts, but were not aware of a specific dress code prohibiting shorts. no information is provided about their footwear. step 2: the hypothesis extends the description of their attire by stating that they also wore sneakers. this additional detail does not contradict the information in the premise but can be logically inferred if we assume that the speakers wore sneakers with their shorts, which is a common practice for comfort and convenience in similar work environments. step 3: based on the lack of contradictory information and the logical extension of the described scenario, the hypothesis can be inferred from the premise."
5946,"No matter how hard I try, I feel that I say the wrong thing or something inappropriate.",I always know what to say in front of people.,0,0,True,"step 1: in the premise, the speaker expresses a feeling of inadequacy in choosing the right words or appropriate things to say in social situations. this is a common human experience and does not contradict any factual information.step 2: the hypothesis suggests that the speaker is always able to say the right thing in front of people, which is the opposite of what is stated in the premise. this contradicts the premise and cannot be logically inferred from it.step 3: based on the logical reasoning, common sense, and the contradictory nature of the hypothesis to the premise, the hypothesis is not entailed by the premise."
5947,uh-huh yeah that's true yeah and with age comes you know the the i'm sure arthritis sets in with them you know right yeah,"As i get older , i notice more signs of arthritis.",1,1,True,"step 1: the premise discusses the age-related condition of arthritis setting in animals, especially. it implies that as animals age, they are likely to experience arthritis. step 2: the hypothesis states that as the speaker gets older, they notice more signs of arthritis. this relates directly to the premise as the speaker is an animal (a human) and aging is the common factor between the premise and hypothesis. step 3: the hypothesis can be logically inferred from the premise as the premise sets up the expectation that aging animals will show signs of arthritis, and the hypothesis states that the speaker (an aging animal) is noticing these signs. therefore, the hypothesis is a logical consequence of the premise."
5948,"MC73-1, Phase I, Opinion and Recommended Decision, April 15, 1976; accepted in Decision of the Governors of the United States Postal Service on Establishing a Mail Classification Schedule, June 2, 1976.","MC73-1, Phase I, Opinion and Recommended Decision dates back to 1976, according to the article.",1,1,True,"step 1: in the premise, there is a clear statement of the date when the 'mc73-1, phase i, opinion and recommended decision' was accepted - june 2, 1976. the hypothesis also states that the document is from 1976.step 2: the hypothesis is a logical consequence of the premise, as it only changes the phrasing of the known fact. the hypothesis ' mc73-1, phase i, opinion and recommended decision dates back to 1976' is equivalent to the premise 'mc73-1, phase i, opinion and recommended decision was accepted in decision of the governors of the united states postal service on establishing a mail classification schedule on june 2, 1976'.step 3: given the logical equivalence of the premise and the hypothesis, the hypothesis is entailed by the premise."
5949,It was written in 1868.,It was written in 1868 but had to wait until 1945 for a full staging.,1,0,False,"step 1: the premise establishes a fact about the writing's origin in 1868. this information does not contradict common sense or any known facts. step 2: the hypothesis adds the detail that the writing had to wait until 1945 for a full staging, but it does not alter or contradict the premise's core statement about the writing's authorship date. step 3: the hypothesis can be seen as expanding or providing additional context to the premise, rather than contradicting or altering it. therefore, the hypothesis is not logically entailed by the premise, but it is compatible and consistent with it. step 4: the hypothesis does not follow directly from the premise, but it can be seen as related to it through the shared context of the writing's history.step 5: based on the logical reasoning and the consistency between the premise and hypothesis, the hypothesis is not logically entailed by the premise, but they can co-exist in the same logical framework."
5950,"For the upcoming world championships in microhockey, a super-vaccine was to be developed, which would be administered to all participants and audience members.",A super-vaccine was being developed to keep people attending the world championships from falling ill with the disease.,1,1,True,"step 1: in the premise, it is mentioned that a super-vaccine is to be developed and administered to all participants and audience members for the upcoming world championships in microhockey. this implies that there is a concern about the spread of a disease during the event.step 2: the hypothesis states that a super-vaccine is being developed to keep people from falling ill with the disease. this is directly related to the premise as both describe the development and use of a super-vaccine in the context of preventing illness during the world championships.step 3: the hypothesis can be logically inferred from the premise since the premise states that the super-vaccine is being developed for the purpose of preventing illness at the event, and the hypothesis states that the super-vaccine is being developed to achieve the same goal.therefore, based on the logical relationship between the premise and hypothesis, the common-sense assumption that a super-vaccine is developed to prevent illness, and the lack of contradictory information, the hypothesis can be inferred from the premise."
5951,He pulled his cloak tighter and wished for a moment that he had not shaved his head.,The man wrapped himself in hos cloak because of the blustering winds and bitter cold outside that evening. ,1,1,True,"step 1: in the premise, the man's actions are described as pulling his cloak tighter and wishing he hadn't shaved his head. the former action implies that it's cold, and the latter suggests discomfort or unease, possibly due to the weather. step 2: the hypothesis posits that the man wrapped himself in his cloak because of the blustering winds and bitter cold outside. this explanation is consistent with the information provided in the premise, as it further elaborates on the cold conditions that might have necessitated the man's action of pulling his cloak tighter. step 3: based on the logical consistency and common sense understanding of the information provided in both the premise and hypothesis, the hypothesis can be inferred from the premise."
5952,"Title 7 identifies the following steps of the acquisition and payment process involving general  (1) purchase authorization (the ordering function), (2) receipt and acceptance of the items ordered,",The ordering and payment process under Title 7 is summarized in one succinct step. ,0,0,True,"step 1: in the premise, title 7 outlines two distinct steps in the ordering and payment process - purchase authorization and receipt and acceptance of items ordered. these steps represent separate actions, one leading to the other but not equivalent. step 2: the hypothesis suggests that these two steps are summarized in one succinct step, which is a logical contradiction to the premise. the premise specifies two separate steps, and it is not possible to logically infer from the premise that these two steps are summarized in one. step 3: based on the logical analysis, the hypothesis cannot be inferred from the premise."
5953,oh okay um-hum exactly and it seems like everything is raising every everything that can be cigarette not that i smoke but cigarettes,Cigarettes are bad for you.,1,1,True,"step 1: in the premise, the speaker is acknowledging that cigarettes are something that can be raised (grown or produced), and they also mention that 'it seems like everything is raising everything that can be cigarette' which implies that cigarettes have negative consequences. this is a common understanding and is factually consistent. the hypothesis is also factually correct, as cigarettes are indeed bad for human health. step 2: the hypothesis 'cigarettes are bad for you' logically follows from the premise because the premise acknowledges that cigarettes have negative consequences. step 3: based on the logical reasoning, factual consistency, and common understanding, the hypothesis can be inferred from the premise."
5954,"As with many other Gothic masterpieces, the name of the first architect is unknown, but the renowned Pierre de Montreuil is credited with much of the 13th-century construction.",This building is not considered to be a part of the Gothic style.,0,0,True,"step 1: the premise provides information about the origins of the building, stating that the identity of the first architect is unknown but that pierre de montreuil is credited with much of the construction during the 13th century. it also mentions that the building is a gothic masterpiece. step 2: the hypothesis states that the building is not considered to be a part of the gothic style. however, the premise explicitly states that the building is, in fact, a gothic masterpiece. step 3: given the information in the premise and the contradictory nature of the hypothesis, it is clear that the hypothesis cannot be logically inferred from the premise. step 4: the hypothesis directly contradicts the premise, which makes it an incorrect assumption."
5955,We know essentially nothing about life beyond Earth.,We know everything about life beyond Earth. ,0,0,True,"step 1: in the premise, it is stated that we know essentially nothing about life beyond earth. this means that our current knowledge and understanding of life in other parts of the universe is extremely limited. step 2: in the hypothesis, it is claimed that we know everything about life beyond earth. however, the hypothesis directly contradicts the premise, as it asserts a level of knowledge that is not supported by the available information. step 3: based on the logical principle that a hypothesis cannot be logically inferred from a premise that contradicts it, the hypothesis is not entailed by the premise.step 4: it is important to note that the lack of knowledge about life beyond earth does not imply that there is no life beyond earth, only that our current understanding does not extend to that realm. the hypothesis makes a much stronger claim, asserting that we possess complete knowledge on the subject, which is not justified by the premise.step 5: in conclusion, given the contradictory relationship between the premise and hypothesis, the hypothesis is not logically entailed by the premise."
5956,Two Olympic martial arts competitors go after each other in an international martial arts spectacle.,A man is cleaning and polishing a large candy dish.,0,0,True,"step 1. the premise describes a scene of two martial arts competitors engaging in a competition at the olympics. the context does not provide any information about a candy dish or a man cleaning it. step 2. the hypothesis is not logically related to the premise as there is no connection or implication of a man cleaning and polishing a large candy dish in the context of the premise. step 3. based on the lack of logical connection and the absence of any fact or inference that could lead from the premise to the hypothesis, the hypothesis is not entailed by the premise."
5957,well like my younger brothers and sisters at home like when it starts getting nice outside in the summer and everything she'll she makes us go outside even now when i go home for the summer she makes us go outside and we're allowed to come in and watch TV until it's dark because she doesn't like the TV herself,She never lets us go outside. ,0,0,True,"step 1: in the premise, the speaker describes their mother making them go outside during nice weather, but they are allowed to come back in and watch tv until it's dark. this implies that there is a rule or restriction regarding going outside during certain hours, but it does not state that they are never allowed to go outside. common sense suggests that being allowed to go outside at all, even with restrictions, contradicts the hypothesis of 'never'. step 2: the hypothesis is inconsistent with the premise because the premise states that the mother allows the children to go outside, even if it's only during certain hours. step 3: based on the logical reasoning and the inconsistency with the premise, the hypothesis is not entailed by the premise."
5958,Natalia/Lincoln began fiddling with his/her top-hat.,Lincoln didn't touch the hat.,0,0,True,"step 1: the premise describes an action 'fiddling' performed by 'lincoln' on an object identified as 'his/her top-hat'. this action suggests some form of interaction with the hat. step 2: the hypothesis states 'lincoln didn't touch the hat'. the absence of 'touch' in the premise does not contradict this statement, but it does not entail it either. the hypothesis is not a logical consequence of the premise based on the given information alone. step 3: the hypothesis 'lincoln didn't touch the hat' is not entailed by the premise 'natalia/lincoln began fiddling with his/her top-hat'."
5959,"It charts the history of Scotland, bringing under one roof a number of important collections of artifacts.","The museum is about Scotland's future, not past.",0,0,True,"step 1. the premise describes a museum that showcases the history of scotland and gathers various collections of artifacts under one roof. this implies that the museum focuses on the past.step 2. the hypothesis states that the museum is about scotland's future, not past. this is directly contradictory to the information given in the premise.step 3. based on the logical relationship between the premise and hypothesis, the hypothesis cannot be logically inferred from the premise."
5960,A rural route is defined in terms of the roads it traverses.,A rural route only describes the general area that it travels through.,0,0,True,"step 1: in the premise, a rural route is defined as a collection of roads it traverses. the definition provides specific information about what a rural route is. step 2: the hypothesis, on the other hand, describes a rural route in more general terms, focusing on the geographical area it covers, rather than the roads it consists of. step 3: the hypothesis is not logically entailed by the premise because the premise only specifies the roads a rural route takes, while the hypothesis adds an additional detail about the route's general area. the hypothesis could still be true, but it goes beyond the information provided in the premise. step 4: however, it is essential to note that the hypothesis does not contradict the premise. a rural route being defined by the roads it takes does not exclude the possibility that it also describes the general area it travels through. thus, the hypothesis could be true in addition to the premise. step 5: while the hypothesis is not directly entailed by the premise, there is no contradiction between them. therefore, the label should be 0 for no entailment."
5961,"Although the personal saving rate is low, economists do not agree on whether this is a problem or whether private saving is inadequate to finance domestic investment.",Many financial advisers recommend saving twenty percent of your income.,1,0,False,"step 1: in the premise, it is stated that the personal saving rate is low, and economists have varying opinions on whether this is a problem and if private savings are adequate for financing domestic investment. this suggests a complex economic issue with ongoing debate. the hypothesis, 'many financial advisers recommend saving twenty percent of your income,' is about personal financial advice, not directly related to the economy or saving rates.step 2: the hypothesis is not logically entailed by the premise. the premise discusses economic debates about the significance of a low saving rate and adequacy of private savings for investment, whereas the hypothesis is about financial advisers' recommendations.step 3: based on the logical analysis, the hypothesis is not entailed by the premise."
5962,He says he brought the proposal for professional parachute helmets with an air-bag system.',He didn't buy the helmet proposal.,0,0,True,"step 1: in the premise, 'he says he brought the proposal' implies that he presented or introduced the proposal for professional parachute helmets with an air-bag system. this is different from actually purchasing the proposal or making a commitment to buy it. step 2: the hypothesis 'he didn't buy the helmet proposal' contradicts the premise as it suggests that no purchase was made, while the premise indicates that he brought the proposal. step 3: based on the information provided, the hypothesis cannot be logically inferred from the premise as they represent contradictory statements."
5963,well uh lately since i have children i've cut down on having dinner parties but  when i do i try to keep it pretty simple on things that i can prepare ahead of time,I still have lots and lots of dinner parties.,0,0,True,"step 1: in the premise, the speaker mentions that they have children and have cut down on having dinner parties. they also mention that when they do have dinner parties, they try to keep things simple and prepare food ahead of time. step 2: the hypothesis contradicts the information provided in the premise, as it suggests that the speaker has 'lots and lots' of dinner parties. the frequency of dinner parties described in the hypothesis is not consistent with the information provided in the premise. step 3: based on the logical reasoning and the contradictory nature of the hypothesis to the premise, the hypothesis cannot be inferred from the premise."
5964,"We are asked to feel especially sorry for Richard Nixon, who endured vilification from the New York Times and Washington Post that was continual, venomous, unscrupulous, inventive, and sometimes unlawful.",This characterization was entirely unfair and Richard Nixon deserved better.,1,1,True,"step 1: in the premise, it is stated that nixon was subjected to harsh treatment from the new york times and washington post. the adjectives used to describe the treatment - continual, venomous, unscrupulous, inventive, and sometimes unlawful - imply a high degree of intensity and possibly unjustifiable nature. step 2: the hypothesis asserts that the characterization of nixon was entirely unfair and that he deserved better. this is consistent with the premise, as the premise implies that the treatment nixon received was beyond what was reasonable or justified. step 3: based on the logical consistency between the premise and hypothesis, and the lack of contradictory information, the hypothesis can be inferred from the premise.step 4: it is important to note that while the hypothesis can be logically inferred from the premise, it does not necessarily mean that it is factually correct. the premise only provides information about the treatment nixon received and does not provide evidence to definitively prove or disprove the fairness or unfairness of that treatment.therefore, the final conclusion would depend on the context and additional evidence available."
5965,"Three centuries later, not that much has changed ' a score of international banks have their offices here, along with celebrated jewelers, the Ministry of Justice, and the Ritz Hotel.",Only local banks are allowed to do business in the city.,0,0,True,"step 1: in the premise, it is stated that 'three centuries later,' there are international banks, celebrated jewelers, the ministry of justice, and the ritz hotel present in the city. this implies a bustling business district with various types of businesses, including international ones. step 2: the hypothesis 'only local banks are allowed to do business in the city' contradicts the information given in the premise as it suggests that only local banks are present, while the premise states that international banks are also present. step 3: based on the given information, the hypothesis cannot be logically inferred from the premise as it contradicts it."
5966,The actual amounts are $84 for childless couples and $883 for a couple with one child.,A childless couple receives more than a couple with one child,0,0,True,"step 1: analyze the given information in the premise. the premise states the actual amounts for a childless couple and a couple with one child. the amounts are $84 for the childless couple and $883 for the couple with one child.step 2: compare the given amounts to determine if the hypothesis can be logically inferred. the hypothesis states that a childless couple receives more than a couple with one child. however, based on the information provided in the premise, this is not the case. in fact, the opposite is true, as the couple with one child receives more than the childless couple.step 3: based on the logical comparison of the given information and the hypothesis, the hypothesis is not logically entailed by the premise."
5967,"Bees buzzed around in the summer heat, robbing children of sugar and ice-cream.",The bees were all dead.,0,0,True,"step 1: the premise describes bees buzzing around in the summer heat, suggesting that they are active. the phrase 'robbing children of sugar and ice-cream' is a figurative expression, likely referring to bees collecting nectar from flowers. this is a common behavior for bees. step 2: the hypothesis states that all the bees were dead. this directly contradicts the information given in the premise. bees cannot buzz around and 'rob' children of ice-cream if they are dead. step 3: based on the logical reasoning, the hypothesis cannot be inferred from the premise as it contradicts the information provided."
5968,"These include learning physical and mental control through yoga exercises, and also prayer and meditation rituals such as repeating certain phrases, or mantras, and concentrating on geometric designs called mandalas.",Yoga is the best exercise to train the mind and body.,1,1,True,"step 1: in the premise, yoga is presented as a practice that involves both physical exercises and mental disciplines such as prayer, meditation, and the use of geometric designs. these practices aim to provide learning and control for both the mind and body. step 2: the hypothesis asserts that yoga is the best exercise for training the mind and body. based on the information provided in the premise, it can be inferred that yoga is an effective practice for achieving this goal since the described components of the practice (physical exercises, meditation, and focus on geometric designs) are all geared towards improving both mental and physical control. step 3: the hypothesis can be reasonably inferred from the premise, as the premise establishes yoga as a comprehensive practice that addresses both aspects, and the hypothesis highlights the specific benefit of yoga in training the mind and body."
5969,The opportunities that the island had to offer were never really exploited by the Spanish.,The island had some opportunities that the Spanish missed.,1,1,True,"step 1: in the premise, it is stated that the opportunities that the island had to offer were not fully exploited by the spanish. this implies that there were indeed opportunities present on the island, but they were not utilized to their full potential. step 2: the hypothesis suggests that some opportunities on the island were missed by the spanish. this is a logical consequence of the premise, as it acknowledges that opportunities existed but were not fully utilized. step 3: the hypothesis 'the island had some opportunities that the spanish missed' is a more specific instance of the opportunities mentioned in the premise 'the opportunities that the island had to offer were never really exploited by the spanish'. the hypothesis can be inferred from the premise as it is a logical consequence of the information presented."
5970,I would expect the legal community to be in the forefront of trying to bring this issue to light.,The legal community has not acted sufficiently to bring this issue to light. ,1,0,False,"step 1: in the premise, it is stated that the legal community is expected to take action in bringing an issue to light. this implies that the legal community has a responsibility or duty to address this matter. step 2: the hypothesis states that the legal community has not acted sufficiently in bringing the issue to light. this directly contradicts the expectation stated in the premise. step 3: however, the lack of action does not necessarily mean that the legal community cannot or will not ever take action. the premise only sets an expectation, not a guarantee. the hypothesis does not logically follow from the premise, as it introduces a negative statement about the present situation, which is not explicitly stated in the premise. step 4: it is important to note that the premise and hypothesis may still be consistent if there are other factors or circumstances that explain why the legal community has not yet acted sufficiently. for instance, it could be due to resource constraints, lack of evidence, or political considerations. thus, the hypothesis does not entail that the premise is false, but rather that the premise's expectation has not yet been met.step 5: in summary, the hypothesis is not logically inferred from the premise, as the hypothesis introduces a contradiction to the expectation stated in the premise. however, the hypothesis does not necessarily contradict the factual information in the premise, as the premise only sets an expectation, not a guarantee."
5971,"With full automation, statistical sampling of invoices prior to payment to make inferences about the universe would no longer be necessary since the system would perform a 100percent verification of receipt and acceptance.",Statistical sampling happens before payments are made by insurance companies.,1,1,True,"step 1: in the premise, it is stated that with full automation, statistical sampling of invoices prior to payment would no longer be necessary because the system would perform a 100percent verification of receipt and acceptance. this implies that statistical sampling is a current practice used to make inferences about the universe (the entire set of invoices) before payments are made.step 2: in the hypothesis, it states that statistical sampling happens before payments are made by insurance companies. this is consistent with the information in the premise as statistical sampling is indeed a practice used before payments are made.step 3: based on the logical reasoning, the hypothesis can be inferred from the premise as the hypothesis describes a practice that is already mentioned and logically follows from the premise."
5972,"On the other hand, if a postal service is above breakeven, its routes will be even more profitable and hence, more attractive to cream skimmers.","If a postal service is a love breakeven, its routes will lose profits and look bad. ",0,0,True,"step 1. the premise states that if a postal service is above breakeven, its routes will become more profitable and attractive to cream skimmers. this implies that the postal service's financial health (being above breakeven) leads to increased competition and potential profit loss for other businesses. step 2. the hypothesis proposes a contradictory scenario where if a postal service is at breakeven, its routes will lose profits and look bad. this can neither be logically deduced nor inferred from the premise as the financial state of breakeven is different from being above breakeven, and the consequences described in the hypothesis are not suggested or implied by the premise. step 3. based on the logical analysis, the hypothesis cannot be inferred from the premise."
5973,no we usually don't do i mean they catch catfish i keep saying they because i never fish but um they catch catfish you on accident sometimes,I always catch catfish. ,0,0,True,"step 1: in the premise, it is mentioned that 'they' (presumably referring to fishermen) catch catfish 'you on accident sometimes'. this implies that catfish are among the species that can be caught during fishing, but it does not indicate that the speaker always catches catfish.step 2: the hypothesis, 'i always catch catfish', contradicts the information in the premise. the speaker explicitly states that they don't usually catch catfish but only catch them accidentally.step 3: based on the given information, the hypothesis is not logically entailed by the premise."
5974,Why blame her because she had been true to her creed? ,The woman blamed herself as well.,1,0,False,"step 1: in the premise, the statement 'why blame her because she had been true to her creed?' suggests that someone is blaming a woman for adhering to her beliefs or principles. the hypothesis, 'the woman blamed herself as well', introduces a new aspect of the woman's actions.step 2: the hypothesis does not contradict the premise, as the woman can still feel guilt or self-blame while being true to her beliefs, and the premise does not exclude this possibility. however, the premise does not logically entail the hypothesis, as the premise only describes external blame, not internal blame.step 3: based on the given information, it is not possible to determine if the hypothesis is logically entailed by the premise, as the premise does not provide enough information about the woman's thoughts or feelings.therefore, the label should be:'"
5975,"The two most clearly marked paths from Tanah Rata, easiest for the whole family, lead within an hour to a refreshing swim at Parit Falls or Robinson Falls.","There are many more paths from Tanah Rata, but they are difficult even for experienced climbers.",0,0,True,"step 1: in the premise, it is stated that there are two clearly marked paths from tanah rata, which are the easiest options for families and lead to refreshing swims at parit falls or robinson falls within an hour. this implies that these paths are well-known, safe, and relatively easy to navigate.step 2: the hypothesis suggests that there are many more paths from tanah rata, but they are difficult even for experienced climbers. this statement contradicts the premise, as it implies that there are numerous unmarked or challenging paths that are not suitable for families or even experienced climbers.step 3: based on the given information, the hypothesis cannot be logically inferred from the premise, as it contradicts the statement about the two easily accessible falls and the suitability of the paths for families and experienced climbers."
5977,Two little girls ride an inflatable dinghy down a purple water slide.,Barney Fife with his one bullet.,0,0,True,"step 1: in the premise, we have the description of two little girls riding an inflatable dinghy down a purple water slide. this scene involves water, inflatable objects, and children. there is no information about any characters named barney fife or bullets.step 2: the hypothesis 'barney fife with his one bullet' is not logically related to or entailed by the premise. barney fife is a fictional character known for his service as a deputy in the mayberry sheriff's department, and he is not mentioned or alluded to in the premise. the presence of a bullet in the hypothesis is also unrelated to the information provided in the premise.step 3: based on the logical analysis and the lack of connection between the premise and hypothesis, the hypothesis cannot be inferred from the premise."
5978,In what order?,In numerical order.,0,1,False,"step 1: the premise does not provide any specific information about the order of elements or objects. however, it is a common convention that 'in numerical order' implies a sequential arrangement based on numbers. step 2: the hypothesis 'in numerical order' can be inferred from the premise 'in what order?' as 'in what order' is a question asking for the correct arrangement of elements, and 'in numerical order' is one possible answer to such a question. if 'in what order' refers to a different type of order, the hypothesis might not be entailed. step 3: based on the given context and common conventions, the hypothesis 'in numerical order' can be reasonably inferred from the premise 'in what order?'"
5979,and that's that's really neat,I'm really disappointed in that.,0,0,True,"step 1: the premise is a statement of admiration or amazement, expressing positivity towards something. it does not provide any specific information about the subject or context. step 2: the hypothesis expresses a negative emotion, disappointment. these two statements are not logically related. while it is possible for someone to hold both a positive and negative emotion towards the same thing, the hypothesis does not follow logically from the premise. step 3: based on the given information and logical principles, there is no entailment between the premise and hypothesis."
5980,A woman in a white t-shirt points at a geyser.,The women points at the frozen glacier off the side of the cruise ship.,0,0,True,"step 1: in the premise, a woman is described as wearing a white t-shirt and pointing at a geyser. a geyser is a naturally occurring spring or fountain of geothermal water. no information is given about the location or context of this scene.step 2: in the hypothesis, a different woman is described as pointing at a frozen glacier, which is off the side of a cruise ship. a frozen glacier is an accumulation of ice formed from the freezing of seawater. a cruise ship is a large passenger vessel designed for ocean travel.step 3: the premise and hypothesis describe two distinct scenes. the woman in the premise is pointing at a geyser, while the woman in the hypothesis is pointing at a frozen glacier. there is no logical connection between these two scenes, and the hypothesis cannot be inferred from the premise based on the given information."
5981,i could sure tell the difference though after the first year or so of being there uh prior to,"The disparity had always been there, but grew more and more distinct as time passed. ",1,1,True,"step 1: in the premise, the speaker states that they could tell a difference after being there for a certain period of time, prior to which there was no mention of any difference. the hypothesis states that the disparity had always been there but grew more distinct over time.step 2: the hypothesis is consistent with the premise as it does not contradict any information given in the premise. it is a reasonable inference that the speaker might have noticed the difference gradually over time, even if it was present before they arrived.step 3: based on the logical reasoning and the lack of contradictory information, the hypothesis can be inferred from the premise."
5982,There are only two solutions.,There are many ways of doing this.,0,0,True,"step 1: in the premise, 'two solutions' refers to a limited number of options. this is a clear statement about the number of possibilities. in contrast, 'many ways' in the hypothesis implies a greater number of options. step 2: the hypothesis directly contradicts the premise because the hypothesis states that there are 'many ways' which is inconsistent with the premise stating that there are 'only two solutions'. step 3: based on the logical analysis, it's clear that the hypothesis cannot be inferred from the premise as they present contradictory information."
5983,"Holbrooke's U.N. nomination may be iced by Helms for a bit longer, but everyone agrees that he will be confirmed.",Holbrooke's nomination is getting pushed through rapidly.,0,0,True,"step 1: in the premise, it is mentioned that holbrooke's u.n. nomination may be delayed but everyone agrees that he will be confirmed. this implies that there is an initial delay in the confirmation process, but it is expected to continue eventually. step 2: the hypothesis, on the other hand, suggests a rapid progression of the confirmation process for holbrooke's nomination. however, the premise does not provide sufficient information to directly infer or logically deduce this rapid progression. step 3: based on the given information, the hypothesis is not entailed by the premise. the premise only indicates that there will be a confirmation for holbrooke's nomination, but it does not specify the speed or timeline of this confirmation process."
5984,"There is no pay, no reward, no fame, the fight will likely end in our deaths.",We were granted immortality. ,0,0,True,"step 1: in the premise, it is stated that there is no pay, no reward, and no fame, suggesting a dangerous or life-threatening situation. there is no mention of immortality or anything that could reasonably imply it. common sense and logical reasoning do not support the hypothesis given the provided premise.step 2: the hypothesis 'we were granted immortality' contradicts the premise 'there is no pay, no reward, no fame, the fight will likely end in our deaths'. the premise indicates a high risk of death, while the hypothesis asserts the opposite.step 3: based on the logical reasoning and the contradictory nature of the hypothesis to the premise, the hypothesis is not entailed by the premise."
5985,yeah and i like uh Totally Hidden Video,Totally Hidden Video isn't very good.,0,0,True,"step 1: in the given example, the premise is a statement expressing a personal preference, 'i like ...', and does not provide any information about the quality or merit of 'totally hidden video'. the hypothesis, 'totally hidden video isn't very good', makes a judgment about the quality of the video.step 2: personal preferences do not logically entail facts or judgments about the merit of an object. there isn't enough information from the premise to infer the hypothesis.step 3: based on the given information, the hypothesis cannot be logically inferred from the premise."
5986,Gore is a born-again Baptist who regularly invokes biblical verse on the stump.,Gore is not religious.,0,0,True,"step 1: in the premise, it is stated that gore is a born-again baptist and that he regularly invokes biblical verse during his speeches. this information suggests that gore is a religious person. step 2: the hypothesis, 'gore is not religious,' contradicts the information provided in the premise. step 3: based on the contradiction between the premise and hypothesis, the hypothesis cannot be logically inferred from the premise."
5987,"While their grant applications may not have the methodologic design that study sections composed of alcohol research specialists are accustomed to, funding such research will lead to the development of research methodologies appropriate to the emergency department setting.",The research specialists found their grant applications to be the norm.,0,0,True,"step 1: in the premise, it is stated that the grant applications from researchers in the emergency department setting do not follow the methodologic design preferred by study sections of alcohol research specialists. however, it is also suggested that funding these applications will lead to the development of research methodologies suitable for the emergency department context. this implies that the methodologies currently used may not be the most effective or efficient, but they can evolve and improve with funding and support.step 2: the hypothesis, stating that the grant applications were the norm for the research specialists, contradicts the premise. the premise indicates that the grant applications do not conform to the expectations of the study sections, meaning they are not the norm.step 3: based on the information provided, the hypothesis cannot be logically inferred from the premise. the premise describes the current state of affairs, while the hypothesis suggests a different, contrary state. therefore, the hypothesis is not entailed by the premise."
5988,"Here you'll see the delightful but slowly disappearing indigenous FWI costume madras turban, madras skirt over petticoat, silk peplum, white blouse, and gold earrings, bracelets, and collier-choux necklace.",FWI's indigenous costume is disappearing because young people prefer to wear T-shirts and jeans.,1,0,False,"step 1: in the premise, we have a description of the fwi (federation of women's institutions) indigenous costume, which includes various items such as a madras turban, madras skirt, silk peplum, white blouse, gold earrings, bracelets, and collier-choux necklace. no information is provided regarding why the costume is disappearing.step 2: the hypothesis suggests that the disappearance of fwi's indigenous costume is due to young people preferring to wear t-shirts and jeans. this is a possible explanation, but it is not directly related to the information provided in the premise.step 3: based on the given information, the hypothesis cannot be logically inferred from the premise as the premise does not provide enough context or information about the reasons for the disappearance of the fwi costume. it is possible that other factors could be contributing to the disappearance of the costume that are not mentioned in the premise. without this additional context, it is not possible to determine if the hypothesis is entailed by the premise or not."
5989,The primary goal of this gathering was to address issues generated by LSC's State Planning Initiative and resulting mergers.,The primary goal was to address issues generated by the planing initiative for probono clinics.,1,0,False,"step 1: in the premise, the gathering is stated to have been held with the primary goal of addressing issues generated by lsc's state planning initiative and resulting mergers. this implies that the issues were related to the planning initiative and the mergers that followed. step 2: the hypothesis suggests an alternative primary goal, which is addressing issues generated by the planning initiative for probono clinics. while probono clinics are a part of lsc's initiatives, this goal is not explicitly stated in the premise. however, the premise does not contradict the hypothesis, as the issues for probono clinics could have been a part of the broader state planning initiative mentioned. step 3: based on the given information, the hypothesis is not logically entailed by the premise, as the premise does not explicitly state the goal regarding probono clinics. however, the hypothesis is not contradictory to the premise either, and it could be possible that the issues for probono clinics were indeed the primary focus of the gathering, even though it's not explicitly stated in the premise."
5990,A group of women in white robes walk through the grass.,women walk through the sand,0,0,True,"step 1: in the premise, it is stated that a group of women walk through the grass. grass is a type of vegetation commonly found in various environments, including beaches. however, the type of surface the women are walking on is not directly relevant to the main action described in the sentence. 'walking through' could mean moving across any type of terrain.step 2: the hypothesis suggests a different type of terrain - sand. while the premise doesn't explicitly state that the women are walking through sand, it doesn't contradict this hypothesis either. sand is a common surface found in many places, including beaches and deserts, and women can easily walk on sand.step 3: based on the given information, the hypothesis is not logically entailed by the premise, as the premise does not specify the type of terrain with enough detail to infer the hypothesis. the hypothesis could be true, but it is not a direct result of the information in the premise."
5991,"In other words, we're not producing 30 percent more, but more of what we do produce goes to corporate profits and less to wages?",We spend more on wages than profits.,0,0,True,"step 1: in the premise, it is stated that 'more of what we do produce goes to corporate profits and less to wages'. this implies a shift in the proportion of production resources going towards wages and profits. however, it does not necessarily mean an absolute increase or decrease in the total amount of wages or profits.step 2: the hypothesis states 'we spend more on wages than profits'. this directly contradicts the premise as it suggests an absolute increase in wages while ignoring the shift in proportions.step 3: based on the logical analysis, the hypothesis cannot be inferred from the premise, as the premise does not provide sufficient evidence for the hypothesis. the hypothesis goes beyond the information given in the premise and contradicts it."
5992,"During his second term as an assemblyman, he contested the national House of Councillors election in 1989 as an independent but was defeated.","During his second term as an assemblyman, he contested the national House of Councillors election in 1980 as an independent but was defeated.",0,0,True,"step 1. the premise provides information about a specific election year (1989) during the second term of an assemblyman's tenure when he contested the house of councillors election as an independent and lost. step 2. the hypothesis suggests a different election year (1980) during his second term as an assemblyman when he contested the house of councillors election as an independent but was defeated. step 3. the premise does not logically entail the hypothesis, as the premise describes a specific election year (1989), while the hypothesis proposes a different year (1980). without additional context or facts, the hypothesis cannot be logically inferred from the premise."
5993,"As the name indicates, the show features comedy sketches with gay themes.","As the name indicates, the show features comedy sketches with gay themes or a gay twist.",1,1,True,"step 1: the premise states that the name of the show indicates that it features comedy sketches with gay themes. this implies that the show's content includes humor related to the experiences and identities of the lgbtq+ community. step 2: the hypothesis also states that the show features comedy sketches with gay themes or a gay twist. this is a more general statement than the premise, but it can be logically inferred from it. if the name implies 'gay themes,' then it also logically follows that there could be 'a gay twist' in the show, as 'gay themes' and 'gay twist' are related concepts. step 3: based on the logical relationship between the premise and hypothesis, and the lack of contradictory information, the hypothesis can be inferred from the premise."
5994,The Logic of Comparative Social Inquiry.,Social inquiries can't be compared.,0,0,True,"step 1: in the premise, 'the logic of comparative social inquiry' is a title of a book or a theoretical framework that outlines methods and principles for making logical comparisons in social inquiry. it does not provide specific information about a particular comparison or lack of comparison between social inquiries.step 2: the hypothesis, 'social inquiries can't be compared', is a negative statement that contradicts the general idea of the premise. however, a title or a theoretical framework does not logically entail every possible implication or conclusion. it is important to consider the content and context of specific instances of social inquiries to determine if they can be compared.step 3: without more context or specific information about the social inquiries in question, it is not possible to logically infer the hypothesis from the premise. the premise does not provide enough evidence to support the hypothesis, and the hypothesis contradicts the general idea of logical comparison implied in the premise."
5995,It really is too bad! ,I wish something could be done. ,1,0,False,"step 1: both sentences express regret or disappointment about a situation. there is no direct logical or factual connection between the two sentences. common sense does not provide a definitive answer as to whether the hypothesis can be inferred from the premise.step 2: the hypothesis 'i wish something could be done' is not logically entailed by the premise 'it really is too bad!' as it introduces a new element, an expression of a desire to take action.step 3: based on the given information, the hypothesis is not logically entailed by the premise."
5996,"While it makes no sense to worry that you are living well at your grandchildren's expense, you might legitimately worry that someone else is living well at your grandchildren's expense.",They are childless without an heir. ,0,0,True,"step 1: in the premise, the speaker expresses a concern that someone else might be living well at their grandchildren's expense. this implies that the grandchildren are expected to provide for others, possibly financially. however, the premise also acknowledges that it makes no sense to worry about the speakers' own living situation. the hypothesis introduces a new piece of information - that the grandchildren are childless without an heir. this information does not directly relate to the issue of someone else living well at the grandchildren's expense.step 2: the hypothesis cannot be logically inferred from the premise because the premise does not provide any information about the grandchildren's familial status or the potential individuals who might be living well at their expense.step 3: based on the given information, the hypothesis is not entailed by the premise."
5997,The parish of Warton had a population of 2315 recorded in the 2001 census.,"The parish of Warton had a population of 2315 recorded in the 2001 census, and 2,360 in the 2011 census.",1,0,False,"step 1: the premise provides the population figure for the parish of warton in the 2001 census. no information is given about the population in any other year. step 2: the hypothesis suggests that the population figure for the parish of warton in the 2001 census is the same as given in the premise, but it also includes an additional statement about the population in the 2011 census. the hypothesis does not contradict the premise, as the premise only provides information about the population in 2001. step 3: however, the hypothesis goes beyond the information given in the premise and provides new information that is not logically implied. the population figure for the year 2011 is not mentioned in the premise, so it cannot be logically inferred from it. therefore, the hypothesis is not entailed by the premise."
5998,The show is set in Kolkata.,"The show is set in Kolkata, but is filmed in Mumbai.",1,0,False,"step 1: in the premise, it is stated that the show is set in kolkata. this means that the story or events depicted in the show take place in kolkata. step 2: the hypothesis adds an additional detail that the show is filmed in mumbai. filming location is different from the show's setting. while the setting is where the story takes place, filming locations can be different due to various reasons such as budget, availability of facilities, etc. step 3: although the hypothesis provides an additional detail, it does not contradict the premise. in fact, it is a common occurrence for shows or movies to be filmed in locations different from their settings. therefore, the hypothesis cannot be logically inferred from the premise but can still be true. step 4: the label should be 0 as the hypothesis is not logically entailed by the premise."

6000,"Eventually, you're going to have to come back down to Earth.",You will have to return to Earth after you run out of food in the space shuttle.,1,1,True,"step 1: in the premise, it is suggested that there will be a point in time when someone (not specified) will need to return to earth. this implies a return journey from a location away from earth. step 2: the hypothesis states that a person will have to return to earth after running out of food in the space shuttle. this is a specific case of the more general premise, as it also indicates a return journey from a location away from earth. the reason for the return is different, but the action itself (returning to earth) is the same. step 3: based on the logical relationship between the premise and hypothesis, the hypothesis can be inferred from the premise."
1501,"Although Tarzan is now nominally in control, one suspects that Kala the Ape-Mom, the Empress Dowager of the Jungle, is really in charge.","Tarzan may strut around like the ruler of the jungle, but there are clues that it's Kala who is reigns supreme.",1,1,True,"step 1: in the premise, tarzan is described as nominally in control but with kala being the real power in the jungle. this implies that tarzan holds a title or position of authority, but his actions and decisions are influenced or overruled by kala. kala being the empress dowager also signifies her power and influence behind the scenes.step 2: the hypothesis 'tarzan may strut around like the ruler of the jungle, but there are clues that it's kala who is reigns supreme' is consistent with the premise as it highlights the contrast between tarzan's perceived authority and kala's actual power. the hypothesis does not contradict the premise but rather reinforces the idea that tarzan's control is only nominal.step 3: based on the logical consistency between the premise and hypothesis, and the lack of contradictory information, the hypothesis can be inferred from the premise."
1502,"Absently, Lincoln gestured to one of the policemen.","Lincoln waved his hand at the cop, telling him to come over.",1,1,True,"step 1: the premise describes an action by lincoln, identified as 'gestured', and the object of the gesture, identified as 'one of the policemen'. the word 'absently' provides context suggesting an absent-minded or distracted action. step 2: the hypothesis describes an action by lincoln that is similar in nature to the 'gesture' in the premise, but it is more specifically identified as a 'wave' and includes the additional information that lincoln was indicating for the policeman to come over. this is a reasonable inference based on the given context. step 3: based on the logical relationship between the two actions (gesture and wave), the common sense understanding of gestures and their meanings, and the context provided in the premise, the hypothesis can be inferred from the premise."
1503,"Perot's favorite candidate at the moment appears to be Buchanan, who has made noises about bolting the GOP and joining the Reform Party.",Perot is primarily interested in candidates who look like they will be able to shake up the system.,1,1,True,"step 1: in the premise, perot is shown to favor buchanan, who has expressed intentions to leave the gop and join another party. this indicates that perot is drawn to candidates who are willing to create change or disrupt the status quo. step 2: the hypothesis suggests that perot is interested in candidates who 'shake up the system'. this aligns with the information in the premise, as buchanan's actions fit the description of shaking up the political system. step 3: based on the logical connection between the premise and hypothesis, and the common sense understanding that perot's stated preference for buchanan demonstrates an interest in candidates capable of making changes, the hypothesis can be inferred from the premise."
1505,Little Tuppence.,Tuppence was known as Tuppence the Gigantic.,0,0,True,"step 1: in the given premise, 'little tuppence' is mentioned as a name for an individual. this name suggests that tuppence is of small size or stature. common sense and factual knowledge do not provide any additional context or information about tuppence's size that contradicts or supports the hypothesis.step 2: the hypothesis 'tuppence was known as tuppence the gigantic' contradicts the information given in the premise. 'gigantic' implies a large size, which is in direct opposition to 'little' or small size.step 3: based on the given information and the logical contradiction between the premise and hypothesis, the hypothesis is not entailed by the premise."
1506,The city is mostly made up of concrete blocks and row - housing.,"The city is mostly made up of concrete blocks and row-housing, but some people residing in Avedøre live in detached single-family houses with gardens.",1,1,True,"step 1: in the premise, the city is described as mostly made up of concrete blocks and row-housing. this means that the majority of buildings in the city follow this architectural style. step 2: the hypothesis adds additional information about some residents in avedøre living in detached single-family houses with gardens. although this contradicts the general description of the city, it does not negate the premise because the premise only describes the majority of the buildings. step 3: the hypothesis can be seen as a more specific or nuanced version of the premise, acknowledging the diversity within the city's residential landscape. since the hypothesis does not contradict the premise, but instead provides more detail, it can be considered a logical inference.step 4: it's important to note that the hypothesis does not state that all or even a majority of residents in avedøre live in detached houses, but rather that 'some people residing in avedøre' do so. this maintains the consistency of the premise, which only describes the city in general terms.therefore, the hypothesis can be inferred from the premise as it expands upon the given information without contradicting it."
1507,Those who are adept with a bow and arrow can keep their hand in on Ibiza and Formentera.,There are numerous tournaments of archery on Ibiza.,1,1,True,"step 1: the premise states that those who are adept with a bow and arrow can 'keep their hand in' on ibiza and formentera. this expression 'keep their hand in' is not commonly used but could be interpreted as meaning that they can practice or use their skills effectively. it suggests a conducive environment for archery.step 2: the hypothesis states that there are 'numerous tournaments of archery' on ibiza. an archery tournament is an event where people come together to practice and showcase their archery skills. the presence of such events would provide opportunities for those adept with a bow and arrow to practice and use their skills.step 3: based on the information identified in step 1 and the logical connection between a conducive environment for archery and the presence of archery tournaments, it can be inferred that the hypothesis is a logical consequence of the premise.step 4: common sense supports the inference as well; having numerous tournaments in a place where the practice of archery is viable makes sense.therefore, the hypothesis can be logically inferred from the premise."
1509,right as a person who had takes unsolicited phones calls and pays money and then all of a sudden you get your thirty a week because now their advertising you right exactly,I get advertised to because I answer calls from random numbers.,1,1,True,"step 1: in the premise, a person receives unsolicited phone calls, pays money, and then gets thirty dollars a week due to advertising. this suggests a causal relationship between answering phone calls from random numbers and receiving advertising. step 2: the hypothesis states that the person gets advertised to because they answer calls from random numbers. this is a logical consequence of the premise, as the premise establishes that answering calls from random numbers leads to receiving advertising. the hypothesis is consistent with the information in the premise. step 3: based on the logical connection between the premise and hypothesis, and the common sense understanding that answering calls from random numbers can lead to receiving advertisements, the hypothesis is a logical entailment of the premise."
1510,than you put into the process so it's a way of of making a profit off the tires,Recycling is the best way to profit off of tires. ,1,1,True,"step 1: in the premise, it is stated that 'than you put into the process' implies an investment or cost. the process being referred to is 'making a profit off the tires'. this suggests that the speaker is discussing the economic aspect of dealing with tires. the hypothesis, 'recycling is the best way to profit off of tires', suggests that recycling is the most effective or efficient method for gaining financial return from tires.step 2: the hypothesis 'recycling is the best way to profit off of tires' can be logically inferred from the premise. the premise implies that an investment is required to make a profit off of tires. recycling is a common method for dealing with used tires, and it can generate revenue through the sale of recycled materials. the fact that recycling is a common and economically viable solution for dealing with tires aligns with the premise's emphasis on profit and investment.step 3: based on the information from the premise and common sense understanding of the context, the hypothesis 'recycling is the best way to profit off of tires' can be reasonably inferred from the premise."
1511,(Don't forget a small tip to the steward who shows you around.),Forget to give the steward a small tip.,0,0,True,"step 1: in the premise, it is mentioned that you should give a small tip to the steward. this suggests an expectation or custom to tip the steward. it does not forcefully imply that you have actually given the tip. step 2: the hypothesis states that you have forgotten to give the small tip. this contradicts the premise as it suggests that you did not follow the recommended action. however, not following a recommendation or expectation does not logically imply an contradiction or a violation of facts. step 3: based on the given information, the hypothesis cannot be logically inferred from the premise, as the premise only suggests an expectation to give a tip, not a guarantee that a tip was given."
1512,What the investment community does like is short-term measures designed to boost share prices.,Long-term measures are liked by the investment community as well.,1,1,True,"step 1: in the premise, it is stated that the investment community responds positively to short-term measures that increase share prices. this implies that the investment community seeks actions that positively impact stock values, whether they are short-term or long-term. step 2: the hypothesis proposes that long-term measures are also liked by the investment community. this is consistent with the information in the premise since long-term measures, if successful, can significantly enhance the overall value of an investment. step 3: based on the logical connection between the premise and hypothesis, the hypothesis can be inferred from the premise. the investment community's preference for measures that increase share prices applies equally to both short-term and long-term measures."
1513,"If reducing federal debt held by the public is not an option, as discussed in text box 4.2, investing in nonfederal financial assets on behalf of the Social Security trust fund could be another way for government saving to provide resources for private investment.",The first option of reducing publicly held federal debt is what most administrations would prefer.,1,0,False,"step 1: in the premise, it is stated that reducing federal debt held by the public is not an option due to certain circumstances, and investing in nonfederal financial assets is mentioned as an alternative for government saving. no information is provided about the preferences of administrations regarding these options.step 2: the hypothesis states that most administrations would prefer reducing publicly held federal debt. however, the premise does not logically entail this. the premise only describes the possibilities but does not indicate any preference or choice made by administrations.step 3: based on the given information, there is no entailment between the premise and the hypothesis."
1514,"And according to the WP TV column, the two talk when they're in the exercise yard together--about old-time flicks they've enjoyed on Turner Classic Movies, which they see via the prison's free cable hook-up.",Guantanamo prisoners have been given the freedom to watch Netflix.,1,0,False,"step 1: in the premise, it is mentioned that guantanamo prisoners have access to turner classic movies through the prison's free cable hook-up. this indicates that they have some form of television or media access. step 2: the hypothesis suggests that guantanamo prisoners have been given the freedom to watch netflix, which is a popular streaming platform. however, the premise does not explicitly state or imply that prisoners have access to netflix. step 3: given the information provided in the premise, the hypothesis cannot be logically inferred. the premise does not contradict the hypothesis, but it does not provide enough evidence to support it. in other words, the premise is not sufficient to entail the hypothesis."
1515,it really rang uh rang a lot of my uh my personal background i i have a a brother myself that's that's older and uh he's not you know nothing nothing of course serious is wrong with him but uh but we have gone through these these lapses of of a relationship somewhat sometimes,My relationship with my brother has never been through any sort of issue.,0,0,True,"step 1: in the premise, the speaker mentions having a brother who is older and describes some lapses in their relationship. this implies that there have been issues in their relationship at certain points. step 2: the hypothesis states that there has never been any sort of issue in the relationship. this contradicts the premise as the speaker has explicitly stated that there have been issues. step 3: based on the logical reasoning, the hypothesis cannot be inferred from the premise as it contradicts the information provided."
1517,"The very remoteness of Tohoku was appealing to such religious groups as the Zen Buddhists, who espouse an ascetic, unworldly life and constructed some of the country's finest Buddhist temples in this northern part of Honshu.",Honshu is where Buddhism is most popular in Japan.,1,1,True,"step 1: the premise describes how the zen buddhists were attracted to the remote and unworldly area of tohoku in honshu for constructing their temples. this indicates that buddhism holds significant importance in this region of japan. step 2: the hypothesis asserts that buddhism is most popular in honshu, which is consistent with the information in the premise as the region where some of the finest buddhist temples were built. additionally, the premise does not provide any contradictory information about the popularity of buddhism in other parts of japan. step 3: given the information in the premise and the lack of contradictory evidence, the hypothesis can be inferred as an accurate statement based on the available information."
1518,"After three days of using the gel, my mouth has returned to its familiar self.",They had just undergone oral surgery. ,1,0,False,"step 1: in the premise, the speaker mentions that after three days of using the gel, their mouth has returned to its familiar self. this implies that there was an unfamiliar state or discomfort in their mouth before using the gel. however, the premise does not provide any specific information about the cause of this discomfort or unfamiliar sensation.step 2: the hypothesis suggests that the cause of the unfamiliar state in the mouth was oral surgery. while there's no direct logical connection between the premise and the hypothesis, oral surgery is a common cause of a mouth's unfamiliar or uncomfortable state. it's a reasonable assumption based on commonsense reasoning and knowledge about oral health.step 3: however, the hypothesis is not logically entailed by the premise because the premise does not provide enough information to definitively conclude that the cause of the unfamiliar mouth sensation was oral surgery. the premise could be explained by other reasons such as food sensitivities, infections, or even the use of certain medications. the hypothesis is not a necessary conclusion based on the information given in the premise.step 4: based on the logical reasoning and the lack of sufficient information in the premise to support the hypothesis, the hypothesis is not entailed by the premise."
1519,A man is playing the guitar while on his right is another man looking at his keyboard.,Two men are sitting close together and one is playing his guitar.,1,1,True,"step 1: in the premise, we have a scenario where one man is playing the guitar and another man is looking at a keyboard. the key information here is that both men are in close proximity to each other. common sense tells us that 'looking at a keyboard' while 'playing the guitar' isn't typical behavior for each man separately. instead, it's more likely that they are involved in a music-related activity together. step 2: the hypothesis perfectly describes the situation in the premise. both men are indeed sitting close together, and one man is playing an instrument (guitar). the hypothesis doesn't add any new information that contradicts the premise, but rather describes the premise in a different way. step 3: based on the logical relationship between the premise and hypothesis, and the common-sense understanding of the situation, the hypothesis is a logical entailment of the premise."
1520,"Other names for these trees are the paperbark tree, the white bottle brush tree.","Other names for these trees are the paperbark tree, punk tree, or the white bottle brush tree.",1,1,True,"step 1: in the premise, the names 'paperbark tree' and 'white bottle brush tree' are provided as alternative names for certain trees. the hypothesis also mentions 'paperbark tree' and 'white bottle brush tree' as alternatives, but it also adds 'punk tree'. step 2: 'punk tree' is a valid alternative name for the paperbark tree in some regions, specifically in australia. this name is not contradictory to the names mentioned in the premise. step 3: based on the logical consistency and common-sense understanding that alternative names for a tree do not exclude each other, the hypothesis can be inferred from the premise."
1521,Issues and challenges for interventions in emergency settings,"There aren't any challenges for interventions, are there?",0,0,True,"step 1: in the premise, 'issues and challenges for interventions in emergency settings' is mentioned. this implies that there are obstacles or difficulties that need to be addressed when implementing interventions in emergency situations. it is a common understanding that emergencies often present complex and unpredictable circumstances.step 2: the hypothesis denies the existence of challenges for interventions, which directly contradicts the information in the premise. if there are no challenges, then there wouldn't be a need for interventions in emergency settings.step 3: based on the logical contradiction between the premise and hypothesis, the hypothesis cannot be inferred from the premise."
1522,We examine. ,We ignored. ,0,0,True,"step 1: the premise 'we examine' is about an action of inspecting or studying something. it suggests an active engagement with the subject matter. step 2: the hypothesis 'we ignored' is about an action of not paying attention or giving no notice to something. these actions are logically opposite to each other. the premise talks about an action of examining, while the hypothesis talks about an action of ignoring. step 3: the hypothesis 'we ignored' cannot be inferred from the premise 'we examine' as they describe contradictory actions."
1523,"He had told Adrin to hold his fire until Jon had fired first, but that would be a hard instinct to fight.",He told Adrin to shoot first.,0,0,True,"step 1: in the premise, we have a situation where a person (he) is giving an instruction to another person (adrin) to wait before firing. this implies a context of potential danger and the importance of coordinated actions. step 2: the hypothesis suggests the opposite of the given instruction in the premise. it introduces the idea that the person told adrin to shoot first instead of waiting. this contradicts the information given in the premise. step 3: based on the given information, the hypothesis cannot be logically inferred from the premise as it presents contradictory information.step 4: it's important to consider the context and potential motivations for such a contradiction. there could be various reasons why someone might give contradictory instructions, such as deception, confusion, or misunderstanding. without further context or additional information, it's impossible to definitively say whether the hypothesis is true or not. however, based on the given information in the premise and hypothesis, the hypothesis does not follow logically."
1524,"Take time to stroll down the streets around Merrion Square, which were laid out at the same time as the square.",The surrounding streets pay homage to the same popular styles as the square.,1,1,True,"step 1: in the premise, the streets surrounding merrion square are described as having been laid out at the same time. this information implies that the architectural styles and planning of these streets would be similar to that of the square, as it is common for urban planning during the same time period to reflect popular architectural trends and styles. step 2: the hypothesis suggests that the surrounding streets pay homage to the same popular styles as the square. this is a logical inference since the premise states that the streets were laid out at the same time and it is reasonable to assume that the popular styles during that period would have been consistent across the square and its surrounding areas. step 3: based on the logical connection between the premise and hypothesis, and the common sense understanding of urban planning during the same time period, the hypothesis can be inferred from the premise."
1525,"Not so uncommon, really, as you would think.",The thing that is not so uncommon is vampires. They are pretty common.,1,0,False,"step 1: the premise is stating that 'not so uncommon, really, as you would think' implies that there is something that is not as rare as people might believe. this statement does not provide enough specific information to infer the identity of this 'thing'. step 2: the hypothesis suggests a completely different concept, namely 'vampires'. there is no logical connection or common sense reasoning to infer that vampires are the 'thing' mentioned in the premise. step 3: based on the given information, the hypothesis cannot be logically inferred from the premise."
1526,"Nasser was to rule for 17 years during which, with Soviet help, Egypt embarked on a huge modernization program.","While disputed, some feel that the Soviets were only there to take Egypt for themselves.",1,0,False,"step 1: in the premise, it is mentioned that egypt underwent a huge modernization program with soviet help during nasser's rule. this implies a close relationship between egypt and the soviet union. step 2: the hypothesis suggests that some people dispute the true intentions of the soviets. this claim does not contradict the information in the premise, as it is possible for there to be differing opinions or interpretations about historical events. step 3: while it may not be logically entailed that the soviets took egypt for themselves based on the given premise, the hypothesis does not contradict it either. it is important to note that the absence of contradiction is not the same as entailment. therefore, the hypothesis cannot be definitively labeled as entailed or not based on the given premise alone."
1527,The others were grouped together at a little distance away.,The others weren't grouped.,0,0,True,"step 1: the premise states that 'the others' were 'grouped together' at a little distance away. this implies that 'the others' were in a close proximity to each other. step 2: the hypothesis states that 'the others weren't grouped.' this directly contradicts the premise as the premise implies that 'the others' were indeed grouped together. step 3: based on the logical negation of the premise, the hypothesis 'the others weren't grouped' cannot be logically inferred from the premise.step 4: it is important to note that the absence of evidence is not evidence of absence. the hypothesis 'the others weren't grouped' may still be true, but it cannot be logically inferred from the premise alone."
1528,What if he strikes first?',What if he runs away and won't fight?,0,0,True,"step 1: in the premise, 'he' is implied to be in a situation that may lead to a fight. the hypothesis presents an alternative scenario where 'he' runs away instead. both sentences express hypothetical situations.step 2: the hypothesis does not contradict the premise. in fact, it's a possible alternative to the scenario presented in the premise. running away as a response to the threat of a fight is a common behavior for humans, and it does not negate the initial premise.step 3: based on the logical reasoning, the hypothesis is not entailed by the premise, but it is still a valid alternative to the premise. the premise and hypothesis are not mutually exclusive."
1529,"99, really necessary?","Without it, there is no entry.",1,0,False,"step 1. in the premise, '99' is mentioned, but its role or relationship to the rest of the sentence is unclear. the sentence does not provide sufficient context to determine its necessity.step 2. the hypothesis states that 'without it, there is no entry'. this could imply several things, but without a clear connection to the premise, it is not logically entailed. there could be various reasons why 'it' is necessary for an entry (it could be a password, a required document, etc.), but the premise does not provide enough information to determine if '99' is the 'it' being referred to in the hypothesis.step 3. based on the given information, it is not possible to logically infer the hypothesis from the premise."
1530,uh no i i don't work for TI so i get cash,"I am a fulltime employee at TI, so I don't get cahs.",0,0,True,"step 1: the premise states that the speaker does not work for texas instruments (ti) and earns cash instead. this implies that the speaker is not a full-time employee of ti and receives payment in a form other than a regular salary.step 2: the hypothesis suggests that the speaker is a full-time employee of ti but does not receive cash. this contradicts the premise, as the speaker is stated to receive cash and not work for ti.step 3: based on the given information, the hypothesis cannot be logically inferred from the premise as they present contradictory statements."
1531,"Thin notes The current system is to mail copies of the announcements to the chairs of relevant science departments, such as chemistry, biology, physics, and computer science.",The announcements are made every month and are widely circulated.,1,0,False,"step 1: in the premise, it is stated that announcements are mailed to chairs of relevant science departments. no information is given about the frequency or extent of the announcements. however, there is no contradictory information that would prevent the hypothesis from being true.step 2: the hypothesis suggests that the announcements are made every month and are widely circulated. this implies that the announcements are a regular occurrence and reach a large audience. given the lack of information in the premise about the frequency or extent of the announcements, the hypothesis does not contradict it. in fact, the hypothesis can be seen as providing additional information that could reasonably follow from the described system of mailing announcements to department chairs.step 3: based on the available information and logical reasoning, there is no contradiction between the premise and the hypothesis. the hypothesis can be seen as providing additional details about the announcements that are consistent with the described system.step 4: logically, the hypothesis cannot be strictly entailed by the premise since the premise does not contain the information about the frequency and circulation of the announcements. however, the hypothesis is not contradictory to the premise and can be seen as a reasonable extension of the information provided in the premise.therefore, the label should be: 0 for no entailment, but the hypothesis is consistent with the premise and provides additional information that can be reasonably inferred from it."
1532,yeah it was yeah it was unimpressive to look at i mean the whole thing was about the size of a a medium house  yeah it wasn't no,We were looking for something bigger than a medium house. ,1,0,False,"step 1: in the premise, the speaker is describing the size of something, which is about the size of a medium house. no specific information is given about what this 'thing' is, and there's no indication that it's a house. step 2: the hypothesis states that the speakers were looking for something bigger than a medium house. this implies that they had a certain size in mind, but the 'thing' described in the premise does not meet that size criteria. step 3: based on the given information, the hypothesis cannot be logically inferred from the premise, as the premise does not provide enough context or specificity to deduce that the 'thing' is a house or that the speakers are looking for a house. therefore, the hypothesis does not follow from the premise."
1533,Here you'll find the last few Jamaican iguanas and yellow snakes.,Jamaican iguanas are on the list of endangered species.,1,1,True,"step 1: in the premise, it is stated that 'here you'll find the last few jamaican iguanas and yellow snakes'. this implies that the populations of these species are rare and declining. the fact that they are 'last few' suggests that they are endangered or at least threatened.step 2: the hypothesis, 'jamaican iguanas are on the list of endangered species', is a logical consequence of the premise. the premise establishes that jamaican iguanas are among the rarest of their kind, and being rare is a defining characteristic of endangered species.step 3: given the information provided, it can be concluded that the hypothesis is entailed by the premise."
1534,"Your mother, you tell me, had a violent quarrel with, some one yesterday afternoon, , ","Your mother got into a fight with the UPS man,",1,1,True,"step 1. the premise describes a violent quarrel between your mother and an unnamed person. the time specified is yesterday afternoon. no other details about the person or the circumstances of the quarrel are provided. common sense suggests that a quarrel can involve a physical altercation or a heated verbal argument. step 2. the hypothesis identifies the ups man as the person your mother had a quarrel with. this is a specific instance of the unnamed person mentioned in the premise. there's no inherent contradiction between the premise and the hypothesis. step 3. based on the information provided, the hypothesis can be logically inferred from the premise since the premise leaves the identity of the person open and the hypothesis provides a specific instance that fits within the given context."
1536,just to go ahead and have the account open because uh,It's your choice if you want to open the account,1,1,True,"step 1: in the premise, the subject 'you' is deciding to open an account due to the existence of the condition 'because'. the hypothesis states that this decision is a 'choice' that 'you' have. step 2: the hypothesis is logically consistent with the premise as 'opening an account' is the action implied by 'having the account open'. the hypothesis adds no new contradictory information. step 3: based on the logical equivalence, the hypothesis can be inferred from the premise."
1537,i think it also probably also more is more as you get into the the big schools the ones that the TVs are going to cover and things anyhow when you still have the the lower sides or the smaller schools they're all doing it just for the for the love of the game because they're not getting the big revenues from anyone,The bigger schools don't get any revenue from anyone.,0,0,True,"step 1: in the premise, the speaker compares smaller schools to bigger schools in the context of sports and revenues. the speaker states that smaller schools do not get 'big revenues from anyone' because they are 'doing it just for the love of the game'. this implies that bigger schools, being the ones 'that the tvs are going to cover and things anyhow', might not have revenues from their own sources but could potentially receive revenues from external sources, like tv broadcasts or sponsorships. however, the premise does not provide enough information to definitively conclude that.step 2: the hypothesis states that 'the bigger schools don't get any revenue from anyone'. this is a stronger claim than what is stated in the premise, as it implies that bigger schools have no revenues at all, not just no revenues from their own sources. the hypothesis contradicts the possibility, suggested in the premise, that bigger schools might have revenues from external sources.step 3: based on the given information, the hypothesis is not logically entailed by the premise. in fact, the hypothesis contradicts the implied meaning of the premise."
1538,"For example, Web sites were used to","For example, books were used to.",0,1,False,"step 1: in the premise, the key information is that 'web sites were used'. this sentence describes a scenario where web sites serve as a tool or medium for some purpose. the hypothesis, 'for example, books were used to', introduces a different tool or medium, books, but it doesn't contradict or change the premise's meaning. both sentences can coexist.step 2: the hypothesis can be logically inferred from the premise since the premise implies that 'for example' can be replaced with any tool or medium. the hypothesis just presents a different example, and it does not alter the original statement.step 3: given the logical consistency and the fact that the hypothesis can be derived from the premise by replacing one tool with another, the hypothesis can be inferred from the premise."
1539,What are you thinking of? said Jane sharply.,What is your next plan? asked Jane impatiently.,1,0,False,"step 1: the premise is a question asked by jane. the tone is sharp, indicating some level of tension or urgency. the question is open-ended, allowing for various possible answers. it does not provide any specific information about the context or the subject of jane's thoughts. step 2: the hypothesis is another question asked by jane, but this time it is phrased as an inquiry about her next plan. the tone is impatient, suggesting that jane is ready for action or decision-making. the hypothesis does not directly contradict the premise, but it does provide additional context about jane's intentions. step 3: while the premise and hypothesis are not identical, they do share a common element: they are both questions asked by jane. this commonality, combined with the lack of contradiction, allows for the hypothesis to be reasonably inferred from the premise. it is possible that jane's next plan is related to her current thoughts, and asking about it is a logical follow-up to the previous question.step 4: however, it is important to note that the hypothesis goes beyond what is explicitly stated in the premise, as it makes an assumption about the content of jane's thoughts being related to a plan. therefore, while the hypothesis can be inferred from the premise with some degree of probability, it does not follow logically and necessarily from it.step 5: based on the logical principles of entailment and common sense reasoning, the hypothesis can be considered a plausible inference from the premise, but not an entailed one."
1540,yeah they just poop and it's yeah they,They don't poop.,0,0,True,"step 1: in the premise, it states that 'they poop'. this is an unambiguous fact. step 2: the hypothesis, 'they don't poop', contradicts the premise as it asserts the opposite. step 3: based on the logical principle that contradictory statements cannot both be true at the same time, the hypothesis cannot be logically inferred from the premise."
1541,"Have you any reason to believe that your mistress was likely to take a sleeping powder last night?""",Did your mistress take upon herself a sleeping drought in your bed last night?,1,1,True,"step 1: both the premise and hypothesis are questioning whether the mistress took a sleeping powder or draught, indicating a similar meaning. the premise is asking if there is any reason to believe she did, while the hypothesis is asking if she indeed did.step 2: the hypothesis is a more explicit and direct restatement of the premise. the words 'upon herself' in the hypothesis are synonymous with 'was likely to take' in the premise. 'took' in the hypothesis is equivalent to 'was likely to take' in the premise. 'sleeping draught' and 'sleeping powder' can also be considered interchangeable terms.step 3: given the similarities and equivalencies between the premise and hypothesis, it can be logically inferred that the hypothesis is entailed by the premise.step 4: based on the logical reasoning and the semantic equivalence, the hypothesis is a restatement of the premise and, thus, is entailed by the premise."
1542,"The ATIRCM/CMWS program did not begin reliability growth testing until 4 years after its critical design review, leaving only 1 year to test the system prior to scheduled production.",ATIRCM/CMWS had all the time in the world to test it's system.,0,0,True,"step 1: in the premise, it is stated that reliability growth testing for the atircm/cmws program began 4 years after its critical design review, leaving only 1 year for testing before scheduled production. this implies that the testing time was limited. step 2: the hypothesis contradicts the premise by suggesting 'all the time in the world' for testing. common sense and logical principles dictate that if the premise states that testing time was limited, it is not logically possible for the hypothesis to be true. step 3: based on the logical reasoning, the hypothesis cannot be inferred from the premise."
1543,"Instead, such interpretations would simply promote the exploitation of vulnerable, low income aliens.",Many low-income aliens do not have a job or steady source of income.,1,1,True,"step 1: in the premise, 'such interpretations' are being criticized for potentially exploiting 'vulnerable, low income aliens'. no specific information about the jobs or income sources of these aliens is provided in the premise. however, the premise implies that they are financially struggling.step 2: the hypothesis states that 'many low-income aliens do not have a job or steady source of income'. this statement is consistent with the information in the premise, as the financial vulnerability of these aliens is a common theme in both sentences.step 3: based on the logical relationship between the premise and hypothesis, the hypothesis can be inferred from the premise as it provides additional detail about the financial situation of the 'vulnerable, low income aliens' mentioned in the premise."
1544,"There was no villainy in his smile, no intimidation.",He could not contain his true intentions.,0,0,True,"step 1: in the premise, it is stated that there was no sign of villainy or intimidation in his smile. this implies that his facial expression was friendly or neutral. step 2: the hypothesis, 'he could not contain his true intentions,' does not logically follow from the premise. the absence of villainy or intimidation in his smile does not necessarily mean that he was hiding or unable to conceal his true intentions. people can have hidden intentions, yet still present a neutral or friendly demeanor. step 3: based on the logical analysis, the hypothesis is not entailed by the premise."
1545,We can infer the value of visibility changes in the other Class I areas by transferring values of visibility changes at Class I areas in the study regions.,We cannot guess the changes in value for visibility changes without adequate guidelines.  ,1,0,False,"step 1: in the premise, it is stated that we can infer the value of visibility changes in other class i areas by transferring values of visibility changes at class i areas in the study regions. this implies that there is a correlation or consistency in visibility change values between different class i areas.step 2: however, the hypothesis states that we cannot guess the changes in value for visibility changes without adequate guidelines. this contradicts the premise, as the premise suggests we can make an inference based on existing values, while the hypothesis suggests that we cannot make any inference without additional information.step 3: based on the logical analysis, the hypothesis cannot be inferred from the premise, as they are in contradiction."
1546,I guess I can finally throw out my Moby Grape albums.,I'm going to keep the albums I have of Moby Grape.,0,0,True,"step 1: in the premise, the speaker expresses their intention to discard their moby grape albums. this statement implies that they no longer have a need or desire to keep these albums. step 2: the hypothesis states that the speaker will keep the albums they have of moby grape. this is the opposite of the premise's statement. step 3: based on the provided information, the hypothesis cannot be logically inferred from the premise."
1547,so no i never do my husband does at work just to get cash out but uh i take the checkbook so i you know i just if i need cash i just tell him and he gets it out and i don't even think i know my number,"If I have to buy something, most times I will just write a check.",1,1,True,"step 1: in the premise, the speaker describes a situation where her husband handles the financial transactions and she only uses the checkbook when she needs cash. this implies that she usually does not handle the financial transactions herself, but relies on her husband to get cash for her. step 2: in the hypothesis, it is stated that 'most times i will just write a check.' this suggests that the speaker engages in writing checks as a method of payment when she needs to make a purchase. given that the speaker mentions having access to the checkbook and relying on her husband for cash, it is a reasonable inference that she uses checks as an alternative to handling cash directly. step 3: based on the information provided in the premise and the logical relationship between the premise and hypothesis, the hypothesis can be inferred from the premise. the hypothesis does not contradict the premise, but rather provides additional detail about the speaker's financial habits.step 4: the speaker's statement in the hypothesis is a statement about her own behavior, which is consistent with the information provided in the premise. thus, the hypothesis can be considered a valid inference from the premise."
1549,There always will be a need for an attorney to do general law.,There will always be a very real need for lawyers and attorney's to practice law.,1,1,True,"step 1: in the premise, it is stated that there will always be a need for an attorney to do general law. this implies that there is a continuous requirement for legal services in various areas. step 2: the hypothesis also asserts that there will always be a need for lawyers and attorneys to practice law. this statement is not contradictory to the premise, as it is an inclusive statement, which implies that the need for lawyers and attorneys falls under the general need for legal services. step 3: based on the logical relationship between the premise and hypothesis, the hypothesis can be inferred from the premise."
1550,A sheep – goat hybrid sometimes called a geep in popular media is the hybrid offspring of a sheep and a goat.,A sheep–goat hybrid (sometimes called a geep or shoat in popular media) is the hybrid offspring of a sheep and a goat.,1,1,True,"step 1: both the premise and hypothesis describe the same concept - a sheep–goat hybrid. the terms 'geep' and 'shoat' are alternative names for this hybrid mentioned in the hypothesis. no contradictory information is presented in the premise.step 2: the hypothesis is logically equivalent to the premise, as they both describe the same concept. therefore, the hypothesis can be inferred from the premise.step 3: based on the logical equivalence of the premise and hypothesis, the hypothesis is entailed by the premise."
1551,A girl jumping rope on a sidewalk near a parking garage.,The girl is outside.,1,1,True,"step 1: in the premise, the girl is performing an action (jumping rope) on a location described as a 'sidewalk near a parking garage'. this information does not contradict or challenge the hypothesis that the girl is outside. in fact, it supports the hypothesis, as the sidewalk is an exterior location.step 2: the hypothesis 'the girl is outside' can be logically inferred from the premise 'a girl jumping rope on a sidewalk near a parking garage'. this is because the location described in the premise (sidewalk) is an exterior location, and the girl's action (jumping rope) is an activity commonly associated with being outside.step 3: based on the logical reasoning and the lack of contradictory information, the hypothesis 'the girl is outside' is entailed by the premise 'a girl jumping rope on a sidewalk near a parking garage'."
1552,These various types of geological formations and activities have created a multitude of environments.,Geological activities have done nothing to create environments.,0,0,True,"step 1: in the premise, 'these various types of geological formations and activities' are identified as the agents responsible for 'creating a multitude of environments'. this implies a causal relationship between the geological phenomena and the resulting environments. step 2: the hypothesis, however, negates this relationship by stating that 'geological activities have done nothing to create environments'. this directly contradicts the information in the premise. step 3: based on this logical analysis, the hypothesis is not entailed by the premise."
1553,we went looking for uh rabbits and we had to go all the way out to Leesburg to find uh a rabbitry a few years back weren't any uh rabbits available in this area except little bunnies available at the uh pet shops and we looked at them and decided they weren't uh too healthy looking,The rabbits were never found.,0,1,False,"step 1: in the premise, the speaker describes their experience of going to look for rabbits and not finding any in their local area except for unhealthy-looking ones at pet shops. step 2: the hypothesis suggests that the rabbits were never found at all. the premise does not directly mention the hypothesis, but the actions described in the premise (going to look for rabbits and not finding any) can be seen as leading to the hypothesis. step 3: based on the logical connection between the premise and hypothesis, and the lack of contradictory information, the hypothesis can be inferred from the premise.step 4: it is important to note that the premise does not definitively prove the hypothesis, but rather provides strong evidence for it. there could be other reasons why the speaker did not find rabbits besides them not being available, such as the season or the location being unsuitable. however, given the information provided, the hypothesis is a logical conclusion."
1554,"Encapuchadores bind these male trees in spring to produce the pale, bleached fronds that are used in Palm Sunday celebrations.",There are celebrations on Palm Sunday to commemorate the resurrection of Jesus Christ.,1,1,True,"step 1: in the premise, we have information about a tradition involving encapuchadores binding male trees during spring to produce pale fronds for palm sunday celebrations. the hypothesis states that there are celebrations on palm sunday to commemorate the resurrection of jesus christ.step 2: while the premise does not directly mention the religious significance of palm sunday, it does establish that there is a tradition connected to this day. the hypothesis, on the other hand, discusses a widely known and accepted reason for the palm sunday celebrations, which is the commemoration of jesus christ's resurrection. this religious significance is not contradictory to the premise and can be seen as an additional layer of meaning to the palm sunday celebrations described.step 3: based on the available information, the hypothesis can be reasonably inferred from the premise because the religious significance of palm sunday is a widely known fact that is not contradicted by the provided premise. the palm sunday tradition described in the premise can be part of the larger context of the religious celebrations mentioned in the hypothesis."
1555,"As warfare became more sophisticated, Jerusalem slowly moved northward and uphill to more defensible ground.",Jerusalem crept slowly southward to make it more defensible.,0,0,True,"step 1: in the premise, we have a historical description of how jerusalem moved to more defensible ground by slowly moving northward and uphill. the reasoning behind this action is the increasing sophistication of warfare, making it necessary for cities to find better defensive positions. this information is factually consistent and there's no contradiction within the premise.step 2: the hypothesis suggests that jerusalem moved southward to make it more defensible. this is a contradiction to the premise since the premise states that jerusalem moved northward and uphill.step 3: based on the information provided, the hypothesis cannot be logically inferred from the premise as it contradicts the key information in the premise."
1556,Wandering the side streets at night allows you to soak up the heady atmosphere of pleasure and commerce that has characterized this part of Osaka for centuries.,Osaka's night life is popular with tourists.,1,1,True,"step 1: the premise describes the night atmosphere in osaka as having a long-standing reputation for pleasure and commerce, implying a vibrant and appealing environment. this description is consistent with the popular perception of tourist destinations. step 2: the hypothesis states that osaka's night life is popular with tourists, which is a direct consequence of the attractive night atmosphere described in the premise. step 3: given the logical connection between the premise and hypothesis, and the consistent interpretation of 'heady atmosphere of pleasure and commerce' as a tourist draw, the hypothesis can be inferred from the premise."
1557,"Pollard may have spied for a friendly country, but he did a traitor's work.",Pollard's information won the friendly country many battles.,1,0,False,"step 1: in the premise, pollard is described as potentially having spied for a friendly country, but his actions are also referred to as 'traitor's work'. this creates a conflict: pollard is portrayed as both helping and harming the friendly country. the key information here is the vague nature of pollard's actions and their ambiguous impact on the friendly country.step 2: the hypothesis suggests that pollard's information led to several battles being won by the friendly country. this is a reasonable inference, as the friendly country benefited from the information. however, it does not directly contradict the premise, as pollard's actions could have both helped and harmed the country in other ways.step 3: while the hypothesis is not directly entailed by the premise, it is still a plausible explanation based on the given information. the ambiguity of pollard's actions leaves room for various interpretations, and the hypothesis represents one possible positive outcome resulting from those actions.step 4: ultimately, the hypothesis cannot be definitively proven or disproven based on the given premise alone. however, it is a possible inference that is consistent with the information provided and does not contradict it."
1558,yeah well i've never been in the situation of itemizing anyhow but uh,Itemizing is often not the most important part. ,1,0,False,"step 1: the premise does not provide sufficient information to make a definitive conclusion about itemizing or its importance. it only states that the speaker has never been in a situation where they had to itemize. step 2: the hypothesis suggests that itemizing is not always the most important part. while this could be true in some contexts, it is not logically entailed by the premise. the premise neither implies nor contradicts the hypothesis. step 3: the lack of a logical connection between the premise and hypothesis means that the hypothesis cannot be inferred from the premise.step 4: it's important to note that the absence of entailment does not necessarily mean the hypothesis is false or incorrect. it simply means that the information in the hypothesis is not logically derived from the premise."
1559,All congressionally requested products will have a targeted issue date that is determined through negotiations between GAO and the requester(s).,Negotiations between the GAO and requesters determine the targeted issue date.,1,1,True,"step 1: in the premise, it is stated that the targeted issue date for all congressionally requested products is determined through negotiations between gao and the requesters. this implies a causal relationship between the negotiations and the determination of the targeted issue date.step 2: the hypothesis simply rephrases the information provided in the premise, stating that negotiations between gao and requesters determine the targeted issue date. this is logically equivalent to the information provided in the premise.step 3: based on the logical equivalence between the premise and hypothesis, the hypothesis can be considered logically entailed by the premise."
1560,Where would he be today without American commercial know-how?,America is the best nation to adjust to changes.,1,0,False,"step 1: in the premise, 'american commercial know-how' is being referred to as a significant factor in someone's success or current situation. this implies that america has provided valuable resources or skills that have contributed to this person's progress. step 2: the hypothesis, 'america is the best nation to adjust to changes', does not directly relate to the premise, as it speaks more broadly about the ability of america as a whole to adapt to changes, instead of focusing on a specific individual's success. however, the premise does not contradict the hypothesis, and there is no explicit reason to assume that they are incompatible. step 3: while the hypothesis cannot be logically inferred from the premise, as they address different aspects, the premise does not provide sufficient evidence to negate the hypothesis either. the hypothesis could be seen as a generalization based on the success story described in the premise, but it would require additional evidence or context to definitively establish a causal relationship between america's ability to adjust to changes and the success mentioned in the premise."
1561,uh it's got an internal three and a half inch floppy,The laptop has a floppy disk drive.,1,1,True,"step 1: in the premise, it is explicitly stated that 'it's got an internal three and a half inch floppy'. this information indicates that the object being described, 'it', has a three and a half inch floppy disk drive located internally. step 2: the hypothesis proposes that the laptop 'has a floppy disk drive'. this is logically equivalent to the statement in the premise. therefore, the hypothesis can be inferred from the premise. step 3: based on the logical equivalence of the two statements, the hypothesis is entailed by the premise."
1562,that's one of the reasons i got out of the business there was too many shenanigans going on,I quit the business because it wasn't profitable enough.,0,0,True,"step 1: the premise suggests that the speaker left a business due to 'too many shenanigans going on'. this implies that there were various problematic situations or behaviors that made the business environment undesirable. no specific mention is made about profitability.step 2: the hypothesis presents an alternative reason for quitting the business, stating that it 'wasn't profitable enough'. although profitability can be a significant concern for business owners, it is distinct from the reasons mentioned in the premise.step 3: based on the given information, the hypothesis 'i quit the business because it wasn't profitable enough' cannot be logically inferred from the premise 'that's one of the reasons i got out of the business there was too many shenanigans going on'. the hypothesis contradicts the information in the premise, as it does not mention profitability as a reason for leaving the business."
1563,"The Guardian had apologized profusely to Patti Boulaye, an actress seeking election as a Conservative to the new Greater London Assembly, for having misquoted her in an interview.",Patti Boulaye was never interviewed by The Guardian.,0,0,True,"step 1: in the premise, it is stated that the guardian had apologized to patti boulaye for misquoting her in an interview. this implies that there was indeed an interview between patti boulaye and the guardian. step 2: the hypothesis, 'patti boulaye was never interviewed by the guardian', directly contradicts the information provided in the premise. a non-apology situation would have been expected if there was no interview to begin with. step 3: based on the logical reasoning and the clear contradiction between the premise and hypothesis, the hypothesis is not entailed by the premise."
1564,Several black children sit at a table with colorful laptops in front of them.,A group of black children with colorful laptops are sitting at a table.,1,1,True,"step 1: in the premise, several black children are sitting at a table with colorful laptops in front of them. this describes a scene where a group of black children are using colorful laptops at a table. there is no contradictory information or logical inconsistency in the premise. step 2: the hypothesis is identical in meaning to the premise, as it states that 'a group of black children with colorful laptops are sitting at a table.' because the hypothesis is logically equivalent to the premise, it can be inferred from the premise. step 3: based on the logical equivalence of the hypothesis and the premise, the hypothesis can be inferred from the premise."
1565,"It was associated with the Hungarian Kingdom within the dual Austro-Hungarian state, being within the Lands of the Crown of St. Stephen or Transleithania.","It was associated with the Hungarian Kingdom within the dual Austro-Hungarian state, being within the Lands of the Crown of St. Stephen or Asterales.",1,0,False,"step 1: both the premise and hypothesis describe the location of an entity within the hungarian kingdom, specifically within the lands of the crown of st. stephen. the difference lies in the last mention of 'asterales' in the hypothesis. however, there is no clear information provided about what 'asterales' refers to. based on the given information, it is not a known or reasonable part of the hungarian kingdom or the lands of the crown of st. stephen.step 2: the hypothesis does not logically follow from the premise because the premise does not provide enough information to infer 'asterales' as a valid part of the hungarian kingdom or the lands of the crown of st. stephen.step 3: based on the logical reasoning and lack of clear information in the hypothesis, the hypothesis cannot be inferred from the premise."
1566,"In these cases, Republicans argue, donors received White House invitations to entice them to give more money.",They wanted to get an invite too.,1,0,False,"step 1: in the premise, it is stated that republicans argue that donors received white house invitations to encourage them to donate more money. this implies a quid pro quo situation where donors receive something of value in return for their contributions. step 2: the hypothesis suggests that 'they' (implied to be people other than the donors) wanted to get an invite too. this does not logically contradict the premise, as it is possible that there are other individuals who also desired an invitation. however, the hypothesis does not follow directly from the premise as it does not specify who 'they' are or why they wanted the invitation. step 3: based on the given information, the hypothesis cannot be definitively determined to be entailed by the premise."
1567,be fostered in as you become you know as you gain new social skills as you become you know more of a functioning member of society and maybe the Air Force Academy is appropriate as you said for someone who you know a more you know who needs to learn self-discipline and so forth would be appropriate for them,The Air Force academy is only appropriate for those who already have a high level of self disciple - anyone else would not stand a chance there. ,0,0,True,"step 1: in the premise, it is stated that the air force academy is appropriate for individuals who are gaining new social skills, learning self-discipline, and becoming more functional members of society. this implies that the academy serves as a place for personal growth and development.step 2: contrarily, the hypothesis states that only those who already have a high level of self-discipline would stand a chance at the air force academy. this directly contradicts the premise, which suggests that the academy is a place for individuals to develop self-discipline and other skills.step 3: based on the contradiction between the premise and hypothesis, it can be concluded that the hypothesis is not entailed by the premise. in fact, the hypothesis goes against the information presented in the premise."
1568,A balding man with a checkered shirt and khaki pants naps on his recliner with his keys on his lap.,A man run in playground.,0,0,True,"step 1: in the premise, we have a description of a man (balding, wearing a checkered shirt and khakis) who is napping on a recliner and holding his keys. this scene is static and does not involve any action related to a playground or running. step 2: the hypothesis introduces a new subject (a man) and a new action (running) that is not present in the premise. running in a playground and napping on a recliner are distinct actions, and there is no logical connection between the two. step 3: based on the provided information, the hypothesis cannot be logically inferred from the premise. it introduces new information that is not entailed by the premise."
1569,"A narrow cobbled trail of 587 steps leads from the town to the small port below, now the domain of a fleet of donkeys that wait to carry cruise ship passengers into town.",The locals charge visitors a small fee to ride on the donkeys.,1,1,True,"step 1: in the premise, we have a description of a trail with 587 steps leading from a town to a port, where donkeys are present and wait to carry cruise ship passengers. this information doesn't necessarily imply that the locals charge visitors a fee to ride the donkeys. however, it is common for locals or businesses to charge fees for services or transportation in tourist areas. step 2: the hypothesis, 'the locals charge visitors a small fee to ride on the donkeys', is consistent with the premise. if the donkeys are there to carry passengers, it's reasonable to assume that a fee is charged for their services. step 3: based on the given information, the logical connection, and common sense reasoning, the hypothesis can be inferred from the premise."
1570,well the floor was uneven you know,the floor was perfectly smooth and flat,0,0,True,"step 1: the premise states that the floor was uneven, indicating that there are variations or inconsistencies in its surface level. this is a departure from a perfectly smooth and flat surface as described in the hypothesis.step 2: the hypothesis contradicts the premise by stating that the floor was perfectly smooth and flat. the presence of surface inconsistencies in the premise makes it not logically entailed in the hypothesis.step 3: based on logical principles and common sense, the hypothesis cannot be inferred from the premise. the premise provides evidence that the floor did not meet the condition specified in the hypothesis."
1571,"AN older woman appears to read from a children's book in an indoor setting, while a seated gentleman in a service uniform looks on.",A young woman stands alone looking in the bathroom mirror.,0,0,True,"step 1: in the premise, we have two main entities - an older woman and a gentleman in a service uniform. they are described as being in an indoor setting and involved in an activity where the older woman is reading from a children's book, and the gentleman is looking on. this scene can be described as a scenario of someone enjoying a leisurely activity with an observer.step 2: the hypothesis describes a completely different scenario involving a young woman looking in the bathroom mirror. there is no connection between the premise and hypothesis based on the provided information. the older woman and the gentleman are in different locations and engaged in different activities.step 3: based on the information provided, there is no logical connection or entailment between the premise and hypothesis. the hypothesis cannot be inferred from the premise."
1572,"Since 1998, LSC has restructured legal services programs in 24 states, and the number of LSC grant recipients has decreased from 269 in 1997, to 167 anticipated grantees (Basic Field and Native American grants) in calendar year 2002.",LSC has seen less need of it's programs since 1997.,1,1,True,"step 1: the premise states that lsc (legal services corporation) has restructured legal services programs in 24 states since 1998 and the number of grant recipients has decreased from 269 to 167. this decrease suggests a reduction in the demand for lsc's programs or services.step 2: the hypothesis 'lsc has seen less need of it's programs since 1997' logically follows from the premise, as the premise indicates a decrease in the number of grant recipients, which is a measure of demand for lsc's programs. this decrease can be attributed to less need, as one possible explanation.step 3: based on the logical connection between the premise and hypothesis, and the lack of contradictory information, the hypothesis can be inferred from the premise."
1573,"At Saint-Joseph ask to be shown a traveler's tree (arbre du voyageur) from Madagascar, which has a reserve supply of water within its trunk.",The traveler's tree came from Madagascar but is planted all over now.,1,1,True,"step 1: in the premise, it is mentioned that a traveler's tree is asked for at saint-joseph and described as a tree from madagascar with a reserve supply of water within its trunk. this information defines the origin and a specific property of the traveler's tree. step 2: the hypothesis suggests that the traveler's tree came from madagascar but is now planted everywhere. while the origin remains the same, the second part of the hypothesis introduces a new piece of information: the tree is now widespread. step 3: given that the premise and hypothesis agree on the origin of the traveler's tree, the hypothesis can be considered a generalization of the premise, where the new information about the tree's current distribution does not contradict the original premise. thus, the hypothesis can be inferred from the premise as long as we consider the generalization as an acceptable extension of the given information.step 4: it is essential to consider whether the generalization is reasonable and supported by the premise or common knowledge. since the traveler's tree is named after its origin, it is reasonable to assume that it once was a rare tree only found in madagascar. however, its current distribution being wider does not contradict the original premise, and it is a common occurrence for valuable or significant trees to spread and be cultivated in various places over time. therefore, the hypothesis is a reasonable extension of the premise.step 5: based on the logical reasoning, the lack of contradiction between the premise and hypothesis, and the common sense understanding that the tree's distribution may have expanded over time, the hypothesis can be inferred from the premise."
1574,Chief Judge Robert M. Bell said his budget request is intended to maintain the same level of services that we have had in the last several years in terms of access to justice for the needy.,"The budget request by Chief Judge Robert M. Bell is intended to maintain the same level, because the level is working perfectly. ",1,1,True,"step 1: in the premise, chief judge bell states that his budget request is intended to maintain the same level of services in terms of access to justice for the needy, which implies that the current level of services is considered satisfactory or adequate. step 2: the hypothesis suggests that the budget request is maintained at the same level because 'it is working perfectly'. while the premise does not directly state that the current level of services is perfect, it does imply that the level of services is considered satisfactory. the hypothesis is not a logical contradiction of the premise, as both statements refer to maintaining the same level of services. step 3: the hypothesis can be seen as a restatement or elaboration of the premise, as it emphasizes the reason for maintaining the same level of services. therefore, the hypothesis can be inferred from the premise, as it does not contradict it and provides additional information that is logically consistent."
1575,Many dishes originated in the kitchens of the Ottoman sultans in the time of S??leyman the Magnificent there were more than 150 recipes for aubergines alone.,They made delicious and healthy food in those kitchens. ,1,0,False,"step 1: the premise states that there were many dishes originated in the ottoman sultans' kitchens during the time of suleyman the magnificant, and there were over 150 recipes for aubergines alone. this implies a rich culinary tradition. step 2: the hypothesis is not directly related to the information provided in the premise, but it is a reasonable inference based on common sense and the context. delicious and healthy food is a typical expectation from a rich culinary tradition. step 3: the hypothesis can be inferred from the premise because the existence of a large number of recipes suggests a high level of culinary expertise, which is likely to result in delicious and healthy dishes. however, the hypothesis is not logically entailed by the premise as the premise does not explicitly state that the dishes were delicious and healthy, but it is a reasonable assumption based on common sense and the context."
1576,Participants expressed the belief that having the right people on the board is just as important if not more so as having the right rules under which the board operates.,The participants also expressed that they do not like the color red.,1,0,False,"step 1: in the premise, participants' beliefs about the importance of having the right people and rules are expressed. no information is given about their preferences regarding colors. step 2: the hypothesis expresses a different concept, having nothing to do with the beliefs or actions of the participants regarding the board. step 3: as there is no logical connection or implication between the premise and hypothesis, the hypothesis cannot be inferred from the premise.step 4 (bonus): it's important to note that the hypothesis is not related to the premise in any way and the premise does not provide enough information to infer the hypothesis. therefore, the label should be 0."
1577,"With a sudden fear clutching at her heart, Tuppence ran to the bed.",Tuppence calmly walked to the bed. ,0,0,True,"step 1: the premise describes tuppence as having a sudden fear, which is a strong emotional response leading to quick and often panic-stricken actions. running to the bed is a common response to fear. no contradictory facts are given in the premise.step 2: the hypothesis, however, suggests a completely different emotional state and action - calmly walking. this contradicts the emotional state described in the premise.step 3: the hypothesis cannot be logically inferred from the premise as it contradicts the emotional state described in the premise."
1578,Don't miss Titian's own monumental tomb (in the right aisle); he died in 1576 during a local plague.,Titian lived through the plague and died in 1586.,0,0,True,"step 1: in the premise, it is stated that titian died during a local plague in 1576. this information is factual and provides a crucial piece of context about the artist's life. step 2: the hypothesis, however, contradicts the premise by stating that titian lived through the plague and died in a later year, 1586. this directly contradicts the known fact stated in the premise. step 3: based on the contradiction between the premise and hypothesis, the hypothesis cannot be logically inferred from the premise."
1579,we couldn't call in they said it would be up Friday the March the fifteenth before it was prepared so i missed several days because i was getting quite a few calls,It will be ready well before March 15th.  ,0,0,True,"step 1: in the premise, it is stated that the call-in couldn't be made before march 15th because it wasn't prepared yet. this implies that the preparation process takes some time, and missing several days indicates that the process is ongoing.step 2: the hypothesis suggests that the call-in will be ready 'well before' march 15th. this implies a significant difference in timing from the premise.step 3: given the information from the premise, it is not logically possible to infer that the call-in will be ready 'well before' march 15th. the premise explicitly states that the call-in won't be ready by march 15th, and the hypothesis contradicts this.step 4: therefore, based on the logical inconsistency between the premise and hypothesis, the hypothesis cannot be logically inferred from the premise."
1580,"And so you have SLATE 's suggested revenue-enhancement for today, and as for tomorrow, see above--and let your imagination run wild.",The revenue was top secret.,0,0,True,"step 1. the premise describes slate's suggested revenue-enhancement for today, but it does not provide any information about the nature or amount of the revenue. it also mentions that there is no suggested revenue strategy for tomorrow. the hypothesis, 'the revenue was top secret,' is not explicitly stated in the premise and makes a claim about the confidentiality of the revenue.step 2. the hypothesis cannot be logically inferred from the premise as it lacks the necessary context and information to make such an inference. the premise does not provide any details about the revenue or suggest that it was kept secret.step 3. based on the information given in the premise and the logical principles, the hypothesis 'the revenue was top secret' cannot be inferred from the premise."
1582,"This ancient ritual is meant to pave the way for a good harvest, with branches of hollyhock to stave off thunder and earthquakes.",The ancient ritual is done to ensure the reproduction of the people.,0,0,True,"step 1: in the premise, we have information about an ancient ritual and its purpose. the ritual involves using branches of hollyhock to pave the way for a good harvest and to stave off thunder and earthquakes. step 2: the hypothesis suggests a different purpose for the ancient ritual - to ensure the reproduction of the people. however, there is no direct logical connection or indication in the premise that the ritual is related to human reproduction. step 3: based on the information provided, the hypothesis cannot be logically inferred from the premise."
1583,and we have one of course i say in college driving and and one going to drive this summer so uh kids are cost you practically nothing because you always get so many things from your relatives and everything but you wait until they go and get a car insurance and you and that's when they get expensive as they get older you know uh it it,"Kids are expensive when they get older, but it's still not that bad.",1,1,True,"step 1: in the premise, the speaker mentions that kids are relatively inexpensive during their college years due to various sources of financial support. however, they note that the cost increases significantly once the kids get a car and need insurance. this implies that the cost of raising kids becomes more substantial as they get older. the speaker's observation is factually consistent and logically connected.step 2: the hypothesis states that kids are expensive when they get older but adds an additional qualifier 'but it's still not that bad.' this does not contradict the premise as the premise does not specify the exact amount or extent of the cost increase. however, the hypothesis does add an element of subjectivity, as 'not that bad' is a relative term.step 3: while the hypothesis does not directly follow from the premise due to the added qualifier, it is still logically related. the premise establishes that the cost of raising kids increases as they get older, and the hypothesis acknowledges that fact but offers a more positive assessment of the situation. thus, the hypothesis can be seen as a reasonable interpretation or extension of the premise.step 4: ultimately, the hypothesis can be considered a valid inference based on the information in the premise, even with the added qualifier."
1584,and uh there wasn't a thing they could do you know they'd take her down to the juvenile hall and then they'd have to let her go and she'd be back  doing it,They would have to let her go from juvenile hall and then she would go right back to doing it because her parents don't care.,1,1,True,"step 1: in the premise, it is mentioned that they would take her to juvenile hall and have to let her go because there was no other option. this indicates a cycle of her being taken to juvenile hall and then released back into the same environment where she continues to engage in problematic behavior. step 2: the hypothesis suggests that her parents don't care, which, given the context of the premise, could explain why she is able to keep engaging in the problematic behavior and being released back into the same environment. step 3: based on the logical connection between the premise and hypothesis and the common sense understanding that a lack of parental intervention could allow for a continuation of problematic behavior, the hypothesis can be inferred from the premise.step 4: it is important to note that while the hypothesis can be inferred from the premise, it does not mean that the premise implies that the parents' lack of care is the only possible reason for her continued problematic behavior. other factors could also contribute to this cycle, and the premise does not rule out the possibility of additional contributing factors.therefore, the hypothesis is a reasonable inference from the premise, but it may not be the only explanation."
1585,"Second, the Slate 60 list does not attempt to weigh the merits of different charities.",The merits of each charity are clearly defined in the list.,0,0,True,"step 1: in the premise, it is stated that the slate 60 list does not consider the merits of different charities. this implies that the list does not provide any evaluation or ranking of charities based on their effectiveness or impact. step 2: the hypothesis suggests that the merits of each charity are clearly defined in the list. however, the premise does not support this conclusion. the absence of merit evaluation in the list does not necessarily mean that the merits of each charity are clearly defined. in fact, it is more likely that the merits are not defined since the premise explicitly states that this information is not provided. step 3: based on the given information, the hypothesis cannot be logically inferred from the premise."
1586,"Oh, come now!",That is not possible!,1,0,False,"step 1: both the premise and hypothesis are declarative statements expressing disbelief or doubt about a situation. the premise contains an exclamation, which may suggest strong emotion or emphasis. the hypothesis is a negative statement that denies the possibility of something. step 2: 'that is not possible' cannot be logically inferred from 'oh, come now!' because the premise does not contain enough information to entail the hypothesis. the hypothesis goes beyond the given premise by making a stronger negative claim. step 3: based on the logical analysis, the hypothesis is not entailed by the premise."
1587,uh-huh oh yeah well see you're probably about the same age as me because my mom watched The Secret Storm and The Edge of Night um-hum uh-huh uh-huh,We probably watched the same shows growing up since we are about the same age.,1,1,True,"step 1: in the premise, the speaker mentions that they and the person being addressed are probably the same age because their mothers watched the secret storm and the edge of night. this implies that the speaker is assuming a correlation between their age and the shows their mothers watched. common sense suggests that people who grew up during the same time period are more likely to have watched the same shows. step 2: the hypothesis makes the same assumption about shared age and shared media consumption. it proposes that, based on the age assumption in the premise, the speaker and the addressed person likely watched the same shows growing up. this is a logical inference from the premise as both the premise and hypothesis rely on the common assumption that age and media consumption during that age are related. step 3: the hypothesis is entailed by the premise as the premise implies a shared age and the hypothesis proposes a shared media consumption based on that assumption."
1588,Ski equipment sits alone on a snowy mountain,Some skis are sitting in the snow.,1,1,True,"step 1: in the premise, 'ski equipment' is identified as being present on a snowy mountain. 'ski equipment' is a general term that includes skis. therefore, the key information is that skis are among the objects present on the mountain.step 2: the hypothesis states that 'some skis' are in the snow. this is a specific instance of the more general information given in the premise. therefore, the hypothesis can be logically inferred from the premise.step 3: based on the logical relationship between the premise and hypothesis, and the fact that there is no contradictory information, the hypothesis can be inferred from the premise."
1589,"Inside stands a formidable Flamboyant Gothic pulpit, built for the preacher Geiler von Kaysersberg to match his fulminations against the Protestant Reformation.",The pulpit is too extravagant and was costly to make. ,1,1,True,"step 1: the premise describes the flamboyant gothic pulpit as 'formidable' and built for geiler von kaysersberg to match his fiery sermons against the protestant reformation. this implies a grand and ornate design. no contradictory facts are presented.step 2: the hypothesis suggests that the pulpit is 'too extravagant' and 'costly' to make. this inference can be derived from the premise because a formidable, ornate pulpit, as described, would naturally be more costly and extravagant than a simpler design.step 3: based on the logical connection between the premise and hypothesis, and the lack of contradictory facts, the hypothesis can be inferred from the premise."
1590,Some have been given new back - stories not evident in previous versions of the legend.,Some have been given new back-stories or characteristics not evident in previous versions of the legend.,1,1,True,"step 1: the premise indicates that there are some elements in the legend that have been altered or expanded upon, and these changes are not immediately apparent in previous versions. this could include new back-stories or characteristics. step 2: the hypothesis directly relates to the premise by stating that some elements (back-stories or characteristics) have been given new forms that were not present in previous versions. step 3: the hypothesis is a logical consequence of the premise. in fact, the premise sets up the condition for the hypothesis to be true. step 4: there are no contradictory facts or logical principles that would prevent the hypothesis from being inferred from the premise. therefore, based on the logical reasoning, the hypothesis is entailed by the premise."
1591,The Wine Market Council will launch a media campaign in February.,The marketing for the council will come in March.,0,0,True,"step 1: in the premise, it is stated that the wine market council will launch a media campaign in february. this means that an advertising or promotional effort will be initiated by the council during that month. step 2: the hypothesis suggests that marketing for the council will occur in march. this is different from the stated fact in the premise. step 3: however, the hypothesis does not contradict the premise. it is possible that the media campaign mentioned in the premise extends into march or that there is a separate marketing effort planned for that month. without further context or information, it is not possible to definitively say that the hypothesis is entailed by the premise or not. step 4: based on the given information, the hypothesis cannot be logically inferred from the premise with certainty."
1592,The merchandise processing fee is associated with the cost of the Customs Service's operations.,The merchandise processing fee is usually very expensive,1,0,False,"step 1: in the premise, it is stated that the merchandise processing fee is associated with the cost of the customs service's operations. this means that the fee is a part of the overall cost incurred by the customs service in processing merchandise. no information is given regarding the actual cost or price of the fee.step 2: the hypothesis states that the merchandise processing fee is usually very expensive. this is not a direct deduction from the premise, as the premise does not provide any information about the cost or price of the fee.step 3: based on the given information, it cannot be logically inferred that the hypothesis is entailed by the premise. the premise only establishes a cost association between the merchandise processing fee and the customs service's operations, while the hypothesis makes a statement about the cost level of the fee."
1593,"Gentler footpaths radiate from it on to the vast commons of Brampton and Martindale, but the main part of this route is not for the inexperienced or the unfit.",All footpaths are gentle and can be traversed by the inexperienced or the unfit.,0,0,True,"step 1: in the premise, 'gentler footpaths' are mentioned as radiating from the main part of a route. this implies that not all footpaths in this area are gentle. additionally, the statement 'but the main part of this route is not for the inexperienced or the unfit' suggests that some parts of the route are challenging. step 2: the hypothesis asserts that 'all footpaths are gentle and can be traversed by the inexperienced or the unfit'. this contradicts the information in the premise that some footpaths are not gentle and not suitable for the inexperienced or unfit. step 3: based on the logical negation of the hypothesis in relation to the premise, the hypothesis cannot be logically inferred from the premise."
1594,"Most Falwell-style Christians would probably say yes, since the Antichrist is a false Messiah, he'll have to be Jewish, like Christ himself.",Falwall would say no to that question.,0,0,True,"step 1: in the premise, it is stated that 'most falwell-style christians would probably say yes' to the idea that the antichrist would be jewish, based on the belief that the antichrist is a false messiah and that jesus was himself jewish. this suggests a common belief among falwell-style christians that the antichrist will be jewish. step 2: however, the hypothesis states that 'falwall would say no' to the question of whether the antichrist would be jewish. this contradicts the general belief stated in the premise. step 3: based on the given information, falwell's personal belief cannot be logically inferred from the statement about the beliefs of 'most falwell-style christians'. the hypothesis is not entailed by the premise, as falwell's personal beliefs may differ from the collective beliefs of the group."
1596,Final Report for the US Environmental Protection Agency.,The final report includes a picture of a small child holding a balloon.,1,0,False,"step 1. the premise is a statement about a final report for the us environmental protection agency. it does not provide any specific information about the contents of the report, including the presence or absence of images or descriptions of people or objects. step 2. the hypothesis is a statement about a specific image of a small child holding a balloon, which is not mentioned or implied in the premise. step 3. based on the information provided, it is not logically possible to determine whether the hypothesis is entailed by the premise or not, as the premise does not provide enough detail to make such a determination."
1597,"Where?"" Sir James smiled.","""When?"" Sir James frowned.",0,0,True,"step 1: the premise 'where?' indicates sir james expressing a question about a location. it does not provide any specific information about sir james or his context. the hypothesis 'when?' represents a different type of question, asking about time. step 2: the hypothesis 'when?' cannot be logically inferred from the premise 'where?' as they address different aspects of the situation. there is no common sense reasoning or factual consistency that would allow us to infer one question type from the other based on the given information. step 3: based on the logical analysis, the hypothesis 'when?' is not entailed by the premise 'where?'."
1598,"The team plays its home games at the CN Centre, formally known as the Prince George Multiplex.","The team is based in Prince George, British Columbia, and plays its home games at the CN Centre, formally known as the Prince George Multiplex.",1,1,True,"step 1: in the premise, it is stated that the team plays its home games at the cn centre, which is formally known as the prince george multiplex. this implies that the team is located in prince george, british columbia, as the cn centre is the primary sports and entertainment facility in prince george.step 2: the hypothesis repeats the information in the premise about the team playing its home games at the cn centre in prince george, with an additional statement that the team is based in prince george. this statement is logically entailed by the information in the premise, as the team cannot play its home games at a location if it is not based there.step 3: based on the logical relationship between the premise and hypothesis, the hypothesis can be inferred from the premise."
1599,And the editor heard Jacob's plea.,Jacob's second plea was heard by the editor.,1,1,True,"step 1: the premise states that the editor heard jacob's plea. this means that jacob made an appeal or request to the editor, and the editor acknowledged it. step 2: the hypothesis suggests that jacob made another plea, and this plea was also heard by the editor. given that there is no indication in the premise that jacob made only one plea, and the hypothesis does not contradict any information in the premise, it is reasonable to infer that this second plea also occurred and was heard by the editor. step 3: based on the logical reasoning, lack of contradiction, and given that the premise leaves open the possibility that there were multiple pleas, the hypothesis can be inferred from the premise."
1600,but if you you have a family i think you owe the family a responsibility,If you have a family you owe them a responsability. Specially to your big brother.,1,1,True,"step 1: in the premise, the speaker expresses the belief that having a family entails a responsibility towards the family. the speaker uses the phrase 'i think' to indicate that this is a subjective belief, but the meaning is clear. the phrase 'specially to your big brother' suggests that there may be additional familial responsibilities beyond the general one.step 2: the hypothesis is essentially the same as the premise, with the minor difference that it specifically focuses on the responsibility towards the family, without mentioning the speaker's perspective. this difference is not significant enough to change the logical relationship between the two statements.step 3: based on the similarity between the premise and hypothesis, and the lack of contradictory information, the hypothesis can be considered logically entailed by the premise. the hypothesis is a more general statement that can be inferred from the specific scenario described in the premise.therefore,"
1601,First he said House Republicans shouldn't balance their budget on the backs of the poor.,The budget process currently favors House Republicans and their proposals.,1,0,False,"step 1: in the premise, the speaker expresses an opinion that house republicans should not balance their budget at the expense of the poor. this statement does not necessarily imply that the current budget process unfairly favors house republicans or their proposals. however, it does suggest a potential conflict of interest or discrepancy between the desired budget outcome (not harming the poor) and the current reality.step 2: the hypothesis states that the budget process currently favors house republicans. this statement is not logically entailed by the premise, as the premise only expresses an opinion about the desired outcome of the budget process, not the current state of the process.step 3: based on the given information, there is no clear logical relationship between the premise and the hypothesis. the premise expresses an opinion about a desired budget outcome, while the hypothesis asserts a fact about the current state of the budget process. without further context or information, it is not possible to definitively say that one can be inferred from the other."
1602,We are going through my mother's papers. ,The papers needed sorting.,1,1,True,"step 1: the premise describes an ongoing action, 'going through my mother's papers'. sorting papers is a common and necessary process when dealing with a large collection of documents. this is based on logical principles and common sense.step 2: the hypothesis, 'the papers needed sorting', can be inferred from the premise as it is a reasonable assumption given the nature of the task described in the premise. the action of sorting is a response to having a large collection of papers that need to be managed.step 3: based on the logical reasoning and common sense, the hypothesis can be inferred from the premise."
1603,"Poirot, I said, ""what was in this particular little bottle?"" Poirot looked out of the window. ",Poirot looked out the window because he was trying to figure out a good lie.,1,0,False,"step 1: the premise describes poirot asking a question about a little bottle and looking out of the window in response. this action does not inherently suggest that poirot was trying to figure out a lie. the context provided does not indicate any deception or dishonesty. step 2: the hypothesis, 'poirot looked out the window because he was trying to figure out a good lie', contradicts the given premise, as there is no evidence in the premise that supports the idea that poirot was trying to deceive anyone. step 3: based on the logical analysis, the hypothesis is not entailed by the premise."
1604,Program managers need operational and financial data to monitor whether they are meeting their agencies' strategic and annual performance plans and meeting their goals for accountability and effective use of resources.,Program managers need data to monitor if they are meeting their goals for being more productive than the competitor.,1,1,True,"step 1: in the premise, it is stated that program managers need data to monitor their performance and meet goals for accountability and effective use of resources. this implies that the data is essential for tracking progress towards achieving targets set by their agencies. step 2: the hypothesis suggests that program managers need data to monitor their productivity relative to a competitor. while not explicitly stated in the premise, this requirement for data is closely related to the need for data to monitor performance and meet goals as mentioned in the premise. in the context of managing programs, productivity is an important aspect of performance. step 3: based on the logical connection between the need for data to monitor productivity and the need for data to monitor performance and meet goals, the hypothesis can be inferred from the premise.step 4: additionally, it is common sense that in order to improve productivity and stay competitive, program managers would need to regularly assess and compare their performance to that of their competitors. this further reinforces the inference that the hypothesis can be logically inferred from the premise.therefore, the hypothesis is a logical extension of the information provided in the premise."
1605,It is home to Hong Kong's first racetrack.,Hong Kong's first horse race track.,1,1,True,"step 1: the premise states that hong kong's first racetrack is located there. the term 'racetrack' implies a facility used for horse racing. there are no contradictory facts or logical inconsistencies in the premise.step 2: the hypothesis 'hong kong's first horse race track' can be logically inferred from the premise because a horse race track and a racetrack are synonymous in this context. since the premise states that it is the first racetrack in hong kong, it follows that it is the first horse race track.step 3: based on the logical reasoning, there is no contradiction or discrepancy between the premise and hypothesis, and the hypothesis can be inferred from the premise."
1606,A woman in a black coat is riding her bike on a street as a man in shorts and a striped top looks at her as he passes her.,A man is checking out a woman as she rides by on her red bike.,1,1,True,"step 1: in the premise, we have two individuals identified by their descriptions - a woman in a black coat riding a bike and a man in shorts and a striped top. the man is looking at the woman as he passes her. this scenario is consistent with the hypothesis where a man is checking out a woman. the actions and descriptions of the individuals in the premise do not contradict the hypothesis.step 2: the hypothesis can be logically inferred from the premise as the action of 'checking out' is a type of looking or observing. the man's action of looking at the woman as he passes her is consistent with the hypothesis of checking her out.step 3: based on the logical reasoning and the lack of contradictory information, the hypothesis can be inferred from the premise."
1607,"Just down the road from the museum lie the rolling fairways of Martinique's 18-hole golf course, and a little farther on, the Pointe-du-Bout resort with its cluster of hotels, beaches, and a marina.","The tourists seem to all flock to the 18-hole golf course, the locals not so much.",1,1,True,"step 1: in the premise, we have information about the proximity of the golf course and the pointe-du-bout resort to the museum, and that both attract different groups of people - tourists and locals. no logical connections or contradictions are present in the premise.step 2: the hypothesis describes the tourists' preference for the golf course over other attractions in the area, while the locals' behavior is not explicitly mentioned. however, since there's no contradictory information in the premise, and the hypothesis doesn't change the facts stated in the premise, it can still be considered.step 3: given the information from the premise, the hypothesis can be reasonably inferred. the presence of tourists and their attractions (golf course) at the location implies that they might be more interested in that particular attraction than other locals. this is a common observation, as tourists often seek out unique experiences that locals might not prioritize or frequent regularly.step 4: based on the logical reasoning, lack of contradictory information, and common sense, the hypothesis is entailed by the premise."
1608,"Although many excellent studies and books have been written on national saving and long-term economic growth, these discussions tend to be complex and technical.",Many excellent studies and books were written by Roald Dahl,1,0,False,"step 1: the premise discusses the complexity and technical nature of studies and books related to national saving and long-term economic growth. it does not provide any specific information about the authors of these works. step 2: the hypothesis makes a claim about the authors of 'many excellent studies and books,' suggesting a different meaning compared to the premise. roald dahl is a renowned author of children's stories, novels, and essays, not an expert in national saving and long-term economic growth. the hypothesis is not logically related to or can be inferred from the premise. step 3: based on the logical analysis, the hypothesis is not entailed by the premise."
1609,yeah well i haven't get a chance i haven't got a chance to look at them yet,I looked at them already and I liked them.,0,0,True,"step 1: in the premise, the speaker is expressing that they have not had a chance to look at something. this statement implies a lack of prior engagement or examination of the items in question.step 2: the hypothesis states that the speaker has already looked at the items and liked them. this statement suggests a direct contradiction to the premise, as the speaker in the hypothesis is asserting they have already engaged with the items and had a positive reaction.step 3: given the contradictory nature of the hypothesis and the premise, it cannot be logically inferred from the premise that the speaker has already looked at and liked the items.step 4: in natural language, people often make statements that are not literally true but convey certain implied meanings or nuances. however, in this case, the hypothesis contradicts the premise too directly to be a reasonable inference, and it does not align with the logical or common-sense understanding of the premise.the hypothesis 'i looked at them already and i liked them' is not entailed by the premise 'yeah well i haven't gotten a chance i haven't got a chance to look at them yet'."
1610, Maybe she would like the Pentagon.,She would probably like the Pentagon.,1,1,True,"step 1: in the premise, it is suggested that there is a possibility that the subject 'she' has a liking for the pentagon. step 2: the hypothesis states that the subject 'she' would probably like the pentagon, which is a stronger statement than the premise's 'maybe'. however, the hypothesis can be logically inferred from the premise because 'probably' implies a high degree of possibility, which is already present in the premise. step 3: based on the logical reasoning, the hypothesis can be inferred from the premise."
1611,yeah i just kind of sew for my kids and that's about it,I sew for my job. ,0,0,True,"step 1: the premise states that the speaker 'just kind of sews for [their] kids.' this suggests a hobby or personal activity. common sense and logical understanding do not directly support the hypothesis that the speaker 'sews for [their] job.' step 2: the hypothesis contradicts the premise, as sewing for a job implies a professional or business context, while sewing for kids indicates a personal one. step 3: based on the contradiction between the premise and hypothesis, and the lack of logical or factual connections between them, the hypothesis cannot be inferred from the premise."
1612,"He knew the names of each of these single shot  A silver-flanged fleur-de-lis, he said, or something like that.",He knew what to call the flower icons.,1,1,True,"step 1: in the premise, 'he knew the names of each of these single shot a silver-flanged fleur-de-lis,' the speaker is identified as knowing the names of certain objects. the objects are described as 'single shot a silver-flanged fleur-de-lis.' 'fleur-de-lis' is a type of ornamental decoration in the form of a stylized lily. it is common knowledge and a logical assumption that 'flower icons' or 'icons depicting fleur-de-lis' are referred to as 'fleur-de-lis' in everyday language and technical terminology.step 2: the hypothesis, 'he knew what to call the flower icons,' is an alternative way of expressing the same idea as the premise. it is logically equivalent to the premise since 'knowing what to call' implies 'knowing the name.'step 3: based on the logical equivalence between the premise and the hypothesis, and the lack of contradictory information, the hypothesis can be inferred from the premise."
1613,and i it was just miserable i hated that place,It was poorly built together and inconvenient. ,1,0,False,"step 1: the premise expresses a strong emotional dislike for a place. it does not provide any concrete information about the physical condition of the place. step 2: the hypothesis suggests that the place was poorly built and inconvenient. this is a possible explanation for why someone might hate a place, but it is not the only possible explanation. other reasons could include the place being dirty, crowded, noisy, or associated with negative memories. step 3: the hypothesis can be seen as a possible inference from the premise, but it is not logically entailed. the premise does not provide enough information to definitively conclude that the place was poorly built or inconvenient. the hypothesis adds additional information that is not explicitly stated in the premise, but it is a reasonable assumption based on common experience. step 4: in conclusion, the hypothesis is not logically entailed by the premise, but it is a reasonable inference based on common sense and the available information."
1614,uh-huh what type of camping did you do,You don't camp at all do you?,0,0,True,"step 1: the premise is a question asking about the type of camping someone did. it does not contain any explicit information about the person's camping habits or lack thereof. the hypothesis, on the other hand, is a statement that the person does not camp at all. step 2: to logically infer the hypothesis from the premise, there would need to be evidence or implication in the premise that camping does not occur. however, the premise poses a question, which is an open-ended request for information, not a statement or implication. therefore, the hypothesis cannot be logically inferred from the premise. step 3: based on the information given, there is no entailment between the premise and hypothesis."
1615,Their capital in Khorasan was initially located at Merv but was later moved to Nishapur.,Their capital in Khorasan was initially located at Sartre but was later moved to Nishapur.,0,0,True,"step 1. the premise states that the capital of a certain region, khorasan, was first located at merv and later moved to nishapur. this provides historical context and a specific sequence of events. step 2. the hypothesis suggests a different initial location for the capital, sartre, instead of merv. this is a contradiction to the premise. step 3. based on the provided information, the hypothesis is not logically entailed by the premise as it introduces a new and contradictory piece of information."
1616,"Leonardo da Vinci spent his last days in a small manor house nearby, the Clos-Luc??, now a museum illustrating his talents.",Many of Leonardo da Vinci's works are exhibited at the manor house.,1,1,True,"step 1. in the premise, it is mentioned that the clos-luc?? manor house is now a museum illustrating leonardo da vinci's talents. this implies that the manor house is a place dedicated to showcasing leonardo da vinci's works. step 2. the hypothesis proposes that many of leonardo da vinci's works are exhibited at the manor house. this hypothesis is directly related to the information provided in the premise and can be logically inferred from it. step 3. based on the logical connection between the premise and hypothesis, and the common-sense understanding that a museum is a place where one can find works of an artist, the hypothesis can be inferred from the premise."
1617,An old ban with a black hat and tie walks down a city street.,The cat is walking.,0,0,True,"step 1: in the premise, an old man is described as walking down a city street, wearing a black hat and tie. this information does not provide any indication of an animal or a cat being present. common sense and factual knowledge do not suggest that a cat can walk down a city street dressed in a black hat and tie. additionally, there is no logical connection between the premise and the hypothesis. step 2: the hypothesis 'the cat is walking' cannot be inferred from the premise as there is no information in the premise that relates to a cat or its actions. step 3: based on the logical analysis, the hypothesis 'the cat is walking' is not entailed by the premise."
1618,"Stupid, easily impressed yokels... My chest began to tighten.",The yokels scared us.,1,0,False,"step 1: the premise describes the speaker's emotional response (chest tightening) to being referred to as 'stupid, easily impressed yokels.' this phrase implies a derogatory or dismissive attitude towards the speaker and their group. no specific information is given about who or what caused this emotional response. step 2: the hypothesis suggests that the yokels were the cause of fear. a fear response is different from the emotional response described in the premise, so the hypothesis cannot be directly inferred from the premise. step 3: based on the given information, there is no logical connection between the premise and hypothesis. the hypothesis is not entailed by the premise."
1619,"You may find that you don't want to leave your hotel when you can spend the day being waited on hand and foot, but Long Bay also has a number of lively bars and restaurants to enjoy.",Long Bay has a number of lively bars and restaurants that are exclusive so you many not enjoy them. ,0,0,True,"step 1: in the premise, it is mentioned that long bay has a number of lively bars and restaurants. this implies that these establishments are available for visitors to enjoy. step 2: the hypothesis suggests that these bars and restaurants might be exclusive, which could potentially mean that not all visitors can access them. however, the premise does not provide any information about the exclusivity of these bars and restaurants. step 3: based on the given information, it is not logically possible to infer that the hypothesis is entailed by the premise. the premise only states that these bars and restaurants exist, and the hypothesis introduces a new element (exclusivity) without any supporting evidence. therefore, the hypothesis is not a logical consequence of the premise."
1621,"I shan't stop you.""",I don't want to stop you.,1,1,True,step 1: 'i shan't stop you' means 'i will not prevent you' or 'i won't interfere'. this implies a willingness or permission on the speaker's part.step 2: 'i don't want to stop you' means 'i have no desire to prevent you'. this statement also implies a lack of desire or willingness to interfere.step 3: the hypothesis 'i don't want to stop you' can be logically inferred from the premise 'i shan't stop you' because both statements convey the idea that the speaker does not intend to hinder or prevent the actions of the person being addressed.step 4: the hypothesis is entailed by the premise.
1622,"Parallel to the strategic bequest motive, we can hypothesize a strategic gift motive that operates while the parents are still alive.",Everyone gives for the same reasons.,0,0,True,"step 1: in the premise, a strategic bequest motive is introduced as a reason for certain actions by parents. this motive refers to the idea that parents may make decisions about their assets during their lifetime, or after their death, to benefit their children in specific ways. the hypothesis introduces a 'strategic gift motive', suggesting a similar concept but focusing on actions taken while parents are still alive. step 2: the hypothesis 'everyone gives for the same reasons' does not necessarily follow the premise directly. however, it could be possible that the 'same reasons' mentioned in the hypothesis refer to the strategic reasons described in the premise. in this case, the hypothesis could be considered a more generalized version of the premise. step 3: to determine the entailment, we would need more context or specific information to evaluate the accuracy of the hypothesis. the hypothesis might be too broad and abstract in its current form to be definitively entailed by the premise. a more concrete and specific version of the hypothesis, connected directly to the strategic bequest motive, might be more likely to be entailed by the premise."
1623,"Dave Hanson, your world was a world of rigid laws.","Dave Hanson, how you survived in your world beats me.",1,0,False,"step 1. in the premise, 'dave hanson, your world was a world of rigid laws,' we have a statement about the nature of dave hanson's world. it is described as a world with rigid laws, but we do not have any information about how dave hanson survived in such a world. the hypothesis, 'dave hanson, how you survived in your world beats me,' is an expression of uncertainty or amazement about how dave hanson survived.step 2. the hypothesis does not logically follow from the premise. the premise provides no information about how dave hanson survived or even implies that his survival was a challenge. the hypothesis is making an assumption that dave hanson's survival was difficult, which is not supported by the given information.step 3. based on the lack of logical connection and the absence of information in the premise that would allow us to infer the hypothesis, the hypothesis is not entailed by the premise."
1624,well i i uh when i first started out teaching it was uh at college level and then uh after we moved here to Dayton then i went to the high school level i really enjoyed that more and so then i taught the physical education actually uh with the i was the specialist in water safety and uh so i taught uh the  the physical education,I didn't expect to enjoy teaching high school more. ,1,0,False,"step 1: in the premise, the speaker initially taught at the college level but later transitioned to teaching at the high school level and found it more enjoyable. this implies a change in teaching level and a preference for the high school level. there is no contradictory information in the premise that would suggest an expectation or certainty about enjoying high school teaching.step 2: the hypothesis states that the speaker didn't expect to enjoy teaching high school more. this runs contrary to the information provided in the premise, as the speaker did, in fact, enjoy teaching at the high school level more.step 3: based on the information in the premise, it is not logically entailed that the speaker didn't expect to enjoy teaching high school more. the premise and hypothesis describe different aspects of the speaker's experience – the premise focuses on the speaker's actual experience and enjoyment, while the hypothesis deals with expectations.step 4: since the premise and hypothesis describe non-identical aspects of the situation, it is not possible to logically infer the hypothesis from the premise."
1625,GAGAS incorporate all AICPA field work and reporting auditing standards and the related SASs unless the Comptroller General of the United States excludes them by formal announcement.,GAGAS never formal announcements to exclude audit standards.,0,0,True,"step 1: the premise states that gagas (government auditing standards) incorporate all auditing standards and related statements on auditing standards (sass) of the aicpa (american institute of certified public accountants), except for those formally excluded by the comptroller general. the hypothesis suggests that no such formal announcements have been made to exclude any audit standards. step 2: the hypothesis does not contradict the premise as stated since the premise itself acknowledges the possibility of formal exclusions. however, if we consider the logical implications, the hypothesis can be seen as a stronger statement than the premise. the premise allows for some audit standards to be excluded, while the hypothesis suggests that none have been. step 3: while the hypothesis is not a logical entailment of the premise, it can be considered a reasonable inference based on the current state of affairs. there is no publicly available information suggesting that any formal exclusions have been made by the comptroller general. thus, given the available information, it is reasonable to infer that no formal announcements to exclude any audit standards have been made. step 4: based on the logical reasoning and available information, the hypothesis can be considered a reasonable inference from the premise, but it is not a logical entailment."
1626,"The silversmith's centuries-old skills, originally developed at the court of Perakiaare continued today in rural Kelantan.","The silversmith moved because he needed to, the times have changed.",1,0,False,"step 1: the premise describes the historical continuation of silversmithing skills in kelantan, which were originally developed at the court of perakia. the hypothesis suggests that the silversmith might have moved. step 2: there is no inherent contradiction between the premise and hypothesis. while the premise focuses on the continuation of the skills, it does not necessarily mean that the silversmith himself never moved. silversmithing could have continued in kelantan even if the silversmith himself relocated. step 3: the hypothesis is not logically entailed by the premise. the premise only states that the skills have been passed down and continue in kelantan, it does not guarantee that the silversmith himself has never moved. the hypothesis introduces new information not mentioned in the premise."
1627,"But sadly, I haven't had sex in five years.",I haven't kissed anyone in five years.,1,1,True,"step 1: in the premise, the speaker mentions that they haven't had sex in five years, which indicates a lack of intimate contact. step 2: the hypothesis suggests that the speaker hasn't kissed anyone in five years, which is a less intimate form of contact than sex. therefore, not having kissed anyone in five years is a reasonable assumption given the information in the premise. step 3: the hypothesis is entailed by the premise, as the former follows logically from the latter."
1628,no dealers will get get you on the oil changes anyway i took my car in one time many years ago for an oil change at the dealer and they charged me thirty dollars for it,My dealer gives me free oil changes.,0,0,True,"step 1: in the premise, the speaker mentions an experience where they were charged thirty dollars for an oil change at a dealer 'many years ago'. this information does not necessarily imply that all oil changes at this dealer come with a thirty-dollar fee. however, it does suggest that the cost of oil changes at this dealer is something the speaker is aware of and has found to be expensive.step 2: the hypothesis states that the speaker's dealer gives them free oil changes. this contradicts the information in the premise, as the premise indicates that the speaker has previously paid thirty dollars for an oil change at this dealer.step 3: based on the logical reasoning and factual inconsistency between the premise and hypothesis, the hypothesis is not entailed by the premise."
1629,The optimistic  The reforms will improve public perception of the IOC.,Some feel the reforms will improve the public and private perception of the IOC.,1,1,True,"step 1: in the premise, it is stated that the reforms will improve public perception of the ioc. this implies that there is a belief or expectation that the changes will lead to a more favorable view of the international olympic committee (ioc) by the general public.step 2: the hypothesis introduces the notion that not only the public but also the private perception of the ioc will be improved. this is a reasonable extension of the premise as there could be individuals or organizations in the private sector whose perception of the ioc is also relevant and could potentially be influenced by the reforms.step 3: based on the logical reasoning that the hypothesis extends the premise by considering the possibility of improved perception from the private sector, and the lack of contradictory information, the hypothesis can be inferred from the premise."
1630,yeah oh sure yeah you don't know really you don't know where it is,You know exactly where it is.,0,0,True,"step 1: in the premise, the speaker expresses uncertainty about a specific location using phrases like 'you don't know' and 'really you don't know where it is'. this indicates a lack of knowledge or certainty about the location.step 2: the hypothesis states that 'you know exactly where it is'. this is a direct contradiction to the premise as it asserts that the speaker has complete knowledge about the location, which is inconsistent with the expressed uncertainty.step 3: based on the logical contradiction between the premise and hypothesis, the hypothesis cannot be logically inferred from the premise.step 4: it is also important to note that the premise does not provide any context or information about what 'it' refers to, so making assumptions or drawing inferences based on external knowledge is not possible or appropriate."
1631,There is a blue bowl and a fruit platter on the table which is covered with a white tablecloth.,Food is on a table.,1,1,True,"step 1: in the premise, there is mentioned a blue bowl and a fruit platter on a table, which is covered with a white tablecloth. a tablecloth is a piece of fabric that is spread over a table to protect it or make it look more attractive. the presence of bowls and a fruit platter indicates the presence of food. step 2: the hypothesis 'food is on a table' can be logically inferred from the premise. this is because the premise states that there is a table with a blue bowl and a fruit platter on it, and it is common sense that bowls and platters are used to hold food. step 3: based on the logical reasoning and common sense, the hypothesis 'food is on a table' is entailed by the premise."
1632,"Then, all the time, it was in the spill vase in Mrs. Inglethorp's bedroom, under our very noses? I cried. ",You mean to say it was stupid for us to look so far and hard when it was always right beside us?,1,1,True,"step 1: in the premise, the speaker (implied to be the detective) is expressing surprise that the poison was in a commonplace location - mrs. inglethorp's bedroom - despite their extensive search. this implies that they had initially assumed the poison was hidden or hard to find. in the hypothesis, the speaker appears to be questioning the logic of their own search efforts, suggesting that the item was closer than they thought.step 2: the hypothesis seems to be a valid inference from the premise. the premise establishes that the poison was found in an unexpectedly accessible location. the hypothesis suggests that it was unreasonable to search extensively for something that was, in fact, close by.step 3: based on the logical relationship between the premise and hypothesis, and the absence of contradictory information, the hypothesis can be inferred from the premise."
1633,A woman with a purple purse sits on the metro with her suitcase.,A woman sitting down.,1,1,True,"step 1: in the premise, a woman is identified as sitting on the metro with a suitcase and a purple purse. this information provides a clear picture of a woman engaged in the action of sitting. step 2: the hypothesis 'a woman sitting down' is a more general statement about a woman performing the same action described in the premise. the hypothesis can be considered a special case of the information given in the premise. step 3: given that the premise and hypothesis describe the same action performed by a woman, the hypothesis can be inferred from the premise.step 4: furthermore, the hypothesis does not add any new information or contradict any information presented in the premise, making the inference valid."
1634,"Eszterhas' posturing  He became the celebrity he'd always hoped to be--brash, appealing, larger than life.",Eszterhas was a meek and modest person. ,0,0,True,"step 1: in the premise, eszterhas is described as 'brash, appealing, larger than life.' these adjectives suggest a bold, confident, and extroverted personality. step 2: the hypothesis, on the other hand, states that eszterhas was meek and modest. this statement contradicts the premise as meek and modest are not synonymous with brash, appealing, or larger than life. step 3: based on the provided information, the hypothesis cannot be logically inferred from the premise."
1635,"The riotous revelry roars right past Mardi Gras (Shrove Tuesday) when red-costumed children star as devils, to its peak on Ash Wednesday.",Mardi Gras is only the more common name because it is not specifically linked to religion.,1,0,False,"step 1: in the premise, mardi gras is described as a riotous revelry that begins before it and peaks on ash wednesday. this description does not directly indicate whether mardi gras is religious or not. however, it mentions the red-costumed children who represent devils, suggesting a connection to christian traditions as part of mardi gras celebrations. step 2: the hypothesis does not contradict the premise, as it does not claim anything directly about the religious or non-religious nature of mardi gras. however, it suggests that the name 'mardi gras' (which means 'fat tuesday' in french) may not specifically signify a religious origin. step 3: while the hypothesis does not contradict the premise, it does not follow logically from it either. the premise does not provide enough information to infer whether the name 'mardi gras' is linked to religion or not. common sense and historical facts tell us that mardi gras does indeed have religious origins in christian traditions, but this information is not explicitly stated in the premise. therefore, based on the given information, the hypothesis cannot be logically inferred from the premise."
1636,The unfairness of that jab pushed him off balance.,He stayed balanced and didn't even waiver at the jab. ,0,0,True,"step 1: the premise suggests that an 'unfairness' caused a 'push' which resulted in 'him off balance'. this implies a loss of equilibrium or control. step 2: the hypothesis states 'he stayed balanced and didn't even waiver at the jab'. this is in direct contradiction to the information provided in the premise. step 3: based on the logical contradiction and the clear difference in meaning between the premise and hypothesis, they cannot be logically inferred from each other.step 4: it is important to note that common sense and factual consistency should also be considered. in this case, it is highly unlikely for someone to not be affected at all by an 'unfairness' or 'jab', especially if it caused a 'push' that resulted in a loss of balance for the person in the premise.therefore, the hypothesis is not entailed by the premise."
1637,"In the final analysis, for any system to work you need to assure that the key people have integrity, that the information provided to key stakeholders is timely and reliable, and that the persons or entities that are providing assurance as to the reliability of any financial and non-financial information are qualified and independent both in fact and appearance.",The integrity of key people should be verified with self assessment surveys.,1,0,False,"step 1: in the premise, it is stated that for any system to work, key people need to have integrity, information provided to stakeholders must be timely and reliable, and persons or entities providing assurance must be qualified and independent. this implies a need for trustworthiness and accountability within the system.step 2: the hypothesis suggests that the integrity of key people should be verified using self-assessment surveys. while self-assessment surveys can provide useful data, they are inherently limited in their ability to fully assess the integrity of individuals, as people may not be entirely truthful or accurate in their responses.step 3: the hypothesis does not contradict the premise but it does not logically follow from it either. while self-assessment surveys can be a part of a comprehensive approach to ensuring the integrity of key people, they cannot be the sole means of verification. therefore, other methods, such as background checks, interviews, and references, should also be employed.step 4: in summary, the hypothesis that 'integrity of key people should be verified with self-assessment surveys' is not logically entailed by the premise, as the premise calls for a multifaceted approach to ensuring the integrity of key people, including timely and reliable information and qualified and independent persons or entities."
1638,"For the children, the Jardin d'Acclimatation offers a miniature railway, Punch and Judy show, house of distorting mirrors, pony rides, and a collection of farm animals.",Jardin d'Acclimation don't have the right to own animals.,0,0,True,"step 1: in the premise, it is mentioned that jardin d'acclimatation has a collection of farm animals. this information does not imply ownership, but it is a common assumption that organizations or individuals who have animals in their possession typically own them. step 2: the hypothesis directly contradicts the premise, stating that jardin d'acclimatation does not have the right to own animals. however, the premise itself does not provide sufficient evidence to logically infer the hypothesis. step 3: the hypothesis cannot be logically inferred from the premise as it contradicts the information in the premise, and there is no explicit statement or implication in the premise about jardin d'acclimatation not having the right to own animals."
1639,I can understand that.,I know why you feel that way.,1,0,False,"step 1: understanding 'i can understand that' implies recognizing the meaning or sense of what is being conveyed. it does not necessarily involve sharing the same feelings or experiences. 'i know why you feel that way' implies having an explanation for someone's emotions.step 2: while there is a conceptual connection between 'understanding' and 'knowing why', they are not identical. understanding something does not always imply knowing the reason behind it. there can be cases where one understands another's perspective without knowing the cause of their feelings.step 3: based on the given information and logical principles, the hypothesis 'i know why you feel that way' is not logically entailed by the premise 'i can understand that'. common sense would suggest that understanding someone's perspective does not necessarily mean knowing the reason behind it.therefore,"
1640,"Bharatanatyam, sometimes referred to as Bharathanatiyam or Sadir, is a major genre of Indian classical dance that originated in Tamil Nadu.","Bharatanatyam, sometimes referred to as Beanie Wells or Sadir, is a major genre of Indian classical dance that originated in Tamil Nadu.",1,1,True,"step 1: the premise provides information about the origin and name of the dance genre bharatanatyam. it mentions that it is a major genre of indian classical dance and that it originated in tamil nadu. the hypothesis closely resembles the premise by repeating the same information about bharatanatyam being a major genre of indian classical dance and originating in tamil nadu, but with a slight variation in one of the names used for the dance genre. step 2: the hypothesis can be logically inferred from the premise because the essential facts stated in the hypothesis are identical to those in the premise. the slight variation in the name does not change the meaning or logical implications of the statement. step 3: based on the logical similarity between the premise and hypothesis, and the absence of any contradictory information, the hypothesis can be inferred from the premise."
1641,In our family we have two sons in public life.,Our family has no members in public life.,0,0,True,"step 1: in the premise, it is stated that there are two sons in the family who are in public life. this means that these two individuals are known to hold positions or roles that are publicly recognized or prominent. step 2: the hypothesis, however, asserts that there are no members in the family in public life. this statement contradicts the information provided in the premise, as it implies that no family members hold any public positions or roles. step 3: therefore, based on the contradiction between the premise and hypothesis, the hypothesis cannot be logically inferred from the premise."
1642,"Consequently, the volumes and percentages of total cost for La Poste do not include unaddressed mail.",Unaddressed mail is factored into the percentages of total costs for La Poste.,0,0,True,"step 1: in the premise, it is stated that unaddressed mail is not included in the volumes and percentages of total cost for la poste. this implies that the cost of unaddressed mail is not explicitly accounted for in these measurements. step 2: the hypothesis suggests that unaddressed mail is factored into the percentages of total costs for la poste. however, the premise does not provide sufficient information to logically infer this. step 3: based on the given information, it is not possible to determine if the hypothesis is entailed by the premise. the premise only states what is included in the measurements of total cost, it does not specify what is excluded beyond unaddressed mail."
1643,If you missed the two top stories in yesterday's USAT --the government's first post-deregulation attempt to preserve competitiveness among airlines and the emergence of a drug that can prevent breast cancer--they are on the NYT 's front today.,These two story are causing an uproar among wide audiences.,1,1,True,"step 1: the premise describes two significant stories from the usat that were noteworthy enough to appear on the nyt's front page. this implies that these stories had broad interest or importance. step 2: the hypothesis suggests that these stories are causing an uproar among wide audiences. such a reaction implies a high level of interest or concern. step 3: given the information from the premise about the significance and broad interest of the stories, it is plausible and reasonable to infer that these stories would indeed cause an uproar among wide audiences. step 4: the hypothesis is consistent with the facts provided in the premise, and there is no contradiction between them. therefore, the hypothesis can be logically inferred from the premise."
1644,A graying man with glasses is standing in back of a barber's chair in a seemingly empty barber shop.,A man is standing in a barber shop.,1,1,True,"step 1: in the premise, a man (graying, with glasses) is described as being in a barber shop and standing in front of a barber chair. this information indicates that there is a man present in a barber shop setting. step 2: the hypothesis also asserts the presence of a man in a barber shop. since the premise's description of the man aligns with the general description in the hypothesis, the hypothesis can be considered a special case of the premise. step 3: based on the logical relationship between the premise and hypothesis, and the lack of contradictory information, the hypothesis can be inferred from the premise."
1645,"Though physically part of the Louvre, the Mus??e des Arts D??coratifs is a separate museum with its own entrance at 107 Rue de Rivoli.","The Mus??e des Arts D??coratifs is a popular museum, located ten miles west of the Lourve.",0,0,True,"step 1: the premise establishes that the musée des arts décoratifs is a separate museum with its own entrance at 107 rue de rivoli, which is physically part of the louvre. no information is provided about the popularity or location of the museum. step 2: the hypothesis makes an unjustified claim about the museum being popular and its location being ten miles west of the louvre. there is no logical connection or common sense reasoning between these statements and the information given in the premise. step 3: based on the given premise, the hypothesis cannot be logically inferred."
1646,Her voice was doubtful.,She was doubtful because the plan did not seem very good.,1,1,True,"step 1: a doubtful voice often indicates uncertainty or skepticism. the premise provides no direct information about the cause of her doubtful voice. however, it is a common sense assumption that people often express their doubts or skepticism through their voices. step 2: the hypothesis provides an explanation for why her voice might have been doubtful - because she did not think the plan was good. this explanation aligns with the information in the premise, as doubt or skepticism is a reasonable response to a plan that does not seem good. step 3: based on the logical reasoning that a doubtful voice can be an expression of doubt or skepticism, and the common-sense understanding that a person might doubt a plan that does not seem good, the hypothesis can be inferred from the premise.step 4: it's also important to note that the hypothesis does not necessarily have to specify the exact words used in the premise, as long as the meaning is the same. in this case, 'her voice was doubtful' and 'she was doubtful' convey the same meaning.step 5: the hypothesis does not contradict the premise, as it only provides additional context and an explanation for the doubtful voice described in the premise.therefore, the hypothesis can be inferred from the premise."
1647,what uh how they develop uh what the candidate stands for the you know the views and uh,There is no candidate in the election at all.,0,0,True,"step 1: in the premise, it discusses a candidate's views and development, indicating that there is indeed a candidate in the election. this is a factual given. step 2: the hypothesis states that 'there is no candidate in the election at all'. this directly contradicts the information provided in the premise. step 3: based on the logical negation of the facts given in the premise, the hypothesis cannot be logically inferred or entailed, given the contradiction."
1648,Debriefing organization can be based on non - linear or a combination of both organization of markers used for recall.,Debriefing organization can be based on linear or non-linear (or a combination of both) organization of markers used for recall.,1,1,True,"step 1: in the premise, it is stated that a debriefing organization can be based on non-linear or a combination of both linear and non-linear organization of markers used for recall. this implies that there are different ways a debriefing organization can be structured, with non-linear being one of them and a combination of both being another.step 2: the hypothesis suggests that a debriefing organization can be based on linear or non-linear (or a combination of both) organization of markers used for recall. this is identical to the premise, with the only difference being the order of the options listed. since the hypothesis does not add, subtract, or contradict any information in the premise, it can be logically inferred from the premise.step 3: based on the logical equivalence between the premise and hypothesis, the hypothesis is entailed by the premise."
1649,A scout who travels through a storm like the torrent with nothing but a skin of blood to sustain him is likely to be one of their better men.,Scouts are not able to travel through storms.,0,0,True,"step 1: in the premise, a scout is described as traveling through a storm 'like the torrent' with only a 'skin of blood' to sustain him. this implies that the scout is very experienced and resilient, able to endure extreme conditions. the premise does not suggest that it is impossible for scouts to travel through storms, but rather that this particular scout is exceptional. common sense and logical consistency suggest that the ability to travel through a storm is a skill possessed by some scouts, not all of them.step 2: the hypothesis 'scouts are not able to travel through storms' contradicts the information provided in the premise, which describes a scout who is able to travel through a storm. the hypothesis cannot be logically inferred from the premise.step 3: based on the logical analysis and the contradiction between the premise and hypothesis, the hypothesis is not entailed by the premise."
1650,Where alternative country runs into trouble is its tendency to ignore what's durable about country in favor of its stereotypical hay-bales-and-whiskey-bottles shtick.,The stereotypical subject matter of alternative country will make it stand the test of time.,0,0,True,"step 1: the premise discusses a tendency of alternative country music to overlook the enduring aspects of country in favor of stereotypical themes. it does not provide an evaluation of the value or longevity of these stereotypical themes. step 2: the hypothesis posits that these same stereotypical themes will make alternative country stand the test of time. this is a contradiction of the premise as it suggests the opposite of what the premise asserts. step 3: based on the logical analysis, the hypothesis cannot be inferred from the premise as it contradicts the information provided."
1651,A baby wearing yellow is pretending to be a doctor while inside a stroller.,A baby is role playing as a professional,1,1,True,"step 1: in the premise, a baby is described as wearing yellow and pretending to be a doctor inside a stroller. the key information here is that the baby is role-playing. role-playing is an activity where an individual acts out a situation or character. it is a common behavior in children, where they imitate adults and their professions.step 2: the hypothesis states that a baby is role playing as a professional. this hypothesis is equivalent to the premise in meaning, as both describe the baby engaging in role-playing behavior, but the hypothesis is more general and not limited to the specific profession of a doctor.step 3: based on the logical reasoning and equivalence of the two statements, the hypothesis can be inferred from the premise."
1652,He looked down at the tattoos that crossed the large man's chest.,He didn't notice that the large man had tattoos.,0,0,True,"step 1: the premise states that the person looked at the tattoos on the large man's chest, indicating that he was aware of their presence. step 2: the hypothesis suggests that he didn't notice the tattoos, which contradicts the information in the premise. the hypothesis cannot be inferred from the premise. step 3: based on the logical analysis, the hypothesis is not entailed by the premise."
1653,"Because the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) determined that this was an economically significant regulatory action under Executive Order 12866, the Natural Resources Conservation Service (NRCS) conducted an economic analysis of the potential impacts associated with this program.",The Office of Management and Budget has strict regulations.,1,1,True,"step 1: in the premise, it is stated that the omb determined that a regulatory action was economically significant and therefore required an economic analysis. this indicates that the omb has the authority to make such determinations and the process involves some level of regulatory oversight. step 2: the hypothesis asserts that the office of management and budget has strict regulations. this is a logical inference from the premise because the premise implies that the omb has the power and process in place to enforce economic analysis for economically significant regulatory actions. step 3: based on the logical connection between the premise and hypothesis and the lack of contradictory information, the hypothesis can be inferred from the premise."
1654,and it was eight years before i had to do it again,I had to hang the drywall after eight years.,1,0,False,"step 1: in the premise, the speaker mentions that it was eight years before they had to do 'it' again. the context is not clear about what 'it' refers to, but the number eight years implies a significant time lapse. step 2: in the hypothesis, the speaker is stating that they had to hang drywall after eight years. while the premise does not explicitly mention drywall, there is no contradiction or incompatibility between the premise and hypothesis. hanging drywall is an action that could reasonably occur after a significant time lapse. step 3: based on the lack of contradiction and the possibility that 'it' in the premise could refer to hanging drywall, the hypothesis could be inferred from the premise, although the premise does not entail the hypothesis directly."
1655,yeah i think i'll probably just have to go with one of those splint braces or something,The doctors will most likely say to use a splint brace. ,1,1,True,"step 1: in the premise, the speaker is expressing their intention to consult doctors regarding an injury, and they believe that one of the solutions suggested by the doctors will be a splint brace. this implies that the doctors have the expertise and authority to make such a recommendation.step 2: in the hypothesis, it is proposed that the doctors will suggest using a splint brace. this is a reasonable inference from the premise as the speaker is planning to consult the doctors and expects them to recommend a splint brace as a solution.step 3: based on the logical connection between the premise and hypothesis, and the common sense understanding that doctors have the expertise to recommend treatments, the hypothesis can be inferred from the premise."
1656,well i don't think i'd ever make a song writer,I know that I don't have the talent to write songs.,1,0,False,"step 1: in the premise, the speaker expresses their opinion that they do not possess the ability to compose songs. this is a subjective statement, but it implies a lack of talent or skill in songwriting. step 2: the hypothesis also expresses a lack of talent or ability in songwriting, stating it as a fact. this hypothesis is consistent with the information provided in the premise. no logical contradiction exists between the two statements. step 3: although there is no direct entailment relationship between the premise and hypothesis, they are equivalent in meaning. both statements convey the idea that the speaker is not capable of writing songs. therefore, while the hypothesis is not logically derived from the premise, it is a reasonable inference based on the information provided in the premise."
1658,yeah it's got no,It has brakes.,1,0,False,"step 1: in the premise, no explicit information is provided about the object having brakes. it only states 'yeah it's got no'. this suggests that the object is being described as lacking something, but the identity or nature of that something is not clear.step 2: the hypothesis, 'it has brakes', is a statement about a property or feature of the object that is not mentioned in the premise. this makes it impossible to logically infer the hypothesis from the premise alone, as the premise does not provide sufficient information to support the hypothesis.step 3: based on the lack of information in the premise and the contradictory nature of the hypothesis (given that the premise states the object lacks something), the hypothesis cannot be inferred from the premise."
1659,"Several pro-life Dems are mounting serious campaigns at the state level, often against pro-choice Republicans.",These democrats will do anything to get pro-life to become nationwide.,1,0,False,"step 1: in the premise, several pro-life democrats are identified as mounting serious campaigns at the state level against pro-choice republicans. this implies that these democrats hold pro-life views, and they are actively trying to influence political decisions at the state level. step 2: the hypothesis does not explicitly state that these democrats will 'do anything' to make pro-life a nationwide issue. however, it's important to note that the premise does not provide evidence suggesting that these democrats' actions are unreasonable or beyond the scope of normal political activity. in fact, their actions align with the democratic process, as they are campaigning for political office. step 3: based on the information given, the hypothesis is not logically entailed by the premise. while the premise implies that these democrats are actively working on pro-life issues, it does not logically follow that they will 'do anything' to make it a nationwide issue."
1660,"Norm, I see that Gene's performance is tomorrow---afternoon.",They forgot that it was tomorrow.,1,0,False,"step 1: in the premise, the speaker states that they have been informed about gene's performance taking place tomorrow afternoon. this information is presented as a fact. step 2: the hypothesis suggests that someone (implicitly 'they') have forgotten that it is tomorrow. forgetting an event can sometimes result in not attending or preparing for it appropriately. however, the premise does not provide any evidence that the event in question (gene's performance) will not happen or that anyone involved has forgotten about it. step 3: based on the given information, the hypothesis is not logically entailed by the premise. the premise only establishes that gene's performance is scheduled for tomorrow afternoon, while the hypothesis suggests that someone has forgotten about it. without further context or evidence, it is impossible to infer that from the premise alone."
1663,They caught up with me in Salvora.,I ran away to Salvora to stay safe.,1,0,False,"step 1: the premise indicates that 'they' found the person (referred to as 'i') in salvora. this does not provide any information about the reason why the person was in salvora or the intentions behind going there. step 2: the hypothesis suggests that the person went to salvora with the intention of staying safe, which is not directly stated or implied in the premise. however, the hypothesis is not contradictory to the premise, as it's possible that the person went to salvora to stay safe before being caught up with. step 3: based on the given information, the hypothesis cannot be logically inferred from the premise, as the premise does not provide enough context to support the hypothesis. however, it's important to note that the absence of contradiction does not automatically imply entailment."
1664,"That's precisely because it has a stake, through its TV channels, in baseball rather than just in the Dodgers.",That's because it has a stake in the Dodgers and benefits when they are on TV.,1,1,True,"step 1: in the premise, it is stated that the company has a stake in baseball through its tv channels, not just in the dodgers. this implies that the company derives some benefit from broadcasting baseball games in general. step 2: the hypothesis suggests that the company benefits from the dodgers being on tv, which is a specific instance of the company benefiting from baseball being on tv, as mentioned in the premise. step 3: the hypothesis can be reasonably inferred from the premise, as the hypothesis is a more specific instance of the broader situation described in the premise.step 1 also involves recognizing the logical connection between having a stake in baseball and benefiting from broadcasting baseball games. step 2 involves recognizing the logical connection between benefiting from baseball in general and benefiting specifically from the dodgers being on tv.step 3: based on the logical connections and the common sense understanding that a company having a financial stake in an organization or event typically benefits from its success or visibility, the hypothesis can be inferred from the premise."
1665,"Her events are the 400 metre hurdles, 400 metres and long jump.","Her events are the 400 metre hurdles, 401 metres and long jump.",0,1,False,"step 1: in the premise, 'her events' are specified as the 400 metre hurdles, 400 metres, and long jump. these are all track and field events. in the hypothesis, 'her events' are the same, but the second distance event is stated as 401 metres instead of 400 metres. step 2: changing the second distance event from 400 metres to 401 metres is a minor modification. the difference is one metre, which is insignificant in the context of track and field events. the hypothesis is still logically consistent with the premise, as it describes the same three events. step 3: based on the logical consistency and the minor modification, the hypothesis can be inferred from the premise."
1666,I should have carried it away with me. ,I should have left it behind.,0,0,True,"step 1: the premise suggests that there was an object that the speaker regrets not bringing with them. they express this regret using the conditional 'should have' and the past tense 'carried'. step 2: the hypothesis also uses the conditional 'should have' but suggests the opposite action of leaving the object behind instead of bringing it. step 3: while the premise and hypothesis both use 'should have' and express regret, they suggest opposite actions. it's important to note that 'should have' does not necessarily imply logical entailment, as it can represent a counterfactual or a suggestion. in this case, the hypothesis is not logically entailed by the premise because they suggest contradictory actions."
1667,"Is that a reactionary bastion, a pathetic anachronism, or something truer, something with enough confidence to survive without media ratification.",We will find out about its true nature soon enough.,1,1,True,"step 1: in the premise, the speaker is questioning the nature of something, using terms like 'reactionary bastion,' 'pathetic anachronism,' and 'something truer.' these terms suggest that the speaker has certain perceptions or beliefs about the subject, but they do not provide clear or definite information about its true nature. the question 'or something truer, something with enough confidence to survive without media ratification' implies that the speaker is uncertain and is looking for more information. step 2: the hypothesis, 'we will find out about its true nature soon enough,' suggests that new information will be revealed that will clarify the nature of the subject. this is a reasonable inference given the uncertainty expressed in the premise. step 3: based on the premise's uncertainty about the subject's nature and the logical progression from questioning to seeking answers, the hypothesis can be inferred as a logical next step.step 4: it's important to note that the hypothesis does not provide a definitive answer to the nature of the subject, but rather states that we will find out about it soon. the premise and hypothesis do not contradict each other, and the hypothesis is consistent with the uncertainty expressed in the premise.therefore, the hypothesis can be inferred from the premise."
1668,He wondered if this recommendation was the appropriate place.,The recommendation was innapropriate,0,0,True,"step 1: the premise describes a situation where someone is questioning whether a recommendation is suitable. it does not provide any information about the nature of the recommendation or why it might be inappropriate. the hypothesis, on the other hand, states that the recommendation was inappropriate. step 2: while the hypothesis cannot be directly inferred from the premise, as there is no mention of the recommendation being inappropriate in the premise, the hypothesis does not contradict it. this is because the premise only establishes that there is doubt about the appropriateness of the recommendation, not that it is known to be appropriate. step 3: in the absence of direct entailment, the hypothesis cannot be logically inferred from the premise. however, the premise does not rule out the possibility of the hypothesis being true, so it remains an open question."
1669,"LIFE-CYCLE COSTING - An acquisition or procurement technique which considers operating, maintenance, and other costs in addition to the acquisition cost of assets.",Life-cycle costing does not take into consideration operating and maintenance costs.,0,0,True,"step 1: in the premise, 'life-cycle costing' is defined as a technique that considers acquisition cost, operating cost, and maintenance cost. this implies that the costs of operating and maintenance are integral parts of life-cycle costing. step 2: the hypothesis directly contradicts the information in the premise. if life-cycle costing did not take into consideration operating and maintenance costs, it would not fit the definition provided. step 3: based on the contradictory nature of the hypothesis to the premise, the hypothesis is not logically entailed by the premise."
1670,"Initially this movie was offered to Armaan Kohli and Salman Khan to play the lead role, but they all rejected it as the role had negative shades .","Initially this movie was offered to Toktokkies and Salman Khan to play the lead role, but they all rejected it as the role had negative shades.",0,1,False,"step 1. in the premise, we have information about a movie and the actors armaan kohli and salman khan being offered the lead role but rejecting it due to the negative shades of the character. step 2. the hypothesis introduces a new actor, toktokkies, with identical circumstances of being offered a movie with negative role shades and rejecting it. the actions and circumstances are identical for both armaan kohli, salman khan and toktokkies in the premise and hypothesis. step 3. based on the logical equivalence of the situations described in the premise and hypothesis, the hypothesis can be inferred from the premise."
1671,no i sure haven't it's i think it's supposed to be nice though,It's supposed to be terrible.,0,0,True,"step 1: in the premise, the speaker is expressing their personal opinion that they haven't had something, but they think it's supposed to be nice. hypothesis presents a contradictory opinion that it's supposed to be terrible. step 2: opinions don't logically follow each other directly, as they are subjective and based on individual perspectives. while two contradictory opinions can't both be true, one can't be logically inferred from the other based on the given information. step 3: based on the lack of logical connection and the contradictory nature of the opinions, the hypothesis can't be logically inferred from the premise."
1672,"Greece attempted to stay out of World War II, but Mussolini saw Greece as an ideal addition to his Italian empire.",Mussolini was uninterested in Greece.,0,0,True,"step 1: in the premise, it is stated that mussolini saw greece as an ideal addition to his italian empire, which indicates that mussolini had an interest in greece. contrarily, the hypothesis suggests that mussolini was uninterested in greece. step 2: given the information in the premise, the hypothesis is not logically entailed. in fact, it contradicts the premise. step 3: based on the logical negation of the premise's content, the hypothesis cannot be inferred from the premise."
1673,"No, right the other side of the room. ",It's this side of the room we're concerned with.,0,0,True,"step 1: the premise 'no, right the other side of the room' indicates a statement made by a person, likely in response to a question or situation, implying that the speaker is referring to a location on the other side of the room. this is based on the common understanding of the english language, as 'no' often signals disagreement or denial, and 'right' typically means 'on that side'. step 2: the hypothesis 'it's this side of the room we're concerned with' suggests a shift in focus to the side of the room opposite the premise. this could potentially be an inference if the speaker in the premise was mistaken or the situation has changed. step 3: while the hypothesis can't be definitively ruled out without more context, it is not a logical inference from the premise, as the premise does not provide enough information to directly support the hypothesis. therefore, the hypothesis is not entailed by the premise. step 4: it's possible that the two statements could be compatible in certain situations, but without further context, it's not clear how they relate logically."
1674,The Woman in Me commenced with small sales but eventually led Twain to commercial success.,The Woman in Me commenced with small sales but eventually led Walker to commercial success.,0,0,True,"step 1: in the premise, 'the woman in me' is identified as leading twain to commercial success. 'the woman in me' is a literary work by mark twain. no specific information is given about the identity of 'walker' in the hypothesis.step 2: the hypothesis suggests that 'the woman in me' led walker to commercial success instead of twain. however, there is no logical connection or consistency between the premise and hypothesis as mark twain and walker are different individuals.step 3: based on the given information, the hypothesis cannot be logically inferred from the premise as they refer to different people."
1675,"The few public tennis courts in Paris are on a first-come-first-serve basis, as at the Jardin du Luxembourg.",People wake and go to the public tennis courts early in the morning in order to play.,1,1,True,"step 1: in the premise, it is mentioned that the public tennis courts in paris function on a first-come-first-serve basis. this implies that there is limited availability of these courts. common sense suggests that people might want to secure a spot to play tennis, especially if they have a commitment or specific time in mind. step 2: the hypothesis 'people wake and go to the public tennis courts early in the morning in order to play' can be logically inferred from the premise as it explains the reason why people might wake up early and go to the tennis courts. if the tennis courts are on a first-come-first-serve basis, going early increases the likelihood of getting a spot. step 3: based on the logical reasoning and common sense, the hypothesis can be inferred from the premise."
1677,"There are few hippies left today, but the pleasures are still pretty  it's not unusual to see topless sunbathers or catch a faint whiff of  aromatic  smoke.",The hippy culture died out forever there.,0,0,True,"step 1: in the premise, it is mentioned that there are few hippies left today, but some elements of the hippie culture, such as topless sunbathing and the smell of aromatic smoke, are still present. this implies that while the number of hippies has diminished, some aspects of the hippie culture continue to exist. step 2: the hypothesis, 'the hippy culture died out forever', is a strong statement that directly contradicts this implication. if the hypothesis were true, then neither the topless sunbathers nor the aromatic smoke would be present. step 3: given the contradiction between the premise and hypothesis, the hypothesis cannot be logically inferred from the premise. step 4: it's essential to understand that the absence of evidence is not evidence of absence. the fact that the premise mentions the presence of some hippie culture elements does not prove that the entire culture is still alive, but it does make the hypothesis that the culture has disappeared in its entirety an unjustified conclusion based on the given information."
1678,and they were being the judge was being especially careful that everything was done correctly so there couldn't be a a mistrial of any kind uh the uh,A mistrial would be in the best interest of the defendant.  ,1,0,False,"step 1: in the premise, the judge's actions indicate a strong commitment to ensuring a fair and error-free trial. this implies that the judge values a verdict based on accurate and complete evidence.step 2: the hypothesis suggests that a mistrial would benefit the defendant. however, the premise implies that a mistrial would not occur due to the judge's diligence. in addition, a mistrial generally means that the current trial is terminated without reaching a verdict, which could be unfavorable for the defendant as it may require a new trial and increased publicity.step 3: based on the information provided in the premise and the logical inconsistency between the premise and the hypothesis, it is clear that the hypothesis is not entailed by the premise. in fact, the hypothesis contradicts the premise as the premise implies that a mistrial is unlikely and not in the defendant's best interest."
1679,"That, too, was locked or bolted on the inside. ",She didn't want anyone to enter the room. ,1,1,True,"step 1: in the premise, 'that, too, was locked or bolted on the inside', we have a statement about a door being locked from the inside. this implies a desire for privacy or security, as it is common sense that locking a door from the inside is a way to prevent others from entering.  step 2: the hypothesis, 'she didn't want anyone to enter the room', can be logically inferred from the premise. the action of locking the door from the inside is a clear indication that the person inside did not want anyone to enter. the hypothesis expands on this logical connection by stating the intent behind the action.  step 3: based on the logical reasoning and common sense, the hypothesis is entailed by the premise."
1680,so you're right they could do something about about that i guess,They need to take action soon.,1,1,True,"step 1: in the premise, 'they could do something about that', the speaker acknowledges that there's an issue that requires attention and suggests that action might be taken. 'about that' refers to a specific situation or problem. the use of 'could' implies a possibility, but no explicit commitment to action has been made. the hypothesis 'they need to take action soon' is a more definitive statement about the necessity of taking action in a timely manner.step 2: the hypothesis is consistent with the premise, as taking action soon is a reasonable response to an issue that requires attention. the premise does not contradict the hypothesis, as it does not specify a time frame for when action should be taken.step 3: based on the information provided and logical reasoning, the hypothesis can be inferred from the premise as it is a stronger statement that aligns with the implications of the premise."
1681,many boys transfer to other preparatory schools from the age of eight.,"Children are educated from the ages of three to eleven, but many boys transfer to other preparatory schools from the age of eight.",1,1,True,"step 1: in the premise, 'many boys transfer to other preparatory schools from the age of eight.', we have a statement about the age at which many boys transfer schools. the given age range for children's education in the hypothesis, 'children are educated from the ages of three to eleven,' includes this age. this means that the information in the hypothesis is a specific case within the more general premise.step 2: the hypothesis can be logically inferred from the premise as it provides additional information about 'many boys' and the age at which they transfer schools. this detail is not contradictory to the premise and is a valid expansion of the information presented.step 3: based on the logical relationship between the premise and hypothesis, the hypothesis is entailed by the premise."
1682,"The terrible, terrifying darkness beyond consumed him.",The darkness soothed him,0,0,True,"step 1: the premise describes a person being consumed by a 'terrible, terrifying darkness beyond'. the term 'consumed' suggests a complete engulfment or absorption by the darkness. however, the premise does not provide any context or information about the person's feelings or reactions towards the darkness.step 2: the hypothesis proposes a contradictory scenario where the darkness 'soothed' the person. there is no logical connection or implication between the premise and the hypothesis based on the given information. common sense and logical principles do not support the hypothesis being inferred from the premise, as the premise does not provide any evidence of the darkness having a soothing effect.step 3: based on the logical reasoning and lack of entailment between the premise and hypothesis, the hypothesis is not entailed by the premise."
1683,toddlers playing with toys.,The toddler is alone and asleep in his bed.,0,0,True,"step 1: in the premise, 'toddlers playing with toys' describes a scenario of young children interacting with toys. there is no specific information about the number of toddlers, their locations, or their current states. common sense and factual knowledge do not suggest that toddlers being alone and asleep in their beds while playing with toys is a typical or necessary part of this scenario. step 2: 'the toddler is alone and asleep in his bed' directly contradicts the information in the premise, as the premise describes toddlers as playing with toys, an activity that is typically associated with being awake and engaged. step 3: based on the logical analysis, it is clear that the hypothesis cannot be inferred from the premise as it contradicts the key information provided in the premise."
1684,"First, they should provide strategic advice to management in order to help maximize shareholder value.",Management may not be happy about being told what to do.,1,0,False,"step 1: in the premise, consultants are advised to give strategic advice to management with the goal of maximizing shareholder value. this implies a professional relationship between the consultants and management, with the consultants in an advisory role. step 2: the hypothesis suggests a potential reaction from management that may not be positive, i.e., they may not be happy about being told what to do. although this emotion is not explicitly stated in the premise, it's not an unreasonable assumption that managers might not always welcome external advice. step 3: the hypothesis does not directly contradict the premise as it does not negate the action of giving strategic advice. it is, however, important to note that the hypothesis does not follow logically from the premise since the premise does not specify how management will react to the advice. furthermore, the premise does not provide enough information to definitively infer that the hypothesis is true or false. step 4: given the information in the premise and hypothesis, neither entailment nor contradiction can be established, and the relationship between the two is ambiguous."
1685,"See you Aug. 12, or soon thereafter, we hope.",The person was going to attend on August 12.,1,1,True,"step 1: in the premise, the speaker expresses the intention to see someone 'on aug. 12, or soon thereafter.' this implies that the person intends to be present at a specific location on aug. 12 or shortly after that date.step 2: the hypothesis states that 'the person was going to attend' on aug. 12. this is a direct implication of the premise since 'attend' refers to the act of being present at a particular event or place.step 3: based on the logical relationship between the premise and hypothesis, it can be inferred that the hypothesis is a logical entailment of the premise."
1686,yeah what uh the current climate is i saw a little flyer and uh i thought it was interesting uh is they are now offering you know flex flexible benefits where you have more control and allocate uh like you can uh pay for uh vacation time if you want to take more vacation you can just buy them out or something like that so i can can do other things and uh,"I saw the flyer and I found it boring and misleading, they are now supposedly offering more flexible benefits but I could care less.",0,0,True,"step 1: in the premise, the speaker mentions seeing a flyer about flexible benefits and expresses interest in it. no specific information is given about the nature of these benefits or why they are interesting. in the hypothesis, the speaker also mentions seeing the same flyer but expresses disinterest and the perception of it being boring and misleading.step 2: the hypothesis does not logically follow from the premise. while both sentences mention the flyer and the speaker's reaction to it, the hypothesis goes beyond the information provided in the premise by making a negative assessment of the flyer's content. the premise does not provide any evidence or context suggesting that the benefits are, in fact, boring or misleading.step 3: based on the given information, there is no entailment relationship between the hypothesis and the premise."
1687,But he is older now.,But he is younger now.,0,0,True,"step 1: the premise describes a statement about 'he' being older now. this means that the current age of 'he' is greater than it was in some previous context. step 2: the hypothesis states that 'he' is younger now, which directly contradicts the information in the premise. a person being younger implies an age that is less than it was in some previous context. step 3: based on the logical negation of the premise information in the hypothesis and the clear contradiction between the two statements, the hypothesis is not entailed by the premise."
1688,"'You have two days to get this thing working like a person, right?' Derry asked.",Derry said that there were three weeks left to the project.,0,0,True,"step 1: the premise indicates that derry asked if they had two days to get a 'thing' working like a person. the term 'thing' is not defined, but it implies some kind of project or task. the context does not provide any information about the duration of the project or the date. common sense suggests that the time given, two days, is relatively short for completing a complex project.step 2: the hypothesis states that derry said there were three weeks left to the project. this statement contradicts the premise, as the number of weeks given is significantly larger than the number of days.step 3: based on the given information, the hypothesis cannot be logically inferred from the premise. in fact, the hypothesis contradicts the premise."
1690,A man in a blue shirt and light blue cap walks by a working scale model of an antique freight train.,a guy with a shirt and hat walks past a train,1,1,True,"step 1: in the premise, we have specific details about the man's clothing – a blue shirt and a light blue cap. the scene also involves a working scale model of an antique freight train. the term 'guy' in the hypothesis is a general term for a man. 'shirt and hat' in the hypothesis is a more general description of the man's attire than in the premise. the term 'past a train' in the hypothesis refers to being near or close to a train.step 2: the hypothesis can be logically inferred from the premise because 'a man with a shirt and hat walks past a train' is a more general description of the situation described in the premise. the man's clothing and being near a train are common elements in both the premise and hypothesis.step 3: based on the logical reasoning and the fact that the hypothesis is a more general description of the situation in the premise, the hypothesis can be inferred from the premise."
1691,"If Mr. Inglethorp did take it, he has had ample time to replace it by now.""",Mr. Inglethorp could have replaced the painting with a fake one with all the time he's had.,1,0,False,"step 1: in the premise, it is stated that if mr. inglethorp took the painting, he has had ample time to replace it. this implies that the replacement of the painting is a possibility. the hypothesis suggests that mr. inglethorp could have replaced the painting with a fake one. both the premise and hypothesis deal with the replacement of the painting.step 2: the hypothesis does not directly follow from the premise, but it does not contradict it either. the premise only implies that mr. inglethorp had the opportunity to replace the painting, it does not necessarily mean that he did. the hypothesis suggests a specific way in which he could have replaced the painting.step 3: based on the given information, there is no definitive way to determine if the hypothesis is entailed by the premise or not. the premise leaves open the possibility of mr. inglethorp having replaced the painting, but it does not specify with certainty that he did so with a fake one. therefore, the hypothesis cannot be logically inferred from the premise, but it is not necessarily contradictory either."
1692,Wait and plan? ,The group jumped on it without thinking.,0,0,True,"step 1: in the premise, 'wait and plan' implies a deliberate and considered approach. this implies that the group is taking time to think before taking action. the hypothesis, 'the group jumped on it without thinking,' suggests an impulsive and hasty action. these two ideas are logically opposites. step 2: the hypothesis cannot be logically inferred from the premise because the premise does not suggest or imply the impulsive and hasty actions stated in the hypothesis. step 3: based on the logical analysis, the hypothesis is not entailed by the premise."
1693,Watch the fantan dealer for a few minutes and you'll almost be an It's simply a matter of how many odd buttons are left after he has divided a pile of them into groups of four.,"The game of fantan is truly difficult to understand, and near-impossible to master.",0,0,True,"step 1: the premise describes a situation where someone can learn the basics of a fantan game by observing how many odd buttons remain after the dealer divides the pile into groups of four. this implies that there is a pattern or rule in the game that can be learned with some observation. however, this observation does not provide any specific information about the complexity of the game or the difficulty of mastering it.step 2: the hypothesis states that the game of fantan is truly difficult to understand and near-impossible to master. this is a subjective statement and not directly related to the information provided in the premise. the premise only suggests that there is a pattern or rule that can be learned with observation. it does not imply that the game is difficult to understand or master in an absolute sense.step 3: based on the information provided in the premise, the hypothesis cannot be logically inferred. the premise does not provide enough information to support the hypothesis that the game is difficult to understand and near-impossible to master."
1694,It's not often that the rank and file get together to talk about their problems.,The rank and file get together often to talk about other things besides their problems. ,1,0,False,"step 1: in the premise, it is stated that it's not often that the rank and file get together to talk about their problems. this implies that there are situations where they do get together for other reasons. step 2: the hypothesis suggests that the rank and file get together often to talk about things other than their problems. if this is true, it would contradict the premise since the premise states that it's not often they get together for such discussions. step 3: however, the hypothesis does not necessarily contradict the premise if we consider the possibility that when the rank and file get together, they may discuss their problems less frequently than one might expect but still do so on some occasions. in this case, the hypothesis could be true, and it would not contradict the premise as long as it's understood that the 'other things' they talk about do not exclude their problems. step 4: in order to determine if the hypothesis can be reasonably inferred from the premise, we need additional context or clarification about the frequency and nature of the gatherings mentioned in the premise and hypothesis. in the absence of such information, a definitive answer cannot be given.step 5: based on the given information, the hypothesis cannot be logically inferred from the premise with certainty, but it is not an outright contradiction either. the premise and hypothesis could both be true under certain interpretations.your reasoning may vary based on the specific context of the situation and the available information."
1695,The building on the site dates from 1591 and served as a council chamber and courthouse for the town in addition to collecting tolls.,"The building, which dates from 1800, never served as a courthouse.",0,0,True,"step 1: in the premise, the building's date (1591) and historical functions (council chamber, courthouse, and toll collection) are provided. in the hypothesis, the building's date (1800) is stated, and it claims that the building 'never served as a courthouse'. step 2: the hypothesis contradicts the premise because, according to the premise, the building did indeed serve as a courthouse during the 16th century. step 3: based on the contradiction between the premise and hypothesis, the hypothesis cannot be logically inferred from the premise. in fact, the hypothesis states something that is not true according to the premise."
1696,yeah yeah i i went i went off to school wanting to either be a high school algebra teacher or high school French teacher because my two favorite people in the in high school were my algebra teacher and French teacher and uh and i was going to do that until the end of our sophomore year when we wanted uh we came time to sign up for majors and i had taken chemistry for the first time that year and surprised myself i did well in it,Declaring a major is a big step.,1,1,True,"step 1: in the premise, the speaker mentions their personal experience of wanting to be an algebra or french teacher during high school, but ultimately deciding to major in chemistry after taking it for the first time. this scenario demonstrates the significance and impact of choosing a major in one's academic career.step 2: the hypothesis expresses a general truth about the decision-making process of declaring a major, implying that it is a substantial and important step. given that the speaker's own experience illustrates this point, the hypothesis can be logically inferred from the premise.step 3: the hypothesis is a common-sense observation about the college experience and aligns with the speaker's personal story, making it a reasonable and expected conclusion from the provided premise."
1697,"CLOs, which should ultimately lead to greater consumer and producer surplus.",CLOs should lead to only instability within the marketplace.,0,0,True,"step 1: in the premise, clos (consumer-led optimization) are described as steps that should ultimately lead to greater consumer and producer surplus. this implies that clos are expected to result in a beneficial outcome for all market participants.step 2: the hypothesis, which states that clos should lead to only instability within the marketplace, contradicts the premise. instability in the marketplace is not a beneficial outcome but rather an undesirable one.step 3: based on the given information, the hypothesis cannot be logically inferred from the premise. the premise indicates a positive outcome, while the hypothesis proposes a negative outcome, making them inconsistent.step 4: it is essential to consider potential contextual factors and underlying assumptions that might influence the relationship between clos and market stability. however, without further context or additional information, it is not possible to make an accurate determination based solely on the given premise and hypothesis."
1698,uh well load up the program again in this case after you load it up change it hope that's right,Do not load up the program at all! ,0,0,True,"step 1: in the premise, there is no clear indication about loading or not loading a program. the action mentioned is 'load it up' which could mean starting or continuing the use of a program. however, it does not necessarily mean loading it for the first time.step 2: the hypothesis directly contradicts the premise as it suggests not loading the program at all, while the premise allows for the possibility of loading it.step 3: given that the hypothesis contradicts the premise, it cannot be logically inferred from it."
1699,"I kept it on me all the time wrapped in my leggings, and I cut her, just a little at the throat.",I wanted to cut the woman but couldn't bring myself to do it.,0,0,True,"step 1: in the premise, there are two distinct actions mentioned - keeping an object on one's body wrapped in leggings and cutting something at the throat. there is no explicit connection between these actions or any mention of a woman. step 2: the hypothesis suggests a desire to cut someone but hesitation in following through with the action. it does not logically follow from the premise as there is no information in the premise about the intent or motivation behind the stated actions. step 3: based on the given information, the hypothesis cannot be logically inferred from the premise."
1700,although i was a Goldwater man and he didn't win,Goldwater won the election!,0,0,True,"step 1: in the premise, the speaker identifies themselves as a 'goldwater man,' indicating they were a supporter of the republican presidential candidate, barry goldwater, during the 1964 election. the second sentence states that 'he didn't win.' this means goldwater lost the election.step 2: the hypothesis, 'goldwater won the election,' directly contradicts the premise. it is not a logical inference from the given premise.step 3: based on the logical analysis, the hypothesis cannot be inferred from the premise."
1701,A young blond woman with braided pigtails and wearing blue biking gear is bicycle racing along a dirt track.,A young blond girl is riding a bike.,1,1,True,"step 1: in the premise, we have several key pieces of information: a young woman, blond hair, braided pigtails, blue biking gear, and bicycle racing. this description implies an active scenario of a woman riding a bike. step 2: the hypothesis 'a young blond girl is riding a bike' is explicitly stated in the premise, so it is a logical consequence of the given information. the hypothesis is a more general version of the premise. therefore, the hypothesis is entailed by the premise. step 3: based on the logical relationship between the premise and hypothesis, and the clear correspondence between the two statements, the hypothesis is a logical consequence of the premise."
1702,"If you're stranded anywhere, hitch-hiking is accepted behavior and you'll surely get a ride.",Hitch-hiking is seen as completely unacceptable behavior.,0,0,True,"step 1: the premise describes a scenario where hitch-hiking is an accepted behavior for those who are stranded. this implies that people are generally willing to stop and offer rides to hitch-hikers in this situation. step 2: the hypothesis states that hitch-hiking is seen as completely unacceptable behavior. this directly contradicts the information provided in the premise. there is no logical connection or common-sense reasoning that can bridge the gap between the premise and hypothesis. step 3: based on the logical inconsistency between the premise and hypothesis, the hypothesis cannot be inferred from the premise."
1703,A smart buyer is one who retains an inhouse staff capable of,A smart buyer has a staff of ten that's inhouse.,1,1,True,"step 1: in the premise, 'a smart buyer' is described as one who 'retains an inhouse staff'. this implies that having an in-house staff is a characteristic or trait of a smart buyer. the term 'inhouse' refers to employees who are directly employed by the organization.step 2: the hypothesis 'a smart buyer has a staff of ten that's inhouse' states that a smart buyer has an in-house staff of ten people. this is consistent with the premise as having an in-house staff is a trait of a smart buyer, and the hypothesis specifies that this staff is in-house.step 3: based on the logical consistency and the meaning of the terms used in both the premise and hypothesis, the hypothesis can be inferred from the premise."
1704,"From Plaza del Caleo, the Gran V?­a continues downhill towards the Plaza de Espa??a through more shopping, strolling, and nightlife territory.","The Gran Va goes downhill towards the Plaza de Espaa, a crime ridden area.",1,0,False,"step 1: in the premise, it is stated that the gran vía continues downhill towards the plaza de españa through shopping, strolling, and nightlife territory. this information provides context about the location and character of the area. the premise does not contain any information about crime in the area.step 2: the hypothesis states that the gran vía goes downhill towards the plaza de españa, a crime-ridden area. although both the premise and hypothesis describe the gran vía going downhill towards plaza de españa, the hypothesis introduces the new information that the area is crime-ridden. there is no logical or factual basis in the premise to support this new information.step 3: based on the given information, the hypothesis cannot be logically inferred from the premise. the premise only describes the location and character of the area in terms of shopping, strolling, and nightlife. it does not contain any information about crime."
1705,of course you could annex Cuba but they wouldn't like that a bit,Annexing Cuba is a great idea.,0,0,True,"step 1: in the premise, it is stated that annexing cuba is a possible action, but it is also acknowledged that the cuban people would not be in favor of it.step 2: the hypothesis, however, goes beyond the premise by expressing a positive evaluation of the idea - 'a great idea'. there is no information in the premise that supports this positive assessment.step 3: based on the given information, the hypothesis is not a logical entailment of the premise. in fact, the premise implies a potential conflict or opposition to the idea of annexation."
1706,"Venice, founded on its islets and lagoons in the sixth century by mainland refugees fleeing Lombard raiders, prospered from a privileged relationship with Byzantium and an uninhibited readiness to trade with Muslims and others farther east.","As a result, Venice opened up new trade routes, and the economy grew.",1,1,True,"step 1: in the premise, we learn that venice was founded in the sixth century and prospered due to a privileged relationship with byzantium and a readiness to trade with the east. this context implies that venice had access to valuable resources and trade opportunities.step 2: the hypothesis asserts that the economy grew as a result of opening up new trade routes. this is a logical inference from the premise, as the premise indicates that venice had a propensity for trading with distant regions, and the growth of the economy is a natural consequence of successful trade.step 3: based on the logical reasoning and common-sense understanding of cause and effect, the hypothesis can be inferred from the premise."
1707,"A remake of the 1957 made-for-TV musical wins praise for its African-American lead and multiracial cast, which includes Jason Alexander, Whitney Houston, and Whoopi Goldberg.","It was a remake of the 1920's drama,The Fast and The Furious. ",0,0,True,"step 1: in the premise, we have information about a remake of a 1957 made-for-tv musical with an african-american lead and multiracial cast, featuring jason alexander, whitney houston, and whoopi goldberg. this context sets the scene for a theatrical production. step 2: the hypothesis, however, suggests a remake of a completely different production - the fast and the furious, which is a 1920's drama. these two pieces of information are not logically related. the fast and the furious is a series of action films that started in the late 1990s, not a 1920's drama. step 3: based on the given context, the hypothesis cannot be logically inferred from the premise. the hypothesis introduces new and contradictory information, as the two productions mentioned are not the same."
1708,Tommy shoved a ticket into my hand and told me to get aboard the cars.,Tommy bought the tickets at a low price from the shady vendor over there.,1,0,False,"step 1: in the premise, tommy actions (shoving a ticket and telling you to get aboard) are indicative of him purchasing a ticket for you. this is a common way for someone to give a ticket to another person. however, the premise does not provide any information about where or how tommy acquired the ticket. step 2: the hypothesis suggests a different context for how tommy obtained the ticket, by buying it from a shady vendor. this is a separate event or cause from the actions described in the premise. step 3: the hypothesis cannot be logically inferred from the premise as the premise does not provide enough information to support the hypothesis. the hypothesis introduces new information that is not entailed by the premise."
1709,yeah i i bought that one and i didn't get into involved in that one as well there's another one he wrote that even sounds better and it's kind of uh the whole concept of global peace you know it's like and communities building communities and uh,"I've read five of his other books, and they're much better.",1,1,True,"step 1: in the premise, the speaker is expressing that they have purchased one book among several written by the same author and did not get deeply involved in it. they also mention that they have read five other books by the same author, which they find to be better. the hypothesis simply states that the speaker has read and found five other books by the same author to be better.step 2: the hypothesis can be logically inferred from the premise as it elaborates on the information provided in the premise. the premise implies that the speaker has a positive opinion of the five other books they have read by the same author, and the hypothesis explicitly states this. the hypothesis does not contradict the premise in any way.step 3: based on the logical reasoning and the absence of contradictory information, the hypothesis is a logical entailment of the premise."
1710,"Streamers flew in my face, dancers diving all around me.",I was in an empty street.,0,0,True,"step 1: in the premise, 'streamers flew in my face' and 'dancers diving all around me' suggest a lively, festive environment, likely a parade or carnival. these actions are inconsistent with being in an empty street. step 2: the hypothesis 'i was in an empty street' contradicts the premise as there is no mention of an empty street and the description of streamers and dancers indicates a crowded scene. no reasonable inference can be made from the premise to the hypothesis. step 3: based on the logical reasoning and the contradiction between the premise and hypothesis, the hypothesis is not entailed by the premise."
1711,yeah yeah i rented the video i thought that was pretty good,I didn't know that the video was out already.,0,1,False,"step 1: in the premise, the speaker is expressing that they rented a video and found it to be good. this statement does not provide any explicit information about when the video was released. step 2: the hypothesis suggests that the speaker did not know that the video was out already. this implies that the speaker thought the video was new to them. step 3: given that the premise does not contradict the hypothesis and the hypothesis is a reasonable assumption based on common language usage (people often express surprise or ignorance when discovering that a media they enjoyed has already been released), the hypothesis can be inferred from the premise.step 4: however, it is important to note that this inference relies on the assumption that the speaker's statement in the premise is truthful. if the speaker was lying or mistaken about having rented the video, then the hypothesis would not be entailed.step 5: overall, the hypothesis is consistent with the information given in the premise and offers a plausible explanation for the speaker's actions and statement."
1712,"In the midst of a final desultory polishing of her silver, Tuppence was disturbed by the ringing of the front door bell, and went to answer it.",Tuppence polishes her silver every day and hates to be disturbed.,1,0,False,"step 1: in the premise, tuppence is described as polishing her silver, which indicates an ongoing activity that she is engaged in. the text does not specify how frequently she performs this task, but it does not contradict the hypothesis that she polishes her silver every day. there is no mention of tuppence expressing a particular feeling about being disturbed.step 2: the hypothesis 'tuppence polishes her silver every day and hates to be disturbed' can be seen as a combination of two separate statements. the first part ('tuppence polishes her silver every day') is not logically entailed by the premise, but it is not contradictory either. the second part ('tuppence hates to be disturbed') is not mentioned in the premise, so it cannot be logically inferred from it. however, the premise does not contradict the hypothesis, as there is no indication that tuppence likes being disturbed or that she only polishes her silver when not disturbed.step 3: based on the information provided, the hypothesis cannot be logically inferred from the premise, but it is also not contradictory. the hypothesis makes an additional assumption about tuppence's feelings towards being disturbed, which is not supported by the given information."
1713,okay sounds good was nice talking to you bye-bye,"Hello, how are you doing today?",0,0,True,"step 1: the premise is a casual greeting and farewell statement, indicating the end of a conversation. it does not contain any factual or logical information. the hypothesis is a common greeting used to initiate a conversation. step 2: the hypothesis cannot be logically inferred from the premise as the hypothesis describes a different situation (initiating a conversation) than the premise (ending a conversation). step 3: based on the lack of logical connection, contradiction, or factual consistency between the premise and hypothesis, the hypothesis is not entailed by the premise."
1714,Persian dance Persian : : رقص ایرانی refers to the dance styles indigenous to Iran.,Persian dance or Iranian dance (Persian:رقص ایرانی) refers to the dance styles indigenous to Iran.,1,1,True,"step 1: in the premise, 'persian dance' is defined as the dance styles indigenous to iran. this definition establishes a clear relationship between 'persian dance' and 'iranian dance.' both terms refer to the same concept.step 2: the hypothesis states the exact same definition, 'persian dance or iranian dance' refers to 'the dance styles indigenous to iran.' this is identical to the definition given in the premise, demonstrating that the hypothesis can be logically inferred from the premise.step 3: based on the logical equivalence between 'persian dance' and 'iranian dance' in both the premise and the hypothesis, the hypothesis can be inferred from the premise."
1715,"When they had slowed, Gauve began the conversation.",Gauve began talking about the invasion when they slowed.,1,0,False,"step 1: the premise establishes a situation where 'they' had slowed, and at that point, gauve initiated a conversation. the context does not provide explicit information about the content of the conversation. however, there is no contradiction or inconsistency in the premise.step 2: the hypothesis suggests a specific topic for the conversation - the invasion. it is plausible that a conversation about an important or significant topic, such as an invasion, may begin when people or parties have slowed down or come to a halt. in many cases, people engage in serious discussions when they have reached a calmer or more stable situation. therefore, the hypothesis is not explicitly stated in the premise but is a reasonable inference based on the context and common sense.step 3: the hypothesis is not directly entailed by the premise, as the premise does not mention the topic of the conversation. however, given the context and common sense understanding, it can be reasonably inferred that the hypothesis is probable."
1716,yes i thought that was a very good movie,I thought it was a terrible film.,0,0,True,"step 1: the premise indicates a positive opinion held by the speaker about a movie. the opinion is expressed with the phrase 'i thought that was a very good movie'.step 2: the hypothesis expresses an opposing opinion about the same movie, stating 'i thought it was a terrible film'. the hypothesis suggests that the speaker holds a negative opinion about the movie.step 3: a negative opinion is not logically inferred from a positive one, given that people can have differing opinions about the same subject matter. therefore, the hypothesis cannot be logically inferred from the premise.step 4: while it's possible for people to change their opinions, the absence of any indication of such a change in the text does not support the inference that the speaker holds both a positive and a negative opinion about the movie at the same time.thus, the hypothesis is not entailed by the premise."
1717,"If Perot successfully woos Buchanan and Ventura convinces Beatty to run, next year's Reform Party nominating convention might be the most entertaining sideshow of the 2000 campaign.",None of the nominees from the Reform Party are qualified to run.,1,0,False,"step 1: in the premise, it is stated that perot, buchanan, ventura, and beatty could potentially be involved in the reform party's nominating convention for the 2000 campaign. no evaluation of their qualifications is mentioned in the premise. step 2: the hypothesis makes a statement about the qualifications of the nominees from the reform party, but no connection or contradiction to the premise can be directly drawn as the premise does not provide enough information about the qualifications of the individuals involved. step 3: based on the given information, it is not possible to logically infer whether the hypothesis is entailed by the premise or not."
1718,view Process establishing an official framework by which designated state planning bodies21 may seek review of LSC reconfiguration decisions.,"An official framework by which designated state planning bodies21, will not seek review of LSC ",0,0,True,"step 1: in the premise, an official framework is established for designated state planning bodies to seek review of lsc reconfiguration decisions. this implies that the framework provides a channel for these bodies to challenge lsc decisions they deem inappropriate.step 2: the hypothesis suggests that designated state planning bodies will not seek review. this directly contradicts the premise, as the premise states that a framework is established for these bodies to do so.step 3: based on the logical analysis, the hypothesis cannot be inferred from the premise as it contradicts the stated information in the premise."
1719,i mean it can you that that just repulsed me and it repulsed everybody that i work with i mean it you know we,It was the most disgusting thing we had ever seen.,1,1,True,"step 1: in the premise, the speaker expresses a strong negative reaction to something they have encountered at their workplace, using the term 'it' to refer to the object or event in question. the use of the word 'repulsed' and the statement that 'everybody' shared this reaction indicates a strong, universally negative assessment of the thing.step 2: the hypothesis makes a quantitative comparison, stating that the thing in question was 'the most disgusting thing we had ever seen'. this is a logical extension of the premise, as the premise sets up the context for a disgusting thing and the hypothesis quantifies the degree of disgust.step 3: based on the logical extension of the premise and the common-sense understanding of strong negative reactions, the hypothesis can be inferred from the premise."
1720,Consider the United States Postal Service.,You might want to use the services of the United States Postal Service.,1,1,True,"step 1: the premise describes the united states postal service (usps). usps is an organization responsible for providing postal services in the united states. it is a common fact that usps offers various services such as mail delivery, package delivery, and other related services.step 2: the hypothesis suggests that one might want to use the services of the usps. this is a reasonable inference from the premise because the premise establishes that the usps exists and provides various services. it is a logical assumption that someone could have a need or desire to use these services.step 3: based on the logical reasoning and common sense, the hypothesis is entailed by the premise as the hypothesis follows logically from the information provided in the premise."
1721,I will wait at our camp in the clearing on the east side of the southern road.,Our camp is set high on a mountain.,0,0,True,"step 1: in the premise, the location of the camp is described as being in a clearing on the east side of the southern road. no specific information about the camp's elevation or proximity to mountains is provided. common sense and logical reasoning do not suggest that a camp being in a clearing necessarily means it is situated on a mountain. step 2: the hypothesis, 'our camp is set high on a mountain,' contradicts the premise as it provides additional information that goes beyond what is stated in the premise. the hypothesis cannot be logically inferred from the premise as it introduces a new fact not present in the premise. step 3: based on the logical analysis and the contradictory nature of the hypothesis with the premise, the hypothesis is not entailed by the premise."
1722,Two members of the Karp Consulting Group (Deborah Howard and Yvonne Shinhoster Lamb) facilitated the two-day session.,Less than five members of the Karp Consulting Group were there to handle the session.,1,0,False,"step 1: in the premise, we have specific mention of deborah howard and yvonne shinhoster lamb from the karp consulting group being present for the two-day session. no other members are explicitly mentioned. commonsense understanding and logical consistency suggest that the presence of these two individuals doesn't inherently exclude other members being present, but it doesn't guarantee that there were less than five. step 2: the hypothesis, 'less than five members of the karp consulting group were there to handle the session', contradicts the premise as it asserts that fewer members were present than what is stated. step 3: based on the given information and logical reasoning, the hypothesis cannot be inferred from the premise as it goes beyond the stated facts."
1724,I began to see the basic flaw in my plan.,I saw that my plan was too ambitious.,1,1,True,"step 1: the premise indicates that the speaker recognized a problem or issue with their plan. the word 'flaw' implies a mistake or error in the plan. 'see' suggests that the speaker gained a clear understanding or perception of this issue. step 2: the hypothesis proposes that the speaker recognized that their plan was too complex or extensive in scope. this is a reasonable interpretation of the premise, as a flaw in a plan could manifest as over-ambition. both the premise and hypothesis describe the speaker's recognition of a problem with their plan. step 3: based on the logical connection between the premise and hypothesis, and the absence of contradictory information, the hypothesis can be inferred from the premise."
1725,um except i don't have a concern too much about the speed however because most of the applications i find are as fast as i am if not more so and i tend to notice it more when it comes down to an issue of peripherals uh at work i'm used to various batch printing capabilities and uh pretty high-speed output either laser printer uh,THe speed doesn't matter because I just use spreadsheets.,1,0,False,"step 1: in the premise, the speaker expresses that they are not overly concerned about the speed of applications they use, as most of them are as fast or faster than they are. they mention their experience with high-speed output devices at work. step 2: in contrast, the hypothesis states that the speed of applications does not matter to the speaker because they only use spreadsheets. while the speaker's lack of concern about speed is mentioned in the premise, it does not directly imply that they only use spreadsheets or that the speed of spreadsheets is irrelevant. step 3: based on the given information, the hypothesis cannot be logically inferred from the premise, as the premise does not provide sufficient evidence to support the hypothesis. the hypothesis might be true, but it's not a necessary conclusion that can be drawn from the premise."
1726,The budget negotiators essentially punted on the issue.,This was too much of a polarizing issue for it to be included here.,1,0,False,"step 1: in the premise, 'essentially punted' implies that the budget negotiators did not address or resolve the issue. it does not provide any information about the nature or content of the issue. 'polarizing issue' refers to a topic or situation that generates strong disagreements and emotions, often making it difficult to find a compromise. step 2: the hypothesis suggests that the issue was too contentious to be addressed, which is consistent with the premise, which states that the negotiators did not include it in the budget. however, the premise does not necessarily imply that the issue was polarizing; it only indicates that the negotiators did not tackle it. the hypothesis goes beyond the given information by making an assumption about the reason for the issue not being included. step 3: although the hypothesis is plausible based on common sense and the context provided, it is not logically entailed by the premise because the premise does not explicitly state that the issue was polarizing."
1727,to uh to transmit the signals to have a backup some to back that that system up so that there is no no down time,The system is down a lot because there is no backup.,0,0,True,"step 1: in the premise, the speaker states that there is a system in place to prevent down time by transmitting signals and having a backup. this implies that the system is important and that there is an awareness of the need to prevent downtime.step 2: the hypothesis suggests that the reason for the system's down time is the lack of a backup. this contradicts the premise because the premise states that there is a backup system.step 3: based on the logical negation of the hypothesis with respect to the premise, the hypothesis is not entailed by the premise."
1728,"As a cavalry brigadier, he was captured in 1808 and held until 1812.","As a cavalry brigadier, he participated in the 1807 Invasion of Portugal but was captured in 1808 and held until 1812.",1,1,True,"step 1: in the premise, we have information about the individual being a cavalry brigadier, his capture in 1808, and his release in 1812. the hypothesis provides an additional detail about his participation in the 1807 invasion of portugal before his capture. step 2: this additional detail in the hypothesis is consistent with the premise since there is no contradiction between being a cavalry brigadier and participating in military actions, including the invasion of portugal. moreover, the timeline in the hypothesis fits with the premise, as his capture occurred in the same year (1808) mentioned in the premise. step 3: given the logical consistency and factual compatibility between the premise and hypothesis, it can be inferred that if the premise is true, then the hypothesis is also true. the hypothesis is a more detailed version of the premise and does not contradict it in any way. therefore, the hypothesis can be logically inferred from the premise."
1729,"During the fifth century a number of Celtic tribes came together to form the Kingdom of Rheged, which is said to have stretched north over what is now the Scottish border and south as far as the River Mersey.",It was also during the fifth century that Germans rules the northern isles.,1,0,False,"step 1. in the premise, we have the formation of the kingdom of rheged in the fifth century and its geographical extent. no information is provided about any german rule in the region during that time.step 2. the hypothesis suggests that germans ruled the northern isles during the fifth century, which is distinct from the establishment of the kingdom of rheged.step 3. the hypothesis cannot be logically inferred from the premise as there is no common information or logical connection between the two statements. the premise does not imply or suggest german rule in the northern isles during the fifth century.step 4. it is possible for both statements to be true, but the hypothesis is not a logical consequence of the premise."
1730,There are several old lands found down the narrow wynds leading off the main street.,The main street has over 20narrown wynds leading off of it.,1,0,False,"step 1: in the premise, 'several old lands' are mentioned as being found 'down the narrow wynds' leading off the main street. this suggests that there are multiple narrow passages or alleys that branch off the main street and lead to older areas or buildings. step 2: the hypothesis 'the main street has over 20 narrow wynds leading off of it' goes beyond what is stated in the premise, as it specifies an exact number of 'narrow wynds'. however, the hypothesis is not contradictory to the premise, as the premise does not provide a definitive number of 'narrow wynds' and the hypothesis is within a reasonable range given the context. step 3: while the hypothesis cannot be logically inferred from the premise as it provides additional information, it is not contradictory and could be a reasonable assumption based on the context. the premise describes several old lands being found through narrow wynds, and it is within reason that there could be over 20 of these narrow passages leading off the main street. the premise does not contradict the hypothesis, and there is no contradictory evidence provided.step 4: in natural language processing, it is important to distinguish between logical entailment and reasonable assumption or inference. in this case, the hypothesis is a reasonable assumption based on the context, but it is not logically entailed by the premise."
1731,Historical heritage is very much the theme at Ichidani.,Ichidani's heritage is not important. ,0,0,True,"step 1: in the premise, 'historical heritage is very much the theme at ichidani,' the statement suggests that ichidani places a significant emphasis on preserving and celebrating its historical heritage. step 2: the hypothesis, 'ichidani's heritage is not important,' contradicts the premise. since the premise states that historical heritage is a major theme at ichidani, the hypothesis that ichidani's heritage is unimportant is not logically entailed. step 3: based on the logical contradiction between the premise and hypothesis, the hypothesis cannot be inferred from the premise."
1732,"At the Richard Nixon Library and Birthplace,(18001Yorba Linda Bvd. , Yorba Linda), the life of the 37th president of the United States who died in 1994 is showcased in amazing detail.",Nixon passed away in 2015.,0,0,True,"step 1: in the premise, it is stated that richard nixon, the 37th president of the united states who died in 1994, is showcased at the nixon library and birthplace. the premise provides factual information about nixon's life and the location where his life is displayed. step 2: the hypothesis states that nixon passed away in 2015. however, this is a clear contradiction to the factual information stated in the premise, as nixon died in 1994, not in 2015. step 3: based on the contradictory information in the hypothesis and the factual information in the premise, the hypothesis cannot be logically inferred from the premise."
1733,"Meanwhile, the other eight slave states, with little cotton production, remained in the Union.","Meanwhile, the other eight slave states, with little or no cotton production, remained in the Union.",1,1,True,"step 1: in the premise, it is mentioned that 'the other eight slave states, with little cotton production, remained in the union'. this indicates that there were eight states in the union that had minimal cotton production and were also slave states.step 2: the hypothesis is similar to the premise, with the addition of 'or no' before 'cotton production'. this suggests that the hypothesis is implying the same scenario as the premise but with a minor change in the quantification of cotton production.step 3: since the hypothesis does not contradict the premise and is a logical consequence of it (given that 'little cotton production' can be interpreted as 'little or no cotton production'), the hypothesis can be inferred from the premise.step 4: in summary, the hypothesis is logically entailed by the premise as it is a more specific instance of the scenario described in the premise."
1734,"Individual and often uncontrollable circumstances have resulted in nearly all facility engineering functions, from conceptual planning to project startup, being contracted to outside consultants at one time or another.","Uncontrollable situations have been negative experiences, but leads to other things. ",1,0,False,"step 1: in the premise, it is stated that individual and often uncontrollable circumstances have led to the outsourcing of facility engineering functions. this implies that there are situations beyond the control of the facility that necessitate the hiring of outside consultants. the hypothesis suggests that these uncontrollable situations have had negative consequences, but have also led to other things.step 2: the hypothesis does not directly contradict the premise. the negative experiences referred to in the hypothesis could be the additional costs, delays, or other issues that often come with outsourcing. however, the hypothesis also implies that there are positive outcomes from these uncontrollable situations. while the premise does not explicitly mention these positive outcomes, it does not contradict them either.step 3: the hypothesis is not logically entailed by the premise, as the premise does not provide enough information to deduce the existence of positive outcomes from the negative experiences. however, the hypothesis does not contradict the premise, and the premise leaves open the possibility of positive outcomes. therefore, the hypothesis is not entailed by the premise, but it is not in conflict with it either."
1735,yeah i'm in Dallas and they're long here too so,"I'm in Dallas, but they are long gone.",0,0,True,"step 1: the premise establishes that 'i' am in dallas. it does not provide any information about 'they' or their current presence or absence. step 2: the hypothesis states that 'i' am still in dallas, but 'they' are long gone. this hypothesis contradicts the information in the premise as 'they' are not mentioned in the premise. step 3: based on the logical analysis, the hypothesis cannot be inferred from the premise as it contradicts the information provided in the premise."
1736,The band 's varied musical style have influences rooted in punk rock.,The band's varied musical style have influences rooted in punk rock and heavy metal.,1,1,True,"step 1: in the premise, it is stated that the band's musical style has influences rooted in punk rock. this means that some elements of their music can be traced back to the punk rock genre. step 2: the hypothesis suggests that the band's musical style also has influences from heavy metal. while punk rock and heavy metal are distinct genres, they do share some similarities, such as energetic and powerful sounds. it is common for bands to blend elements from multiple genres to create a unique sound. step 3: given the information from steps 1 and 2, it is reasonable to infer that the band's musical style having influences from both punk rock and heavy metal is a logical extension of the premise. the presence of punk rock influences does not exclude the possibility of heavy metal influences. in fact, the two genres can complement each other in creating a varied musical style. step 4: therefore, based on the logical reasoning and common sense, the hypothesis can be inferred from the premise."
1737,A very young child in a red plaid coat and pink winter hat makes a snowball in a large pile of snow., A very young child in a red plaid coat and pink winter hat makes a snowball.,1,1,True,"step 1: in the premise, there is a description of a very young child making a snowball in the snow. the child is identified by the specific clothing items - red plaid coat and pink winter hat. step 2: the hypothesis also describes the same very young child making a snowball, with the same identifying clothing items. this means that the subject of both the premise and hypothesis are the same. step 3: making a snowball is an action that is both explicitly stated in the premise and implied in the hypothesis. therefore, the hypothesis can be logically inferred from the premise as it describes a continuation or repetition of the action stated in the premise. step 4: there are no contradictory facts or logical inconsistencies between the premise and hypothesis. step 5: based on the logical equivalence between the premise and hypothesis, and the lack of contradictory facts, the hypothesis is entailed by the premise."
1738,She becomes familiar with people who have been in court over and over.,"These people are mostly lawyer, judges, and police officers.",1,0,False,"step 1: in the premise, 'she becomes familiar with people who have been in court over and over.' the key information is that these people have frequent court appearances. no specific occupations are mentioned. step 2: the hypothesis 'these people are mostly lawyer, judges, and police officers' provides additional details about the people in question, suggesting that they hold certain professional roles within the legal system. step 3: although the premise does not directly entail the hypothesis, the occupations mentioned in the hypothesis are reasonable possibilities given the context of frequent court appearances. it is common sense that lawyers, judges, and police officers often interact with the legal system, making their presence in a court setting plausible. therefore, while not logically entailed, the hypothesis is a reasonable inference based on the given context."
1739,i think i've seen most of Humphrey Bogart's movies but in in you know a long time ago and uh like the Maltese Falcon and all those uh,I never saw Bogart's movies.,0,0,True,"step 1: the premise describes the speaker's belief about having seen most of humphrey bogart's movies and mentioning specific films like 'the maltese falcon'. step 2: the hypothesis asserts the opposite claim, stating that the speaker has never seen bogart's movies. given the information in the premise, this contradicts the speaker's stated belief. step 3: based on the given information, the hypothesis cannot be logically inferred from the premise, as they are contradictory statements."
1740,so but redemption centers are a big thing up here they get a penny a can they handle they give you five cents and the when they return the can to the distributor i think they either get a penny or two pennies a can,The centers don't get anything for the cans.,0,0,True,"step 1: in the premise, it is mentioned that redemption centers get a penny or two pennies per can when they return it to the distributor. this implies that they make a profit from the cans. step 2: the hypothesis states that they don't get anything for the cans, which directly contradicts the information provided in the premise. step 3: based on the contradictory nature of the hypothesis and the premise, the hypothesis cannot be logically inferred from the premise."
1741,"Probably, I thought, it really never happened. ",It was too far-fetched to believe it actually happened.,1,0,False,"step 1: in the premise, the speaker expresses doubt about the occurrence of an event. the use of the word 'probably' indicates uncertainty. no specific details about the event are given. in the hypothesis, the idea is that the event described in the premise was implausible. step 2: the hypothesis is logically consistent with the premise, as the premise leaves open the possibility that the event did not occur. the hypothesis goes a step further and asserts that the event was unlikely to have occurred. step 3: based on the given information, the hypothesis can be seen as a reasonable conclusion, as it is consistent with the uncertainty expressed in the premise. step 4: however, the premise does not entail the hypothesis, as the hypothesis makes an additional assumption about the implausibility of the event. therefore, while the hypothesis is a reasonable conclusion, it is not logically entailed by the premise."
1742,well good afternoon to you Mary first let me ask you what's what's the weather like up there to begin with,The conversation started off with a discussion about politics.,0,0,True,"step 1: the premise describes the beginning of a conversation between two individuals, with the first speaker asking about the weather. the weather is a common topic for small talk and does not necessarily indicate the conversation's content.step 2: the hypothesis suggests that the conversation started with a discussion about politics. this topic is not mentioned in the premise, and there is no evidence to suggest that politics was the first topic of conversation.step 3: based on the available information, the hypothesis is not logically inferred from the premise. the absence of any mention of politics in the premise does not contradict the hypothesis, but it also does not support it. the lack of explicit evidence in the premise to support the hypothesis results in a 'no entailment' conclusion."
1743,"I took that as a polite dismissal, and worked my way out of the cockpit just as the train began to move again.","I took that as him telling me to leave, so I walked out of the cockpit like he asked.",1,1,True,"step 1: in the premise, the speaker states that they took someone's comment as a polite dismissal and left the cockpit as the train began to move again. this implies that the speaker felt unwelcome or that it was time for them to go. the hypothesis suggests that the speaker left after being told to do so. step 2: the hypothesis is consistent with the information in the premise, as both suggest that the speaker left the cockpit. step 3: the hypothesis can be logically inferred from the premise, as the premise implies that the speaker left in response to a comment that they interpreted as a request or expectation for them to leave. therefore, the hypothesis is entailed by the premise.

1744,Susan smiled and went to the boys.,Susan went to the boys to ask them a question.,1,0,False,"step 1: the premise states that susan smiled and went to the boys. smiling is often a sign of friendliness or positivity, but it does not necessarily imply that susan was asking a question. going to the boys could mean various things, such as giving them an instruction, playing with them, or just talking to them. however, there's no contradictory information in the premise that would make it impossible for susan to have asked a question.step 2: the hypothesis suggests that susan went to the boys to ask them a question. this is a possible explanation for her actions, but it's not the only one. the hypothesis is not directly entailed by the premise because the premise does not explicitly state that susan asked a question.step 3: based on the given information, the hypothesis is not entailed by the premise. however, it's important to note that the premise does not rule out the possibility of susan asking a question, either. the hypothesis is simply a more specific explanation for susan's actions, but it's not the only plausible one."
1745,"Rushing out of the cockpit for a final time, I found the nearest site of battle.","I didn't want to, but I decided to leave the cockpit again. ",1,0,False,"step 1: in the premise, the speaker rushes out of the cockpit for the 'final time,' indicating that this is the last instance of leaving the cockpit in the given context. however, the premise does not explicitly state why the speaker leaves the cockpit or whether they wanted to leave or not. the hypothesis suggests that the speaker didn't want to leave but still did.step 2: the hypothesis does not directly contradict the premise as leaving the cockpit is not necessarily an action that is incompatible with the premise. however, the hypothesis does add new information not explicitly stated in the premise, which is the speaker's reluctance to leave.step 3: based on the given information, the hypothesis cannot be logically inferred from the premise because the premise does not provide enough detail to definitively conclude that the speaker didn't want to leave. it is possible for someone to reluctantly leave a cockpit in the same manner described in the premise. hence, while not contradictory, the hypothesis is not entailed by the premise."
1746,and there's just so many people and so many accidents every single day that it take another police force just to answer the traffic,I'd rather they didn't increase their police force size.,1,0,False,"step 1. in the premise, it is stated that there are many people and many accidents every day, implying a high demand for police presence to handle traffic. step 2. the hypothesis suggests a preference for no increase in police force size. this statement does not logically follow from the premise as there is no indication in the premise that increasing the police force size is being considered or that it would address the issues of traffic or accidents. step 3. based on the given information, the hypothesis cannot be logically inferred from the premise."
1748,"The House of Cleopatra is also worthy of note, named for the lady of the house who left behind headless statues of herself and her husband, Dioskourides.",Cleopatra left behind complete statues. ,0,0,True,"step 1: in the premise, cleopatra is identified as the lady of the house of cleopatra and it is mentioned that she left behind headless statues of herself and her husband. step 2: the hypothesis suggests that cleopatra left behind complete statues, which contradicts the information provided in the premise. cleopatra leaving behind complete statues is not logically inferred from the premise. step 3: based on the information provided, it appears that the hypothesis contradicts the premise, and therefore, it cannot be logically inferred from the premise."
1750,Most of the resorts on the Strip have appeased family visitors by cleaning up their shows and covering up the showgirls.,Families became outraged when visiting resorts that openly showed nudity during their shows.,1,1,True,"step 1: in the premise, it is mentioned that most resorts on the strip have changed their shows to accommodate family visitors by cleaning them up and covering up the showgirls. this indicates that there was a previous state where these shows were more explicit and potentially offensive to families. step 2: the hypothesis suggests that families were outraged when they encountered such open nudity during their visits to the resorts. this is a reasonable inference from the premise since it is stated that the resorts made changes to avoid such reactions. step 3: based on the logical reasoning, it can be inferred that the hypothesis is entailed by the premise. the premise sets the context of families being offended by explicit shows, and the hypothesis describes their reaction to such shows in the past."
1751, 9th circa b.c.First signs of pre-Roman Etruscans,We haven't learned anything about the pre-Roman Etruscans.,0,0,True,"step 1: the premise describes the first signs of the pre-roman etruscan civilization. this means that there is historical evidence or records of their existence. step 2: the hypothesis states that we haven't learned anything about the pre-roman etruscans. this suggests a lack of knowledge or information. step 3: the hypothesis contradicts the premise because the premise asserts the existence of information about the pre-roman etruscans, while the hypothesis denies this. step 4: based on the logical contradiction between the premise and hypothesis, the hypothesis is not entailed by the premise.step 5: it is important to note that the absence of evidence for a certain claim does not prove the claim to be false. the hypothesis only states that we haven't learned anything about the pre-roman etruscans, not that there is no information to be found. however, based on the information given in the premise, the hypothesis is clearly not entailed."
1752,It's got an Elizabethan flavour about it makes one think of galleons and doubloons.,The restaurant has an Elizabethan flavour.,1,1,True,"step 1: the premise describes a feeling or impression that the speaker gets when thinking about a certain place, using the phrase 'elizabethan flavor' which is associated with things related to the elizabethan era such as galleons and doubloons. this era is known for its grandeur, ornateness and opulence. step 2: the hypothesis suggests that the restaurant shares this 'elizabethan flavor'. given that the premise is based on a sensory or impressionistic experience, it is reasonable to infer that the restaurant also exhibits the same qualities that evoke the elizabethan era in the speaker's mind. step 3: based on the given information and the logical principle of modus ponens (if p then q, p is true, therefore q is true), the hypothesis can be inferred from the premise."
1753,"(The bad news in this case would apparently be for Collins' new mother-in-law, who had to make do with a standard $280 room.)",Collin does not have a new mother in law.,0,0,True,"step 1: in the premise, it mentions that collins' new mother-in-law had to make do with a standard $280 room. this implies that collins has recently married, and his mother-in-law exists. step 2: the hypothesis states that collins does not have a new mother-in-law, which directly contradicts the information in the premise. therefore, the hypothesis cannot be logically inferred from the premise. step 3: based on the contradiction between the premise and hypothesis, the hypothesis is not entailed by the premise."
1754,all right what do you think about it like well you can go first,Do you think that it's good?,1,1,True,"step 1: in the premise, 'all' and 'you' are mentioned, implying a conversation between two or more entities. the question 'what do you think about it' is a request for an opinion. 'it' is the subject of the conversation, but its meaning is unclear from the provided context. 'like' functions as a coordinating conjunction, indicating a comparison or similarity between the premise and the hypothesis. step 2: the hypothesis also expresses a request for an opinion, using the word 'good'. since both the premise and hypothesis are asking for opinions about 'it', they share a common structure and subject. step 3: based on this logical and semantic similarity, the hypothesis can be inferred from the premise as a potential response to the same question or topic.step 4: it's important to note that the actual content of the opinions expressed in the premise and hypothesis might not match, as the word 'good' has multiple meanings and interpretations. this inference only establishes that the hypothesis is a valid response to the same question or topic as the premise, not that the opinions are identical.step 5: in real-world conversations, people often respond to the same question with different opinions, so this inference is a common and valid one.step 6: in summary, the hypothesis can be logically inferred from the premise based on their similar semantic structure and shared subject, even though the opinions they express might not be identical."
1755,"Chronic Exposure, Ages 30 and older PM2.",It is a study of chronic exposure to radioactive materials.,1,1,True,"step 1: in the premise, 'chronic exposure, ages 30 and older' refers to a group of individuals who have been exposed to a particular substance or condition for a long period of time. the term 'chronic' implies long-term or persistent exposure. no specific information about the nature of the exposure is given. however, the context suggests that this is a research study or report. in science, 'chronic exposure' is often used when talking about the health effects of long-term contact with certain substances, including environmental pollutants and industrial chemicals, including radioactive materials. step 2: the hypothesis, 'it is a study of chronic exposure to radioactive materials', is consistent with the information in the premise. it specifies the nature of the chronic exposure, making it a more precise description of the study's subject matter. the hypothesis can be logically inferred from the premise as it provides a clearer definition of the subject of the study. step 3: based on the logical connections, the common sense understanding of the terms used in the premise, and the fact that 'chronic exposure to radioactive materials' is a valid scientific research topic, the hypothesis can be inferred from the premise."
1756,"Citizens are not able to access these reports online, even though they are electronically stored.",The reports are widely available online.,0,0,True,"step 1: in the premise, it is stated that citizens cannot access the reports online, despite them being electronically stored. this implies that there is a barrier preventing access. step 2: the hypothesis suggests that the reports are widely available online, which directly contradicts the premise. if the reports were indeed widely available online, then the premise would not hold true. step 3: based on the contradiction between the premise and hypothesis, it can be concluded that the hypothesis is not entailed by the premise."
1757,by 1996 ; most of the aforementioned artists departed from the label after the death of 2Pac.,"Death Row Records was making $100,000,000 a year, but by 1996; most of the aforementioned artists departed from the label after the death of 2Pac.",1,0,False,"step 1: in the premise, it is mentioned that most of the aforementioned artists left death row records after the death of 2pac by 1996. no specific information is given about the financial status of death row records during that time. step 2: the hypothesis adds additional information about death row records making $100,000,000 a year but does not contradict the premise. however, there is no factual basis or logical connection between the artists' departures and the record label's financial status. step 3: based on the given information, the hypothesis cannot be logically inferred from the premise, as it provides an unrelated detail."
1758,"The village consists of four parts, High Ackworth, Low Ackworth, Ackworth Moor Top, and Brackenhill.","The village consists of four parts, High Ackworth, Low Ackworth, Ackworth Moor Top, and Banner Children 's.",0,0,True,"step 1: in the premise, the village is identified as having four parts named high ackworth, low ackworth, ackworth moor top, and brackenhill. no logical connections or commonsense understanding suggest that these names are incorrect or that there are additional parts.step 2: the hypothesis states that the village consists of four parts, with the same three names as the premise, but the fourth part is named banner children 's instead of brackenhill. this hypothesis contradicts the premise if we assume that the names of the parts are unique and unchangeable within the context. however, it's important to note that a simple name change doesn't necessarily contradict the premise.step 3: to determine if the hypothesis can be inferred from the premise, we need to consider if there is any logical or factual basis for assuming that 'banner children 's' could be a valid replacement for 'brackenhill'. without further information, there doesn't seem to be any reason to believe that this is the case. therefore, we cannot logically infer the hypothesis from the premise.step 4: based on the given information, there is no entailment between the premise and the hypothesis."
1759,"If doctors start using computer interviews as an excuse to talk to patients less, medical care will deteriorate.",There are some doctors who would love to spend less time talking to patients.,1,0,False,"step 1: in the premise, it is suggested that doctors' use of computer interviews could lead to less direct patient interaction, potentially resulting in a deterioration of medical care. this implies a causal relationship between reduced doctor-patient interaction and medical care quality. step 2: the hypothesis states that there are some doctors who would prefer to spend less time talking to patients. this is not a logical contradiction of the premise, as it is consistent with the possibility that some doctors' use of computer interviews could lead to reduced patient interaction. step 3: the hypothesis does not logically follow from the premise, as it does not establish a causal link between doctors' desire to spend less time with patients and the deterioration of medical care. the premise only suggests a possible causal relationship, and the hypothesis presents a separate fact about some doctors' preferences. therefore, the hypothesis is not entailed by the premise."
1760,Gold studied theatre at the New World School of the Arts and at Emerson College.,"Gold grew up in Miami, Florida and studied theatre at the New World School of the Arts and at Emerson College.",1,0,False,"step 1: in the premise, gold is stated to have studied theatre at the new world school of the arts and at emerson college. no information is provided about where gold grew up. step 2: the hypothesis adds that gold grew up in miami, florida. this information does not contradict the premise, as studying theatre at new world school of the arts and emerson college does not require gold to have grown up in miami. however, the hypothesis is not logically required or entailed by the premise. step 3: based on the information provided, the hypothesis is not entailed by the premise."
1761,"To do this, it should ensure that its acquisition process captures specific design and manufacturing knowledge, includes decisions at key junctures in the development program, and provides incentives to use a knowledge-based process.",The knowledge-based process offers significant cost savings over other approaches.,1,0,False,"step 1: in the premise, it is stated that the knowledge-based process should capture specific design and manufacturing knowledge, include decisions at key junctures, and provide incentives to use this process. this implies that the knowledge-based process is a systematic and well-planned approach that incorporates expert knowledge and decision-making at various stages.step 2: the hypothesis suggests that the knowledge-based process offers significant cost savings over other approaches. while the premise doesn't explicitly state this, it doesn't contradict the hypothesis either. in fact, the use of a knowledge-based process could potentially lead to cost savings by reducing errors, increasing efficiency, and facilitating reuse of expertise and knowledge.step 3: based on the logical reasoning, there isn't enough information in the premise to definitively prove or disprove the hypothesis. however, the premise doesn't contradict the hypothesis, and there are potential benefits of using a knowledge-based process (as stated in the premise) that could contribute to cost savings. therefore, the hypothesis isn't necessarily entailed by the premise, but it's not contradictory either.step 4: it's important to note that the premise and hypothesis describe different aspects of the knowledge-based process. the premise focuses on the process's characteristics and requirements, while the hypothesis makes a claim about its cost effectiveness. while the premise doesn't directly address the cost savings, it doesn't contradict the hypothesis either."
1762,it really is it it's sad to think that we would do that to people and you know i've seen them on TV with uh bed sores and,It's a good thing that we did that to those people.,0,0,True,"step 1: in the premise, the speaker expresses sadness about the idea of mistreating people and describes seeing such mistreatment on tv, specifically mentioning bed sores. this suggests a scenario where people are being neglected or mistreated in some way.step 2: the hypothesis states that it's a good thing that we did that to those people. this is a direct contradiction of the premise, as the premise expresses sadness for the mistreatment of people, while the hypothesis expresses approval or indifference to it.step 3: based on the information provided, the hypothesis cannot be logically inferred from the premise as they contradict each other.step 4: it is important to note that ethical considerations and common sense reasoning also support this conclusion. the premise expresses a negative sentiment towards the mistreatment of people, and the hypothesis, if true, would represent a violation of moral and ethical principles. therefore, it is not valid to infer the hypothesis from the premise."
1763,He hit .300 or better in 10 of the 12 years he played.,He hit.301 or better in 10 of the 12 years he played.,1,0,False,"step 1: in the premise, it is stated that the player hit .300 or better in ten out of twelve years he played. this means that the player had a batting average of at least .300 in ten of those years. step 2: the hypothesis suggests that instead of hitting .300 or better, the player hit .301 or better in ten of the twelve years he played. this is a stronger condition than the premise. although the difference is small, it is still a difference. however, the hypothesis does not contradict the premise as it is still within the realm of possibility that the player met both conditions (hit .300 or better in ten years and hit .301 or better in ten years). step 3: the hypothesis can be seen as a more specific or stricter version of the premise. while it cannot be logically inferred from the premise alone, it does not contradict the premise either. however, without additional information about the player's performance in each of those years, it is impossible to definitively say whether the hypothesis is true or not."
1764,i've never heard of such of thing this is this is really a surprise to me i wasn't total i'm glad it was you because i was afraid i'd get some guy on here that knows all about this,That doesn't shock me at all; that's easy.,0,0,True,"step 1: in the premise, the speaker expresses surprise and gladness about not knowing something. this suggests a lack of prior knowledge or expectation about the topic. in contrast, the hypothesis expresses a lack of shock or surprise about the same topic.step 2: the hypothesis does not contradict the premise, but rather it presents a different emotional response to the same situation. it is possible to be unsurprised or even expectant about something that is a surprise to others. thus, the hypothesis does not logically follow from the premise, but it is consistent with it.step 3: based on the given information, the hypothesis is not entailed by the premise. the premise and hypothesis describe different emotional responses to the same situation, and one does not logically follow from the other."
1766,"In keeping with other early Buddhist tenets, there is no figurative representation of Buddha here, However, there is a large gilded statue from a later period inside, and behind the temple are the spreading branches and trunks of the sacred Bodhi Tree, which is said to have grown from a sapling of the first one that stood here 2,500 years ago.",There are several figurative representations of Buddha located there.,0,0,True,"step 1: the premise states that there is no figurative representation of buddha present at the temple based on early buddhist tenets. it also mentions the existence of a large gilded statue from a later period and the sacred bodhi tree. step 2: the hypothesis contradicts the premise by stating that there are several figurative representations of buddha present at the temple. step 3: based on the information given, the hypothesis cannot be logically inferred from the premise as it goes against the stated fact that there are no figurative representations of buddha according to the premise."
1767,oh well she she doesn't have to worry about public schools yet,The public schools are something she has to worry about now.,0,0,True,"step 1: in the premise, it is stated that 'she doesn't have to worry about public schools yet.' this implies that there is a point in time when 'she' will have to worry about public schools. the hypothesis suggests that 'the public schools are something she has to worry about now.' which contradicts the premise since 'now' is the present and 'she' is currently not worried about public schools according to the premise. step 2: based on this contradiction, it is clear that the hypothesis cannot be logically inferred from the premise. step 3: the hypothesis directly contradicts the premise, making it an incorrect conclusion."
1768,Submission of Report,Report of Submission,0,1,False,"step 1. the premise 'submission of report' refers to an action where a report is formally handed over or submitted to a recipient. this can be inferred from the common meaning of the term 'submission'. the verb 'submit' implies an act of presenting something for consideration or review. there is no contradictory information in the premise.step 2. the hypothesis 'report of submission' is logically equivalent to the premise. both phrases denote a report being presented or handed over. they convey the same meaning.step 3. based on the logical equivalence of the premise and hypothesis, the hypothesis is entailed by the premise."
1769,"Well, I don't want to hustle you any, Jane, but there's no sense in waiting about.",There were other things that needed to be done. ,1,1,True,"step 1: in the premise, 'there's no sense in waiting about' indicates a sense of urgency or importance in doing something. 'waiting about' could mean waiting for an opportunity or for someone. the phrase 'but i don't want to hustle you, jane' implies respect for jane's time, suggesting that the speaker values her time and does not wish to waste it. this does not contradict the hypothesis. step 2: the hypothesis can be inferred from the premise because the urgency or importance of doing things implies that there are other things that need to be done. this is a common sense reasoning, as when one senses the need to act, it often implies that there are multiple tasks or responsibilities that need attention. step 3: based on the logical reasoning and common sense, the hypothesis is a logical inference from the premise."
1770,"General Accounting Office, Managing For  Using Strategic Human Capital Management to Drive Transformational Change, GAO-02-940T(Washington, D.C.: July 15, 2002 ).",Transformation change works best when all avenues are explored.,1,0,False,"step 1. the premise is a report from the general accounting office (gao) titled 'managing for results: using strategic human capital management to drive transformational change'. it provides insights and recommendations for effective human capital management in driving organizational change. step 2. the hypothesis, 'transformation change works best when all avenues are explored', is a general principle of problem-solving and decision-making. it implies that considering multiple options and solutions thoroughly results in the best possible outcome. step 3. the hypothesis is not a direct inference from the premise as the premise does not specifically mention the exploration of all avenues. however, the recommendation of strategic human capital management in the premise does imply a thoughtful and thorough approach to managing change. the hypothesis can be considered a logical extension or implication of the strategic approach to change management described in the premise. step 4. while not a direct inference, the hypothesis is consistent with the principles and recommendations suggested in the premise and is a sound approach to managing transformational change. step 5. in conclusion, the hypothesis is a logical extension of the premise and a sound principle for managing transformational change, though not a direct inference."
1771,Shrink Rap,Psychiatrist Singing Opera songs,0,0,True,"step 1. the premise 'shrink rap' does not provide sufficient information to infer anything about a psychiatrist singing opera songs. 'shrink rap' is a term often used to refer to therapeutic rap music or a therapeutic approach using rap music. it does not mention a psychiatrist or opera singing.step 2. the hypothesis 'psychiatrist singing opera songs' cannot be logically inferred from the premise 'shrink rap' as there is no connection between the two. the hypothesis introduces new information not present in the premise.step 3. based on the given information, the hypothesis is not entailed by the premise."
1772,to the answering service at the office,to the project management team at the office.,0,0,True,"step 1: the premise refers to an action or location ('to the answering service at the office'). the hypothesis also refers to an action or location ('to the project management team at the office'), both of which are situated at 'the office'. step 2: the hypothesis does not logically follow from the premise as they refer to different groups within the office. answering services and project management teams are distinct entities in an office setting. step 3: based on the information given, the hypothesis is not entailed by the premise."
1773,well um i'll tell you something um i i have a sister-in-law from Israel,I have a sister-in-law from Jamaica.,0,0,True,"step 1: in the premise, the speaker mentions having a sister-in-law from israel. this is a factual statement about the speaker's family background. step 2: the hypothesis suggests a different nationality for the sister-in-law, which contradicts the premise. the statements in the premise and hypothesis cannot be logically inferred from each other as they are inconsistent. step 3: based on the logical reasoning, the hypothesis cannot be inferred from the premise."
1774,It was here that St. Denis was martyred (see page 13) and where St. Ignatius Loyola launched the Jesuit movement in 1534.,The Jesuit movement was launched in 1990.,0,0,True,"step 1. in the premise, st. denis is mentioned as having been martyred at a specific location, and st. ignatius loyola is stated as having launched the jesuit movement in the same location in a particular year (1534). step 2. the hypothesis presents a year for the launch of the jesuit movement that is significantly different from the year provided in the premise. step 3. the hypothesis cannot be logically inferred from the premise because the premise does not provide any information that supports or suggests the launch of the jesuit movement in 1990. in fact, the premise explicitly states the year as 1534."
1775,"But as a working fishing port with an attractive seafront, long promenade, and restored 17th-century Saint-Jacques quarter, the town is worth a visit in its own right.",There is a nice bed and breakfast by the water for those who want to stay over night.,1,1,True,"step 1: the premise describes the town as having a working fishing port, an attractive seafront, a long promenade, and a restored 17th-century saint-jacques quarter, implying that it is an interesting and appealing place to visit. step 2: the hypothesis suggests that there is a nice bed and breakfast by the water in this town. this is a reasonable inference from the premise because it is common for attractive and interesting towns to have various accommodations for tourists, including bed and breakfasts. step 3: based on the logical reasoning, common sense, and the lack of contradictory information, the hypothesis can be inferred from the premise.step 4: additionally, the presence of a working fishing port and attractive seafront implies the availability of accommodations for tourists, as such amenities are often associated with tourist-friendly towns.therefore, the hypothesis is a logical consequence of the premise."
1776,but they don't look you know like she had complained about it one time and the girl said she was sorry she picked up these utensils and and when back and grabbed some new ones and then put the new ones back down and the new ones looked worse than the ones that she took away so she is not even looking you know and,She wanted to complain to management about the cutlery.,1,0,False,"step 1: in the premise, a girl had complained about some utensils to another person, and upon replacing them with new ones, she found that the new ones looked worse. the girl then did not express any further concern or action towards the new utensils.step 2: the hypothesis suggests that the girl's initial complaint and her subsequent actions were indicative of her intent to complain to management about the cutlery. while it is possible that her earlier behavior could suggest this intention, it is not a logical necessity. the premise does not explicitly state that the girl's goal was to complain to management.step 3: based on the given information, it is not logically entailed that the hypothesis is true. the premise does not definitively prove that the girl's actions were driven by the intention to complain to management. the hypothesis goes beyond the information provided in the premise."
1777,"The stuff of a novel, but don't expect the 37-year-old Roy to write it.",Roy didn't have enough fingers on his hands to write a novel.,1,0,False,"step 1: in the premise, 'the stuff of a novel' refers to a literary work, and the statement 'but don't expect roy to write it' indicates that roy is unlikely or unable to write such a work. the reason for this is not explicitly stated but can be inferred. it doesn't directly relate to having enough fingers.step 2: the hypothesis, 'roy didn't have enough fingers on his hands to write a novel' contradicts the premise because it suggests a different reason for roy's inability to write a novel. it is not logically inferred from the given information.step 3: based on the logical analysis and the lack of a connection between the premise and hypothesis, the hypothesis is not entailed by the premise."
1778,"Instead, on May 16, the Vice Presidentas Counsel sent GAO a letter questioning the appropriateness of GAOas review, expressing reluctance to supply the information requested and asking for a statement of GAOas legal authority to conduct the review.",The Vice President's Counsel received a prompt reply from GAO.,1,0,False,"step 1: in the premise, the vice president's counsel sent a letter to gao expressing reluctance and questioning the appropriateness of gao's review. the premise does not provide information about a reply from gao to this letter. step 2: the hypothesis states that the vice president's counsel received a prompt reply from gao. however, the premise does not logically entail this hypothesis. the premise only mentions the actions and communications initiated by the vice president's counsel, not any responses from gao. step 3: based on the information provided, the hypothesis cannot be logically inferred from the premise. the premise describes a situation where the vice president's counsel expressed reluctance and questioned the authority of gao's review, but it does not provide enough information to infer that gao responded with a prompt reply."
1779,This boy is in deep concentration playing a game of ping-pong.,The boy slept while playing a game,0,0,True,"step 1: the premise describes a scenario where a boy is in deep concentration while playing a game of ping-pong. this implies that the boy is focused and alert, actively engaging in the game. common sense and factual knowledge do not suggest that a person can sleep while in such a state of consciousness. step 2: the hypothesis, 'the boy slept while playing a game', contradicts the premise because it suggests that the boy was not in a state of concentration during the game, but rather asleep. step 3: based on the logical analysis, the hypothesis cannot be inferred from the premise as it contradicts the information provided in the premise."
1780,"However, there was nothing for it but to hope for the best.",There was no chance anything would come from their hoping.,1,0,False,"step 1: the premise expresses a sense of uncertainty and reliance on hope for a positive outcome. there is no explicit mention of a specific outcome or lack thereof. step 2: the hypothesis suggests the opposite of a positive outcome, stating that 'nothing would come from their hoping'. this contradicts the premise as it presents a different outcome. step 3: based on the logical analysis, the hypothesis is not entailed by the premise as it presents an outright negative outcome that contradicts the uncertain and hopeful tone of the premise."
1781,"And in conversation, refer to them as co-maids of honor.",There should not be conversation involving them.,0,0,True,"step 1: in the premise, it is stated that in a conversation, two individuals should be referred to as co-maids of honor. this implies a social context and a verbal interaction. no logical connections or contradictions are present within the premise.step 2: the hypothesis states that there should not be a conversation involving the individuals. this is a contradiction to the premise, which explicitly mentions a conversation. the hypothesis cannot be logically inferred from the premise as they state opposite conditions.step 3: based on the logical analysis, the hypothesis is not entailed by the premise."
1782,"For instance, the President's proposal permits the Secretary to allocate funds as he sees fit, without regard to the original purpose of the appropriations.",The President proposed the funds be burned on a bonfire each night.,0,0,True,"step 1: in the premise, it is stated that the secretary can allocate funds as he sees fit, disregarding the original purpose of the appropriations. this implies that the president's proposal grants significant discretionary power to the secretary. step 2: the hypothesis suggests an unusual and unexpected use of the funds – burning them each night. however, the premise does not restrict the allowed uses of the funds, nor does it specify how the secretary must allocate them. consequently, the hypothesis cannot be logically inferred from the premise as it goes beyond the information provided. step 3: based on the information given in the premise, there is no entailment of the hypothesis."
1783,no i could smell an accent a mile away,I can't pick up on accidents worth a darn.,0,0,True,"step 1: in the premise, the speaker expresses their ability to detect accents. this is a subjective statement about the speaker's perception and does not provide specific information about the context or the accents in question. step 2: the hypothesis states the opposite of the premise, expressing a lack of ability to pick up on accents. this is a clear contradiction of the information provided in the premise. step 3: based on the logical analysis and contradiction with the premise, the hypothesis is not entailed by the premise."
1784,"Part of recognizing that Touch of Evil is a masterpiece means also recognizing that it's often suffocatingly unpleasant, and that Welles is working off his aggression for the vast, trash-movie audience that he hoped to attract.",Welles is working off his aggression by punching a punching bag.,1,0,False,"step 1: in the premise, it is stated that touch of evil is a masterpiece, but also often unpleasant, and orson welles is working off his aggression for the 'vast, trash-movie audience' he hoped to attract. this implies that welles is putting a significant amount of effort and energy into creating this unpleasant masterpiece. step 2: the hypothesis suggests welles working off his aggression in a different way, specifically by punching a punching bag. however, the premise does not provide any evidence or indication that welles is physically punching a bag to express aggression. step 3: based on the information provided in the premise, the hypothesis cannot be logically inferred. the premise does not provide enough detail or specific evidence to support the hypothesis."
1786,oh God wouldn't that be horrible of course uh-huh,We should try to prevent it.,1,1,True,"step 1: in the premise, the speaker expresses a strong negative emotion towards a hypothetical situation. however, the premise does not provide enough context to identify the specific entities or actions involved. step 2: the hypothesis suggests an action to prevent a potential negative event. given the context of the premise's strong emotional response, it is reasonable to infer that the negative event the speaker is referring to is the same event that the hypothesis aims to prevent. step 3: based on this reasoning, the hypothesis can be inferred from the premise as it addresses the same situation and aims to mitigate the negative outcome expressed in the premise.step 4: it's important to note that this inference is based on the assumption that the speaker in the premise is expressing their thoughts aloud and that the hypothesis is being offered as a response to the situation described in the premise. inferring from ambiguous or emotionally charged statements can be risky, as they might not always have a clearly logical connection to the premise."
1787,'I think it should be celebrated.,I think that deal is worth celebrating.,1,1,True,"step 1: both the premise and hypothesis are expressed as opinions about a 'thing' or 'deal'. the opinion in the premise is 'it should be celebrated'. the opinion in the hypothesis is 'that deal is worth celebrating'. the similarity in the structure and meaning of the two statements suggests they may be related.step 2: the hypothesis can be logically inferred from the premise as the 'deal' in the hypothesis is the same as 'it' in the premise. the hypothesis is a more specific version of the premise, implying that the deal is the thing that should be celebrated.step 3: based on the logical relationship between the two statements and the lack of contradictory information, the hypothesis can be inferred from the premise."
1788,One opportunist who stayed was Octavius Decatur Gass.,Octavius Decatur Gass refers to four people. ,0,0,True,"step 1: in the premise, octavius decatur gass is identified as one opportunist who stayed. the name 'octavius decatur gass' consists of three distinct parts. step 2: the hypothesis suggests that 'octavius decatur gass' refers to four people. this is a contradiction with the premise, as the premise states that octavius decatur gass is a single person. step 3: based on the contradictory nature of the hypothesis with the premise, it cannot be logically inferred from the premise."
1789,"It was all, they insist, a statistical hoax.","It was a hoax , but it was nothing worth noting.",0,0,True,"step 1: in the premise, 'it was all, they insist, a statistical hoax' implies that someone is claiming that a statistical result or study was falsified. the hypothesis 'it was a hoax, but it was nothing worth noting' suggests that the hoax was insignificant or trivial. step 2: a hoax being insignificant or trivial does not logically contradict the premise, as the premise only establishes that it was a hoax, not its significance. step 3: the hypothesis can be inferred from the premise as a possible implication, though it may require additional context or information to determine its factual accuracy."
1790,"Oh yes, my friends, a letter.","Oh yes, a letter came by today.",1,1,True,"step 1: in the premise, the speaker mentions 'a letter.' this indicates that there is a letter present or recently received. no specific information is given about when the letter was received. in the hypothesis, it is stated that 'a letter came by today.' this suggests that the letter was received today.step 2: the hypothesis is consistent with the premise. the presence of a letter according to the premise does not contradict the hypothesis that a letter was received today. in fact, the hypothesis is a more specific version of the information in the premise.step 3: based on the logical relationship between the premise and hypothesis, the hypothesis can be inferred from the premise. the premise does not explicitly state that the letter was received today, but the hypothesis makes this assumption based on the available information.step 4: it is also worth noting that the use of the phrase 'oh yes' in both the premise and hypothesis indicates agreement or affirmation, further supporting the connection between the two statements.therefore, the hypothesis can be logically inferred from the premise."
1791,Before meeting Jon he had never seen anything like it before.,He had grown up with something like this.,0,0,True,"step 1: the premise states that before meeting jon, he had never seen anything like it before. this means that there was an experience or object that was unfamiliar to him at that point in his life. step 2: the hypothesis suggests that he had grown up with something like this. this could mean that he was exposed to this experience or object frequently during his childhood. step 3: while the hypothesis cannot be logically inferred directly from the premise, as the information presented in the hypothesis contradicts the premise (he had seen this thing before, according to the hypothesis, but the premise states that he had never seen it before), it is possible that there is additional context or information not provided that could make the hypothesis entailed by the premise. for example, if it is known that jon grew up in an environment where this experience or object was common, then the hypothesis could be a reasonable explanation for why he had never found it remarkable before meeting someone else who had not grown up with it. however, without further information, the hypothesis cannot be logically inferred from the premise alone.step 4: based on the given information, the hypothesis is not entailed by the premise, as they present contradictory statements. however, with additional context or information, the hypothesis could become a reasonable explanation for the premise."
1792,"Lie back, and DON'T THINK.","Lie back, and do not use your crazy mind.",1,1,True,"step 1: in the premise, the instruction is given to 'lie back, and don't think'. this sentence can be broken down into two parts: 'lie back' and 'don't think'. 'lie back' is a simple instruction to assume a position. 'don't think' suggests not engaging or using the mind.step 2: the hypothesis, 'lie back, and do not use your crazy mind', is very similar in meaning to the premise. 'crazy mind' is a colloquial term often used to describe a mind that is agitated, restless, or filled with excessive thoughts. not using your crazy mind aligns with the instruction to 'not think' in the premise.step 3: based on the logical similarity between the premise and hypothesis, and the lack of contradictory information, the hypothesis can be logically inferred from the premise."
1793,The planets swung along their paths again and the sun was in the most favorable house for conjuration.,"The sun stood firmly in place, in the house for conjuration.",1,0,False,"step 1: in the premise, the planets are described as 'swinging along their paths' and the sun being in the 'most favorable house for conjuration'. this implies that the planets and sun are moving according to their celestial orbits. the context suggests that 'the most favorable house for conjuration' refers to an astrological term where certain positions of planets or the sun are believed to be favorable for performing magical rituals.step 2: the hypothesis, however, states that 'the sun stood firmly in place'. this directly contradicts the premise, as the premise states that the sun is moving.step 3: based on the information identified in step 1 and the logical contradiction between the premise and hypothesis, it can be concluded that the hypothesis is not entailed by the premise."
1794,"A new school of Jewish historians is more critical of the dislocations caused by Jewish land acquisition, and concludes that it was not always fair.",The dislocations were widespread.,1,1,True,"step 1: in the premise, a new school of jewish historians is described as being more critical of jewish land acquisition and its resulting dislocations, concluding that it was not always fair. this implies that there were dislocations that occurred as a result of jewish land acquisition.step 2: the hypothesis, 'the dislocations were widespread', can be inferred from the premise, as the premise itself acknowledges that there were dislocations which were deemed not fair by the historians. the hypothesis expands on the information given in the premise, but it does not contradict it in any way.step 3: based on the information provided, the hypothesis is a logical inference from the premise. the premise sets up the context and the hypothesis adds additional detail without contradicting the initial information."
1795,A young girl holding a stuffed pig smiles.,A young child holds a stuffed pig.,1,1,True,"step 1: in the premise, a young girl is holding a stuffed pig and smiling. the key information is that a young girl is interacting with a stuffed pig. step 2: the hypothesis states that a young child holds a stuffed pig. this is logically equivalent to the premise as 'young child' is a subgroup of 'young girl'. therefore, the hypothesis can be inferred from the premise. step 3: based on the logical equivalence, the hypothesis is entailed by the premise."
1796,"The rules come from baseball and are modified to fit the situation, i.e. whether it is played indoors or outside.","The rules come from baseball and are modified to fit the situation, i.e. whether it is played indoors or inside.",1,1,True,"step 1: in the premise, it is stated that the rules come from baseball and are modified based on whether the game is played indoors or outside. this implies that the rules have a base origin in baseball, but they can change depending on the specific context. the hypothesis is identical in meaning to the premise, simply using 'inside' instead of 'outside'. step 2: since the hypothesis is the same as the premise, but with a synonymous change of 'outside' to 'inside', the hypothesis can be logically inferred from the premise. the hypothesis does not contradict or add any new information, it is just a rephrased version of the premise. step 3: based on the logical equivalence of the hypothesis to the premise, and the lack of any contradictory information, the hypothesis is entailed by the premise."
1797,"Take, therefore, the talent from him [who had one talent] and give it unto him which hath ten talents, Murdoch read.",Murdoch is physically unable to leave.,0,0,True,"step 1. in the premise, murdoch is having a talent taken from him and given to someone else. no information is provided about murdoch's physical abilities or his current location. the text is from the bible, matthew 25:28-29, which is discussing the parable of the talents.step 2. the hypothesis, 'murdoch is physically unable to leave,' is not logically inferred from the given premise. the premise does not provide any information about murdoch's physical condition or his ability to leave a location. the hypothesis seems unrelated to the premise.step 3. based on the information given in the premise and the lack of logical connection between the premise and the hypothesis, the hypothesis is not entailed by the premise."
1798,"The film was nominated for the inaugural Academy Award for Documentary Feature in 1943, but lost against four other Allied propaganda films.","The film was nominated for the inaugural Academy Award for Documentary Feature in 1944, but lost against four other Allied propaganda films.",0,0,True,"step 1: the premise provides information about a film that was nominated for the inaugural academy award for documentary feature in 1943 but lost. it also mentions that there were four other allied propaganda films that won instead. step 2: the hypothesis is similar to the premise but differs in the year mentioned. the hypothesis suggests that the film was nominated in 1944 instead. step 3: however, the hypothesis contradicts the premise based on the provided information, as the premise clearly states that the event occurred in 1943. it is important to note that the information in the premise is factual and does not leave room for error or misinterpretation. step 4: therefore, the hypothesis cannot be logically inferred from the premise as it contradicts it.step 5: the hypothesis is not entailed by the premise, as the premise describes an event that took place in 1943, and the hypothesis describes an event taking place in an alternate year."
1799,yeah well see that was that's another if i would have been home probably wouldn't have watched it because i have class tonight and i would have missed the second half and that's the most frustrating because that's you know you can if you missed the first half,I will skip class tonight so that I can watch the whole show.,0,0,True,"step 1: in the premise, the speaker expresses regret about missing the second half of a show due to having class. this implies that they value watching the show and are willing to miss class for it. the hypothesis suggests that the speaker will skip class to watch the whole show.step 2: the hypothesis contradicts the premise as the speaker in the premise is expressing regret about missing the show due to having class, whereas in the hypothesis, they plan to miss class to watch the show.step 3: based on the information provided, the hypothesis cannot be logically inferred from the premise as they contradict each other. the premise describes a past regret about missing class for the show, while the hypothesis suggests a future intention to miss class for the show."
1800,well i think that it's been proven since somewhere in the early nineteen hundreds that rehabilitation in the forms that we have been attempting it is not realistic um i can't remember the study but it was there was a quite a long-term study done in Europe that uh evaluated the incarceration systems that America has based their systems on and uh it's been proven useless for rehabilitation uh which is what a lot of people tend to believe happens in a prison and um there are amount of reforms that could be helpful in that area are numerous and costly and would  require require a lot of task forces and et cetera and um there is a lot of people in our country that would go right off the roof  um are do you work with the inmates themselves,Our rehabilitation techniques are flawless.,0,0,True,"step 1. the premise discusses a study from europe that suggests the rehabilitation methods used in american prisons are not effective. the speaker also mentions that there are numerous and costly reforms that could be helpful but are not currently being implemented. step 2. the hypothesis, 'our rehabilitation techniques are flawless,' directly contradicts the information in the premise. the premise states that rehabilitation techniques are not effective, while the hypothesis asserts they are perfect. step 3. based on the information provided, the hypothesis cannot be logically inferred from the premise. in fact, it contradicts the premise."
1801,no it's not even that,"It's not that, but it could be something else.",1,0,False,"step 1: in the premise, 'no it's not even that', the speaker is denying the truth of a previous statement, 'it's not that'. this implies that there is another possible statement, 'but it could be something else', which is being suggested as an alternative. however, no new information about the nature of 'something else' is provided in the premise.step 2: the hypothesis, 'it's not that, but it could be something else', is consistent with the premise because the premise does not deny the hypothesis. in fact, the hypothesis is a possible continuation of the premise, as it suggests a different explanation for the situation that the premise described.step 3: based on the given information and logical principles, the hypothesis is not logically entailed by the premise, but it is not contradictory to it either. the premise and hypothesis describe different possible explanations for the situation."
1802,"Years afterwards, Hardwick appeared at Swift's house, but Swift rejected him.","Years afterwards, Hardwick appeared at Swift's house, but Li Ting rejected him.",0,0,True,"step 1. the premise describes an event where hardwick appeared at swift's house, and swift rejected him. this implies that swift had the authority or control to accept or reject hardwick. no information is given about li ting or her relationship with swift or hardwick. step 2. the hypothesis suggests that instead of swift, li ting was the one who rejected hardwick at swift's house. however, the premise does not entail or provide any reason to believe that li ting was present or involved in the rejection. step 3. based on the information provided in the premise, the hypothesis cannot be logically inferred or entailed, as there is no evidence or reason to believe that li ting was involved in the rejection."
1803,It also compromised the business interests of private couriers.,It also compromised the business interests of porters and private couriers.,1,1,True,"step 1: the premise indicates that the action compromised the business interests of private couriers. business interests generally refer to the profits, sales, or success of a business or industry. the term 'private couriers' refers to companies or individuals who provide delivery or transportation services for a fee.step 2: the hypothesis suggests an extension of the premise, stating that not only private couriers but also porters were affected. porters are typically individuals who carry heavy loads from one place to another for compensation. they often work in industries such as construction, manufacturing, or transportation. given that the premise already mentions private couriers, it is reasonable to infer that the action also affected porters if they are part of the same industry or if their business interests are interconnected with those of private couriers.step 3: based on the logical reasoning and the fact that porters and private couriers might have interconnected business interests, the hypothesis can be inferred from the premise."
1804,And count me among those who do.,Don't expect me to be involved at all.,0,0,True,"step 1: in the premise, the speaker is expressing agreement with a statement or position. 'and count me among those who do' implies that the speaker shares the same opinion or belief as the group mentioned. there are no contradictory statements or facts in the premise.step 2: the hypothesis represents a contrary situation where the speaker is not involved at all. however, there is no indication in the premise that the speaker's involvement is a given, let alone an expectation. the hypothesis contradicts the premise, as the speaker's agreement implies some level of involvement.step 3: based on the logical analysis, the hypothesis is not entailed by the premise because the premise does not provide sufficient information to infer the hypothesis."
1805,"It was heavily damaged in the February 2011 Christchurch earthquake, and all was demolished after the earthquakes.","It was heavily damaged in the February 2011 Christchurch earthquake, and all but its western façade was demolished after the earthquakes.",1,1,True,"step 1: the premise states that a building was heavily damaged during the february 2011 christchurch earthquake and was demolished afterward. the hypothesis also states that the building was heavily damaged during the earthquake but only its western façade was demolished. the key information from both the premise and hypothesis includes the building's damage during the earthquake and the subsequent demolition.step 2: the hypothesis does not contradict the premise; rather, it specifies the extent of the demolition. the hypothesis can be considered a more detailed or refined version of the premise.step 3: based on the logical reasoning that the hypothesis is a more detailed version of the premise and does not contradict it, the hypothesis can be inferred from the premise.step 4: it is also worth noting that the hypothesis does not introduce any new or contradictory facts, making it a valid inference."
1806,"If the New York Post 's candidate for immortality was Headless Body in Topless Bar, USA Today `s might have been USA is Eating its Vegetables.",The New York Post's choice for immortality was far worse to the USA Today's.,1,1,True,"step 1. the premise is a conditional statement comparing the choices for 'immortality' made by two different newspapers, new york post and usa today. it implies that the new york post's choice is considered less desirable or inappropriate by usa today. the hypothesis also implies a comparison between the two choices and suggests that new york post's choice is worse than usa today's.step 2. the hypothesis can be logically inferred from the premise since the premise establishes that the new york post's choice is less desirable or inappropriate, and the hypothesis reinforces this idea by stating that it is 'worse' than usa today's choice.step 3. based on the logical reasoning and the consistent comparison of the choices made in both the premise and hypothesis, the hypothesis can be inferred from the premise."
1807,"The moats and turrets ' though Gothic in style ' are purely decorative, and the staircase is noted for its innovative straight flights and landings rather than the old spiral form that was designed to fend off invaders.",All the moats and turrets are fully functional and were used in many wars.,0,0,True,"step 1: in the premise, it is stated that the moats and turrets are decorative and are not designed for defensive purposes. the presence of a staircase with straight flights and landings instead of spiral forms further supports this. step 2: the hypothesis states that all the moats and turrets are fully functional and were used in many wars. however, this directly contradicts the information in the premise. step 3: based on the logical inconsistency between the premise and hypothesis, the hypothesis cannot be inferred from the premise."
1808,All time was not created equal.,The importance of time is subjective.,1,1,True,"step 1: in the premise, 'all time was not created equal' implies that there are differences in the significance or value of various time periods or instances. this is a factual statement that does not contradict the hypothesis. step 2: the hypothesis, 'the importance of time is subjective,' proposes that the value or significance of time is dependent on individual perception or experience. this idea is consistent with the premise, as the differences in the value of time could depend on subjective factors. step 3: based on the logical consistency and lack of contradiction between the premise and hypothesis, the hypothesis can be inferred from the premise as a possible explanation for the existence of differences in the value of time."
1811,"This knowledge, coupled with vast experience in manufacturing trucks, ensured the stability of the 797-truck design before initial manufacturing started.",The initial design required several reworkings before it was submitted.,1,0,False,"step 1: in the premise, the knowledge and experience in manufacturing trucks contributed to the stability of the 797-truck design before production began. this implies a well-planned and refined design. step 2: the hypothesis suggests that the initial design required several reworkings. this means that there were initial design issues that needed to be addressed. step 3: however, the premise does not indicate any design instability or need for reworkings in the development of the 797-truck design. in fact, it suggests the opposite. therefore, the hypothesis cannot be logically inferred from the premise. step 4: it's important to note that having a stable design does not necessarily mean that there were no design changes or reworkings during the development process. it just means that the design was solid enough to start manufacturing without significant issues. the hypothesis does not provide enough information to determine if these reworkings occurred after the initial design was submitted and stable.step 5: therefore, based on the information provided in the premise and hypothesis, there is no entailment relationship between the two."
1812,"These expenditures include production incentives and investment tax credits for renewable energy, energy efficiency and transportation technologies.",the expenditures do not include production incentives and investment tax credits.,0,0,True,"step 1: in the premise, 'these expenditures' are explicitly stated to include 'production incentives and investment tax credits for renewable energy, energy efficiency and transportation technologies'. step 2: the hypothesis, on the other hand, states that 'these expenditures do not include production incentives and investment tax credits'. this directly contradicts the information given in the premise. step 3: based on the logical negation of the premise, the hypothesis is not entailed by the premise."
1813,1 The laws are wrong to apply castration indiscriminately.,The laws wrongly apply many other things indiscriminately as well.,1,1,True,"step 1: the premise expresses a criticism of the laws for applying castration without discretion. the criticism implies a belief that indiscriminate application is an improper or unjust use of the laws. step 2: the hypothesis suggests that the laws wrongly apply other things indiscriminately, implying a broader criticism of the laws. this criticism is related to the premise as they both express concerns about the improper application of the laws. step 3: the hypothesis can be inferred from the premise as it expands upon the premise's critique by suggesting a pattern of improper application, not just limited to castration."
1814,When are they appropriately used in evaluation?,There are guidelines for when they can be used in an evaluation.,1,1,True,"step 1: in the premise, 'they' refers to 'when are they' which likely refers to certain procedures, methods, or criteria used in evaluation. the question asks for an answer in the form of guidelines or rules. step 2: the hypothesis states that there are guidelines for when 'they' (the procedures, methods, or criteria) can be used in an evaluation. this is a logical inference from the premise as the presence of 'when' implies that there is a specific context or condition under which 'they' should be used. step 3: based on the logical relationship between the premise and hypothesis, and the lack of contradictory information, the hypothesis is entailed by the premise."
1815,"Annie was a fine, strapping girl, and was evidently labouring under intense excitement, mingled with a certain ghoulish enjoyment of the tragedy. ","Annie was a homely, weak girl. ",0,0,True,"step 1: in the premise, annie is described as a 'fine, strapping girl' which is an expression often used to describe someone as healthy, robust, and strong. the phrase 'labouring under intense excitement' suggests that she is experiencing strong emotions. the term 'ghoulish enjoyment' implies an unusual or strange fascination with the tragedy. these descriptions do not necessarily contradict the hypothesis, but they do not support it either. step 2: the hypothesis 'annie was a homely, weak girl' is not logically entailed by the premise. the premise describes annie as 'fine' and 'strapping', which is the opposite of 'homely' and 'weak'. step 3: based on the information provided, the hypothesis 'annie was a homely, weak girl' cannot be logically inferred from the premise."
1816,and uh because i noticed that uh like even going to church uh seems like people really dress up a lot more uh here in North Dallas going to church,People don't dress up at all at churches in North Dallas. ,0,0,True,"step 1: in the premise, it is mentioned that people in north dallas dress up a lot more when going to church. this observation implies that churchgoers in north dallas follow a custom or expectation of dressing formally. step 2: the hypothesis states that people don't dress up at all when attending churches in north dallas. this proposition contradicts the information provided in the premise, as it suggests that no dressing up occurs at all, which is in direct opposition to the formally-dressed attire mentioned. step 3: based on the logical analysis, the hypothesis cannot be inferred from the premise, as it contradicts the information presented in the premise."
1817,"Finally, in 1557, they were all consolidated in Macau.","In 1557, their consolidation in Macau was followed up with new legislation.",1,1,True,"step 1: the premise describes the consolidation of certain entities (not specified) in macau in the year 1557. this event implies a coming together or unification of these entities. no specific information about legislation is mentioned in the premise. however, the use of the word 'consolidated' can suggest that formal structures or rules may have been put in place. step 2: the hypothesis posits that new legislation was enacted following the consolidation of these entities in macau in 1557. this is a logical inference because the establishment of formal structures or rules (consolidation) often involves the creation of new laws or legislation. the hypothesis is not contradictory to the premise as it adds additional information that can be inferred from the given context. step 3: based on the logical connection between consolidation and legislation, the hypothesis can be inferred from the premise."
1818,North Hampton uh-huh i'm from Maine originally,"North Hampton is where I grew up, as I am from Main.",1,1,True,"step 1: in the premise, the speaker identifies themselves as being from maine originally. this means that their place of origin is in maine. in the hypothesis, the speaker claims that north hampton is where they grew up. step 2: given that the speaker is from maine originally, it is a reasonable inference that north hampton is indeed the place where they grew up. this is because the origin place and the place of upbringing are often the same, unless specific circumstances exist to contradict this. step 3: based on the logical connection between being from a place and growing up there, and the absence of contradictory information, the hypothesis can be inferred from the premise.step 4: it is also worth noting that the speaker's statement in the premise, 'i'm from maine originally', does implicitly include the information that they grew up in maine, making the hypothesis a redundant statement, but not contradictory.label: 1"
1819,"While the NEPDG did provide some cost-related documents to GAO, most of these documents were not useful or self-explanatory.",All the documents at GAO are highly useful. ,0,0,True,"step 1: in the premise, it is stated that while some cost-related documents were provided to gao by the nepdg, most of these documents were not useful or self-explanatory. this implies that the documents in question lacked clarity or relevance to the issue at hand.step 2: the hypothesis states that all the documents at gao are highly useful. this is a contradiction to the premise as it implies that all documents were useful.step 3: based on the information provided, the hypothesis cannot be logically inferred from the premise as it contradicts the stated facts.step 4: the hypothesis is not entailed by the premise."
1820,I wanted to help her.,I wanted to help her by giving her money.,1,0,False,"step 1: the premise states that you wanted to help her, but it does not provide any information about how or what you wanted to help her with. it is a common desire and action to help others, and the means of help can vary greatly.step 2: the hypothesis suggests that you wanted to help her by giving her money. this is a specific way of helping someone, but it is not logically implied in the premise. helping someone can be accomplished in many ways, including giving advice, lending a hand, or providing resources. giving money is one such way, but it is not mentioned in the premise.step 3: based on the given information, the hypothesis cannot be logically inferred from the premise. the premise is too general to imply the specific action of giving money to help someone."
1821,Mr. Wells told me as we were going upstairs.,Mr Wells went downstairs.,0,0,True,"step 1: in the premise, 'as we were going upstairs' indicates that mr. wells and the speaker were moving up the stairs. this information is about the past actions of mr. wells and the speaker. 'mr. wells told me' is an independent action that can occur in various locations. the location of this action is not mentioned in the premise.step 2: the hypothesis 'mr. wells went downstairs' contradicts the information in the premise since they were going upstairs at that moment. there is no logical connection or justification for the hypothesis based on the information provided in the premise.step 3: based on the given information, the hypothesis 'mr. wells went downstairs' cannot be logically inferred from the premise."
1822,he um it it of course it was much more prevalent in Europe exercise was much more taken much more seriously than it was here in fact it it hasn't it's just now getting to the level where it was in Europe you know now with everybody is going to the health clubs and everything,Europe has always been behind us in exercise and fitness.,0,0,True,"step 1: the premise states that exercise was more prevalent and taken more seriously in europe historically, and it is now getting to the level where it was in europe. this implies that europe had a stronger focus on exercise and fitness than the current state in the speaker's location.step 2: the hypothesis suggests that europe has always been behind the speaker's location in terms of exercise and fitness. contrary to the hypothesis, the premise indicates that this was not the case historically.step 3: based on the information provided in the premise, the hypothesis is not logically inferred. in fact, the hypothesis contradicts the premise by suggesting a lesser focus on exercise and fitness in europe compared to the speaker's location, which is contradicted by the historical facts stated in the premise."
1823,"All of them slept in one cave on animal skins, a single large clay pot cooked all of their food.","Because they were poor, they could only afford to cook their food with a clay pot.",1,1,True,"step 1: in the premise, it is stated that 'all of them' slept in one cave and a single large clay pot cooked all of their food. this implies a situation where a group of people are living in poverty as they can only afford basic necessities. the use of animal skins for sleeping implies a lack of resources for bedding as well. step 2: the hypothesis 'because they were poor, they could only afford to cook their food with a clay pot' directly follows from the information in the premise. the given context suggests that the group's limited resources would not allow them to afford alternative cooking methods. step 3: based on the logical connection between the premise and hypothesis, the hypothesis can be inferred from the premise."
1824,"The most unique example, the nearby Casa de los Picos, bristles with pointed protuberances.",The Casa de los Picos is littered.,1,0,False,"step 1: in the premise, 'the casa de los picos' is described as a building that 'bristles with pointed protuberances'. this implies a dense covering of sharp, projecting features. step 2: the hypothesis 'the casa de los picos is littered' refers to a situation where there is a large collection of waste or debris scattered about. this concept is not logically connected to the premise as 'littered' does not naturally follow from 'bristles with pointed protuberances'. step 3: based on the given information, the hypothesis 'the casa de los picos is littered' cannot be logically inferred from the premise 'the casa de los picos bristles with pointed protuberances'."
1825,A man drags a young boy in swim trunks into the surf at what appears to be a beach in a tropical location.,A man is baking a loaf of bread.,0,0,True,"step 1: the premise describes a man and a young boy at a beach in a tropical location. swim trunks indicate that the boy is likely engaging in water activities. the man's actions towards the boy are not specified beyond 'dragging him into the surf'. there's no mention of bread or baking in the premise. common sense and logical analysis do not suggest any connection between the man dragging the boy and baking a loaf of bread.step 2: the hypothesis 'a man is baking a loaf of bread' is not logically entailed by the premise 'a man drags a young boy in swim trunks into the surf at what appears to be a beach in a tropical location'. the premise does not provide any information about baking or any related activities.step 3: based on the given information and logical analysis, the hypothesis 'a man is baking a loaf of bread' cannot be inferred from the premise."
1826,oh really if you had a choice of your car what would you get,What kind of car would you give if you had a blank check?,1,0,False,"step 1. the premise asks about the type of car someone would choose for themselves if given a choice. it suggests that the person has some preference or consideration when making their car selection. the hypothesis, however, asks about what kind of car someone would give if they had an unlimited budget. these are two different situations.step 2. the hypothesis cannot be logically inferred from the premise because the premise only describes the car someone would choose for themselves, not the car they would give. these are distinct actions.step 3. based on the logical analysis, the hypothesis is not entailed by the premise."
1827,well that's good that's great,I can't believe that actually happened.,1,0,False,"step 1: the premise is a declarative sentence expressing a positive statement. it does not provide any explicit logical relationships or key information that can be directly linked to the hypothesis. the hypothesis is an expression of surprise or disbelief, which does not logically follow from the premise.step 2: the hypothesis does not contradict the premise, but it does not logically follow from it either. the hypothesis is a statement about the speaker's reaction or opinion, which is not entailed by the premise.step 3: based on the given information, the hypothesis is not logically entailed by the premise. the premise describes an event, while the hypothesis is a statement about the speaker's reaction to that event."
1828,He had never been one to pick a fight or take up a challenge.,He always picked fights and challenges.,0,0,True,"step 1: in the premise, the information presented is that the subject had a history of not picking fights or taking up challenges. this implies a consistent pattern of behavior. common sense and logical understanding of the term 'never' suggest a strong negative.step 2: in the hypothesis, the information is that the subject always picks fights and challenges. this is the exact opposite of the premise. the use of 'always' implies a consistent pattern of behavior, but it contradicts the premise.step 3: based on the logical analysis and the contradictory nature of the hypothesis to the premise, the hypothesis cannot be inferred from the premise.step 4: furthermore, the hypothesis contradicts the factual information given in the premise.therefore,"
1829,Several men are sitting around a parking lot.,The people are standing up.,0,0,True,"step 1: the premise describes a scene where several men are seated in a parking lot. this information does not inherently limit the possible actions or positions of all people present to just sitting. it's possible for some individuals to be standing. step 2: the hypothesis suggests that the people (which may include the men from the premise, as well as any other individuals present) are standing up. this statement is not directly contradictory to the premise, as some men can still be seated. step 3: the hypothesis cannot be logically inferred from the premise because the premise does not guarantee that everyone is sitting, only that several men are. therefore, the hypothesis is not entailed by the premise."
1830,Electricity generators must install monitors to prove that they have sufficient allowances to match their actual emissions.,Actual emissions do not have to be measured after theoretical emissions are calculated.,0,0,True,"step 1: in the premise, electricity generators are required to install monitors to provide evidence that their theoretical emissions allowances match their actual emissions. this implies that there is a need for measuring and comparing actual emissions with theoretical ones. step 2: the hypothesis suggests that actual emissions do not need to be measured after theoretical emissions are calculated. this contradicts the premise, as the premise necessitates measuring actual emissions to ensure compliance. step 3: based on the provided information, the hypothesis cannot be logically inferred from the premise, as it contradicts the requirement for measuring actual emissions stated in the premise."
1831,right yeah oh that sounds good,"Oh no, I don't think that will taste good",0,0,True,"step 1: in this example, the premise and hypothesis are spoken sentences without explicit content. however, based on the context provided, it seems that the premise might be related to a discussion about eating something. the hypothesis expresses a speaker's opinion that the thing being discussed won't taste good. step 2: the hypothesis 'oh no, i don't think that will taste good' cannot be logically inferred from the premise 'right yeah oh that sounds good'. the hypothesis presents a negative opinion, while the premise is neutral. people can express agreement or acknowledgement of a statement without sharing their opinion about its taste. step 3: based on the information provided and logical reasoning, the hypothesis is not entailed by the premise."
1832,Tuppence's spirits revived to the normal.,He was feeling relief and happiness in that moment.,1,1,True,"step 1: 'tuppence's spirits revived to the normal' implies that tuppence's mood or energy level had improved. this could be due to various reasons, including feeling better after an illness or emotional distress. step 2: 'feeling relief and happiness' is a reasonable inference from 'revived to the normal' because these emotions are commonly associated with an improvement in mood or well-being. step 3: based on the logical connection between improved mood and the emotions of relief and happiness, the hypothesis can be inferred from the premise."
1833,He was the first scholar to describe in detail.,He was the first scholar to describe in detail and document the long-term cyclical relationship between global population cycles and cycles of political rebellion and revolution.,0,1,False,"step 1: in the premise, 'he was the first scholar to describe in detail' implies that the subject of the sentence was the initial person to provide a comprehensive explanation or account of something. it does not provide any specific information about what that something is. step 2: the hypothesis extends the premise by adding the additional detail that the subject described the long-term cyclical relationship between global population cycles and cycles of political rebellion and revolution. this relationship is a specific and documented historical phenomenon. step 3: given that the premise establishes that the subject was the first to describe something in detail, and the hypothesis describes a specific and documented historical phenomenon that is an extension of what was already established, it can be logically inferred that the hypothesis is entailed by the premise. this is because the hypothesis provides a more detailed explanation of what was initially described in the premise. step 4: the hypothesis is not contradictory to the premise, as the description of the long-term cyclical relationship between population cycles and political rebellion and revolution does not negate the fact that the subject was the first scholar to describe something in detail.thus, based on the logical reasoning, common sense, and lack of contradictory facts, the hypothesis can be inferred from the premise."
1834,"Yes, I believe they were at it yesterday afternoon. ",They had a huge fight. ,1,0,False,"step 1: in the premise, the speaker confirms that 'they' had an interaction yesterday afternoon, but no specific details about the nature of that interaction are provided. step 2: having a 'huge fight' is a type of interaction, and it's not logically impossible for two individuals to have such an interaction in the context of the premise. common sense suggests that strong emotions and conflicts can arise in various situations. step 3: however, the hypothesis cannot be logically inferred from the premise because the premise does not provide enough information to entail the hypothesis. the premise only states that 'they' interacted, and 'having a huge fight' is a possible but not guaranteed outcome."
1835,"Nevertheless, more capacity is scheduled to come on in the U.S. during the near future.",There is a scheduled decrease in capacity in the near future. ,0,0,True,"step 1: in the premise, 'more capacity is scheduled to come on in the u.s. during the near future', implies an addition or increase in capacity. no information is given about a decrease in capacity. step 2: the hypothesis, 'there is a scheduled decrease in capacity in the near future', contradicts the premise because it suggests a decrease, which is not mentioned or implied in the premise. step 3: based on the logical analysis, the hypothesis 'there is a scheduled decrease in capacity in the near future' cannot be logically inferred from the premise 'more capacity is scheduled to come on in the u.s. during the near future'."
1836,"When the elephant has located a tiger, the mahout signals and you hop aboard his howdah to penetrate the jungle.","Elephants are unafraid of tigers, which is why they are used to find them.",1,1,True,"step 1: in the premise, the situation described is that an elephant, which is being controlled by a mahout, enters the jungle to locate a tiger. this implies that the elephant is not afraid of the tiger, as it is being used to find and confront the tiger. step 2: the hypothesis suggests that elephants are unafraid of tigers, explaining why they are used to locate them. this hypothesis is a logical and common-sense conclusion based on the information provided in the premise. step 3: the hypothesis is entailed by the premise, as the premise establishes that elephants are not afraid of tigers in this context."
1837,"It  disgusting, childish, and unnecessary.",The court case was childish and irresponsible.,1,1,True,"step 1: the premise expresses a judgment or opinion that something is disgusting, childish, and unnecessary. these words convey a sense of immaturity or lack of seriousness. step 2: the hypothesis also expresses a judgment or opinion, but it specifically refers to a court case as being childish and irresponsible, which aligns with the meaning of 'childish' in the premise. there is no contradiction between the two statements. step 3: based on the logical equivalence of the opinions expressed in the premise and hypothesis, and the lack of contradictory information, the hypothesis can be inferred from the premise."
1838,yeah i think they should change the whole system so that it's easier i think i think more people would do it if it wasn't such a hassle,"It is an enormous hassle, and that is preventing people from doing it, so they should completely change the system.",1,1,True,"step 1: in the premise, the speaker expresses their opinion that the system is a hassle and more people would do it if it were easier. this implies that there is a current barrier to entry preventing people from doing it, which is the hassle.step 2: the hypothesis states that the hassle is an 'enormous' barrier, which is a stronger version of the premise's 'hassle' claim. the hypothesis also suggests completely changing the system as a solution to the hassle.step 3: the hypothesis can be logically inferred from the premise. the premise implies that the hassle is preventing people from doing it, and the hypothesis states that the enormous hassle is the reason and proposes the same solution: changing the system. this inference is based on the logical connection between the premise's claim about the hassle and the hypothesis's strengthened claim about the hassle and its proposed solution."
1839,"OK, two.)","Ok, four.",0,0,True,"step 1: neither the premise nor the hypothesis contain any meaningful information as they are just numbers without context. step 2: in the absence of any logical or semantic connection between the premise and hypothesis, it is impossible to determine if the hypothesis can be logically inferred from the premise. step 3: no entailment exists between the premise and hypothesis."
1840,At just 5 km (3 miles) in length it is more manageable than some of the larger lakes.,It is deeper than the larger lakes.,1,0,False,"step 1: in the premise, the size of the lake is described as 'more manageable' than some larger lakes, which implies that it is smaller in size. the depth of a lake is not mentioned. step 2: the hypothesis states that the lake is deeper than larger lakes, which is a contradiction to the size information given in the premise. step 3: the hypothesis cannot be logically inferred from the premise as the premise does not entail the hypothesis, and the hypothesis contradicts the information provided in the premise."
1841,No new elder had yet been selected but everyone expected the blacksmith Grado to take the seat.,Everyone thought Grado was the most qualified to be the new elder.,1,1,True,"step 1: in the premise, it is stated that everyone expects grado to become the new elder, but no elder has been officially selected yet. this implies that grado is a strong contender for the position. step 2: the hypothesis suggests that everyone thinks grado is the most qualified for the role of the new elder. since everyone's expectations align with this belief, it is a reasonable inference that grado's qualifications are the reason for their expectations. thus, the hypothesis can be logically inferred from the premise. step 3: based on the logical reasoning and the lack of contradictory information, the hypothesis is entailed by the premise."
1842,Walk through the gateway and you'll find yourself in an immense open space the largest temple courtyard in the country.,There are no courtyards in the country besides this one.,0,0,True,"step 1: the premise describes a large temple courtyard, which is the largest in the country according to the information given. it does not provide any details about other courtyards or their sizes. step 2: the hypothesis asserts that there are no other courtyards in the country besides this one. this statement directly contradicts the premise, as the premise does not rule out the existence of other courtyards, but only states that this is the largest one known. step 3: based on the logical analysis, the hypothesis cannot be inferred from the premise, as the premise does not provide enough information to support the hypothesis."
1843,"The 2006 Tony Awards did not feature a host, but instead over 60 stars presented awards at the ceremony.","The 2007 Tony Awards did not feature a host, but instead over 60 stars presented awards at the ceremony.",0,1,False,"step 1: in the premise, it is stated that the 2006 tony awards did not have a host and instead had over 60 stars presenting awards. this information provides context about the structure of the 2006 tony awards ceremony. step 2: the hypothesis is identical to the premise in all essential respects, with the exception of the year. the absence of a host and the presence of over 60 stars presenting awards are common elements between the two sentences. step 3: given the similarity between the premise and hypothesis, and the lack of any contradictory information, the hypothesis can be logically inferred from the premise. if the structure of the 2006 tony awards ceremony was a valid precedent, it stands to reason that the same structure could have been employed in subsequent years, such as the 2007 tony awards. step 4: common sense and logical consistency support the conclusion that the hypothesis can be inferred from the premise. step 5: based on the logical reasoning, the similarity between the premise and hypothesis, and the lack of contradictory information, the hypothesis is entailed by the premise."
1844,yeah well i think uh that based on um certain crimes it uh is merited uh there was a case just recently i don't know if you uh if you heard about this in uh New Hampshire i believe about the uh teacher school teacher who hired her uh one of her high school students to kill her husband and they found her guilty and gave her life with no parole,Everybody who commits a crime gets life in prison.,1,0,False,"step 1: in the premise, a specific instance is provided of a teacher who was convicted of hiring a student to kill her husband and was sentenced to life in prison without parole. this instance demonstrates a situation where a person who committed a crime received a life sentence.step 2: the hypothesis proposes a universal statement that 'everybody who commits a crime gets life in prison'. while the specific instance in the premise supports the hypothesis, it is not enough to logically infer that the hypothesis holds true for all cases. there may be other instances where the sentence for committing a crime is different, such as probation, community service, or a prison term less than life.step 3: although the premise provides an example that aligns with the hypothesis, the hypothesis itself cannot be logically inferred from the premise alone. the premise only illustrates a single instance of the crime resulting in a life sentence, and the hypothesis extends beyond that instance to cover all crimes and their potential penalties."
1845,"He was initially a singer - songwriter in the soft rock genre, later as a solo artist.","He was initially a singer-songwriter in the soft rock genre, first as a member of the band Fat Chance, and later as a solo artist.",1,1,True,"step 1: in the premise, we have the information that the person was initially a singer-songwriter in the soft rock genre, and later became a solo artist. this implies a transition from being part of a band to performing alone.step 2: the hypothesis extends the premise by mentioning 'fat chance' as the name of the band the person was initially a part of. although the premise does not explicitly state the name of the band, the fact that the person was a singer-songwriter in a band before becoming a solo artist is consistent with the information in the hypothesis.step 3: based on the logical relationship between the premise and the hypothesis, the hypothesis can be inferred from the premise as it provides additional, consistent details about the person's musical background."
1846,This Balearic outpost boasts a sizeable salt lake but no fresh water.,The local lake is saltier than the Dead Sea.,1,1,True,"step 1: the premise states that the balearic outpost has a sizeable salt lake but no fresh water. this implies that the lake is primarily composed of salt water. the dead sea is known for its extremely high salt content. step 2: the hypothesis suggests that the local lake is saltier than the dead sea. since the dead sea is one of the saltiest bodies of water in the world, this implies that the local lake has an even higher salt content than the dead sea. step 3: given the information in the premise and the logical implication of the hypothesis, it can be inferred that the local lake is indeed saltier than the dead sea. step 4: it is important to note that the premise does not explicitly state that the local lake is the only water source in the balearic outpost, but the absence of fresh water mentioned in the premise makes it a reasonable assumption.step 5: common sense and logical consistency support this inference as well. the presence of large amounts of salt in the lake would make it less suitable for human consumption or agriculture, which aligns with the premise's statement that there is no fresh water.step 6: therefore, based on the logical reasoning, common sense, and the information provided in the premise, the hypothesis can be inferred from the premise."
1847,"The green and fertile region round Naples, between the Tyrrhenian coast and the western slopes of the Apennines, was colonized by the Etruscans and Greeks.",The Naples area is infertile.,0,0,True,"step 1: the premise states that the naples area was colonized by the etruscans and greeks in a 'green and fertile' region. this suggests that the area was agriculturally productive and desirable for settlement based on historical context. common sense and factual knowledge indicate that people typically settle in areas with adequate resources for survival and growth. step 2: the hypothesis contradicts the premise, as it asserts the naples area as infertile. given the premise's description of the region as green and fertile, it is not logically possible for the hypothesis to be a valid inference. step 3: based on the logical inconsistency between the premise and hypothesis, the hypothesis is not entailed by the premise."
1848,The quality of water used for test organism culturing and for dilution water used in toxicity tests is extremely important.,The quality of water used for culturing and dilution doesn't really matter.,0,0,True,"step 1: in the premise, the importance of water quality for test organism culturing and for dilution water in toxicity tests is emphasized. this indicates that water quality plays a significant role in these processes. step 2: the hypothesis contradicts the premise by stating that the water quality does not matter. it is important to note that a hypothesis that contradicts a premise cannot be logically inferred from it. step 3: based on the logical inconsistency between the premise and hypothesis, the hypothesis cannot be inferred from the premise."
1849,The western door of the pair is open; the eastern door was bricked up after the Crusaders lost Jerusalem in 1187 and has remained shut ever since.,"Of the two, the western door was never open.",0,0,True,"step 1: in the premise, it is stated that the western door is open and the eastern door was bricked up after the crusaders lost jerusalem in 1187. the time frame provided in the premise suggests that the western door was open before the eastern door was bricked up. it is important to note that there is no contradictory information provided in the premise.step 2: the hypothesis suggests that the western door was never open, contradicting the information provided in the premise. therefore, based on the given information, the hypothesis cannot be logically inferred from the premise.step 3: in summary, the hypothesis 'of the two, the western door was never open' is not entailed by the premise, as the premise indicates that the western door was open at a certain point in time, and the hypothesis suggests that it was never open."
1850,"The main French newspapers focused on the enforced Arabization of Algeria, where, on Sunday, classical Arabic became the sole official language of the country, with the use of Algerian Arabic, Berber Arabic, and French being prohibited.",All languages are openly accepted and will never be prohibited in Algeria.,0,0,True,"step 1: in the premise, it is stated that classical arabic is the sole official language in algeria, and the use of algerian arabic, berber arabic, and french is prohibited. this indicates a current situation where only one language is officially recognized and others are not. this information is consistent with the known facts about algeria's language policies.step 2: the hypothesis, 'all languages are openly accepted and will never be prohibited in algeria', contradicts the premise. the premise describes a situation where some languages are prohibited, while the hypothesis claims that all languages are accepted and will never be prohibited.step 3: based on the logical analysis, the hypothesis cannot be inferred from the premise, as they represent opposing statements."
1851,Kids are on a amusement ride.,Kids ride an amusement ride.,1,1,True,"step 1: in the premise, 'kids' are stated to be 'on an amusement ride'. an amusement ride is a type of vehicle or attraction designed for the entertainment, enjoyment, or thrill of its passengers. the term 'amusement ride' clearly implies that kids are indeed 'riding' the ride. so, the premise and hypothesis convey the same basic meaning.step 2: the hypothesis can be logically inferred from the premise because 'riding an amusement ride' is the very activity that the premise describes. the hypothesis is a more general statement that includes the specific details given in the premise.step 3: given the logical equivalence between the premise and hypothesis, and the absence of any contradictory information, the hypothesis can be considered entailed by the premise."
1852,and then you know it took a few years to crap out but i mean it was dying last year i lived up in Boston,I have never lived in Boston.,0,0,True,"step 1: the premise describes a personal experience where the speaker lived in boston for some time, but it is also mentioned that the person or thing they were referring to (it) took a few years to 'crap out' and was dying last year. the meaning of 'it' is not clear from the premise. step 2: the hypothesis states that the speaker has never lived in boston. this contradicts the information in the premise that the speaker lived in boston for a few years. step 3: based on the contradiction between the premise and hypothesis, the hypothesis is not logically entailed by the premise."
1853,so what is your favorite TV program,What is your favorite book?,0,0,True,"step 1. in the premise, the speaker is asking about the favorite tv program of the person being addressed. this indicates a topic related to media entertainment. the hypothesis, on the other hand, is about a favorite book, which is also a form of media but a different one. step 2. the hypothesis cannot be logically inferred from the premise because the premise asks about tv programs, while the hypothesis refers to books. there is no logical connection between the two statements based on the given information. step 3. based on the lack of logical connection and the fact that the topics are different (tv programs and books), the hypothesis is not entailed by the premise."
1854,A young girl jumping in front of the White House.,Someone is visiting the statue of Liberty.,0,0,True,"step 1: in the premise, a young girl is jumping somewhere near the white house. the white house is located in washington d.c., and it is not near the statue of liberty. the statue of liberty is in new york city. the premise does not provide any factual basis to link the young girl's activity to the statue of liberty. step 2: the hypothesis suggests someone visiting the statue of liberty, which is unrelated to the events mentioned in the premise. there is no logical connection or implication from the premise to the hypothesis. step 3: based on the lack of logical connection and the factual inconsistency between the premise and hypothesis, the hypothesis cannot be inferred from the premise."
1855,and fixing the emergency brake,I have never fixed a break.,0,0,True,"step 1: in the premise, 'and fixing the emergency brake' refers to an action of repairing or maintaining an emergency brake. this requires some knowledge or experience in automotive mechanics.step 2: the hypothesis, 'i have never fixed a break', is a statement of personal experience or lack thereof. these two pieces of information are not directly related to each other. the hypothesis cannot be logically inferred from the premise as the premise is not about the speaker or their experiences.step 3: based on the given information, there is no logical entailment between the premise and the hypothesis."
1856,A woman is tugging on a white sheet and laughing,The person is amused.,1,1,True,"step 1: the premise describes a woman engaged in an action (tugging on a white sheet) accompanied by a reaction (laughing). laughter is a common sign of amusement. no contradictory information is given in the premise.step 2: the hypothesis, 'the person is amused,' follows logically from the premise, as the woman's laughter indicates she is experiencing amusement.step 3: based on logical reasoning and the common-sense understanding of laughter as a sign of amusement, the hypothesis can be inferred from the premise."
1857,"I am sure that, despite its logic, my position sounds unrealistic to many readers.",They were overwhelmed by the support of their position with their loyal readers.,0,0,True,"step 1: in the premise, the speaker expresses uncertainty about how their position may be perceived by others as unrealistic. this implies that there is a difference of opinion regarding the speaker's position.step 2: the hypothesis suggests an alternative perspective where the speakers are overwhelmed by support for their position from their loyal readers. these two sentences describe different scenarios.step 3: the hypothesis cannot be logically inferred from the premise as they describe unrelated phenomena. the hypothesis contradicts the premise's tone of uncertainty with a positive and opposite scenario.step 4: based on the logical reasoning, the hypothesis cannot be inferred from the premise."
1858,that's right draw your own inference um,That is the information they gave us so that we could make our own judgement.,1,1,True,"step 1. in the premise, there is a statement that the speaker is asking the listeners to draw their own inference from given information. this implies that there is some information provided that could potentially be used to make an inference. in the hypothesis, it is stated that the given information is for the purpose of making a judgment. these two sentences suggest that the hypothesis is restating the premise.step 2. since the hypothesis is a restatement of the premise, it can be logically inferred from the premise. the hypothesis does not add any new information or contradict the premise in any way.step 3. based on the logical relationship between the premise and hypothesis, and the lack of any contradictory information, the hypothesis is entailed by the premise."
1859,well he doesn't care as long as he's feeding his uh his family,"He cares, even if he's feeding his family.",0,0,True,"step 1: the premise describes a person's behavior, stating that he doesn't care as long as he's feeding his family. this implies that the person is focused on providing for his family and does not place much importance on other aspects of life or emotions. step 2: the hypothesis introduces a contradictory element by stating that the person cares, even while feeding his family. this seems to contradict the premise as caring and not caring are opposing emotional states. however, the premise does not explicitly state that the person does not care at all, only that he doesn't care 'as long as he's feeding his family'. it's possible that the person still cares about other things but prioritizes his family's needs. step 3: given the ambiguity of the premise and the potential for multiple interpretations, it's not possible to logically infer the hypothesis from the premise. the hypothesis introduces new information not implied in the premise and contradicts one possible interpretation of the premise."
1860,It was a real old bust-up. ,Everything was peaceful. ,0,0,True,"step 1: 'it was a real old bust-up' refers to a noisy, chaotic, or violent situation. this is an opposing description to 'everything was peaceful', which means the absence of noise, disturbance, or conflict.step 2: the hypothesis 'everything was peaceful' cannot be logically inferred from the premise 'it was a real old bust-up'. a 'real old bust-up' implies the exact opposite - far from peaceful.step 3: based on the logical analysis, the hypothesis 'everything was peaceful' is not entailed by the premise 'it was a real old bust-up'."
1861,"Now, if the girl had been placed there it would almost certainly be under an assumed name.""",She probably went there and announced her name to everyone.,0,0,True,"step 1: in the premise, it is suggested that if the girl had been present, she would have been under an assumed name. this implies that there was a reason to hide her identity. the hypothesis, however, suggests that she announced her name to everyone. step 2: the hypothesis contradicts the information in the premise as there is no indication or logical reason to believe that she announced her name. moreover, it goes against the assumption made in the premise that she would use an assumed name. step 3: based on the logical inconsistency between the premise and hypothesis, and the lack of evidence supporting the hypothesis, it cannot be logically inferred that the hypothesis follows from the premise."
1862,well i keep reminding these people that it's good thing we came down here and got some changes made like,"I can't be bothered with these people, much less what they do. ",0,0,True,"step 1: the premise is about the speaker reminding others about the benefits of their presence at a certain location and getting changes made. it does not provide any information about the speaker's feelings or attitudes towards the people they are interacting with. the hypothesis, on the other hand, expresses the speaker's indifference or lack of concern towards the people.step 2: there is no clear logical relationship between the premise and the hypothesis. the premise doesn't suggest or imply that the speaker holds the attitude expressed in the hypothesis.step 3: based on the given information, the hypothesis cannot be logically inferred from the premise."
1863,"And, just incidentally, the Sons of the Egg who'd attacked him in the hospital had tried to reach the camp twice already, once by interpenetrating into a shipment of mandrakes, which indicated to what measures they would resort.","The Sons of Egg attacked him in the hospital and were trying to reach the camp, but they never would.",1,0,False,"step 1: in the premise, it is stated that the sons of the egg attacked the person in the hospital and had attempted to reach the camp twice, once through a shipment of mandrakes. this indicates a pattern of aggressive behavior and intent to harm. common sense and the information given do not suggest that they have stopped trying to reach the camp.step 2: the hypothesis, on the other hand, states that they attacked him in the hospital and tried to reach the camp, but they never would. this contradicts the premise, as it suggests that they attempted to reach the camp but ultimately did not.step 3: the hypothesis cannot be logically inferred from the premise because it contradicts it. the premise indicates that they had attempted to reach the camp, while the hypothesis states that they never would. this is a significant difference that cannot be reasonably inferred from the information given in the premise."
1864,"This might be your idea of a semicircular sandy strip backed by sea grapes and tropical shrubs, gentle aquamarine surf, a coral reef close to shore, plus some rocks and seaweed for rewarding snorkeling and a view out to some huge pierced rocks (roches perc??es) that partly shelter the entrance to the cove.","The cove is the tourists ultimate getaway, tons of stuff to do, its the most popular on the island.",1,0,False,"step 1: the premise describes a scenic cove with various features such as a semicircular sandy strip, sea grapes and tropical shrubs, gentle aquamarine surf, a coral reef close to shore, rocks, seaweed, and roches percees. there is no inherent contradiction in the premise.step 2: the hypothesis suggests that the cove is the ultimate getaway for tourists and is the most popular on the island. while the premise does not explicitly state the popularity or number of tourists, it does mention the presence of various attractive features for snorkeling and enjoying the view. this could potentially make it a desirable destination for tourists.step 3: based on the information provided, the hypothesis is not logically inferred from the premise. however, given the common sense understanding that attractive natural features often draw tourists, it's reasonable to assume that the described cove could be a popular tourist destination. without further information, it remains an assumption, not a logical inference."
1865," He wouldn't get much information here, it seemed.",He could get all the information he wanted here.,0,0,True,"step 1: in the premise, 'it seemed' that he wouldn't get much information here. the word 'seemed' indicates a subjective assessment. the hypothesis, on the other hand, asserts that he 'could get all the information he wanted' here. this is a contradictory statement to the premise. however, without further context or information, it's impossible to definitively establish if one statement is factually true or false.step 2: the hypothesis contradicts the premise, as it asserts the opposite of what the premise suggests. therefore, the hypothesis cannot be logically inferred from the premise.step 3: based on the logical reasoning, the hypothesis cannot be inferred from the premise."
1866,A race car sits in the pits.,The car is going fast.,0,0,True,"step 1: a race car sitting in the pits is an object that is not currently moving or in use. the premise describes the state of the car, which is inconsistent with the hypothesis, as the hypothesis suggests that the car is 'going fast'. step 2: the hypothesis contradicts the premise, as the car cannot be both sitting in the pits and going fast at the same time. step 3: based on the logical inconsistency between the premise and hypothesis, the hypothesis is not entailed by the premise."
1867,So that's what it's all about.,That isn't what it's about.,0,0,True,"step 1: in the premise, 'that's what it's all about' implies a statement or explanation of what a certain situation or topic truly represents. the hypothesis, 'that isn't what it's about,' contradicts the premise by stating that the situation or topic does not align with what was previously stated.step 2: the hypothesis cannot be logically inferred from the premise, as it directly contradicts the information presented.step 3: based on the logical reasoning, the hypothesis is not entailed by the premise."
1868,yeah uh well i used to live up in New York and Maryland and i uh i like i like bigger cities i like i like more populated areas because i used to live in Buenos Aires but they have ten million people,I living in big cities because I get to meet many different people.,1,0,False,"step 1: in the premise, the speaker mentions their past experiences of living in new york, maryland, buenos aires, and their preference for bigger, more populated areas. no contradictory information is provided.step 2: the hypothesis suggests that the speaker's reason for living in big cities is to meet many different people. the premise does not directly state this, but it does not contradict the hypothesis. the speaker's preference for populated areas does imply a potential for more encounters with various individuals, which aligns with the hypothesis.step 3: based on the provided information, the hypothesis is not directly entailed by the premise, but it is a reasonable inference that can be drawn from it. the speaker's stated preference for populated areas does suggest a desire for diverse social experiences, which could lead to meeting many different people. therefore, it is plausible that the speaker's reason for living in big cities is to meet many different people, although the premise does not explicitly state this."
1870,But the world is not run for the edification of tourists.,The tourists expected the natives to be just like them.,1,0,False,"step 1: in the premise, it is stated that the world is not run for the edification of tourists. this implies that tourists do not have control or primary influence over the world's affairs. the hypothesis, on the other hand, suggests an expectation or assumption on the part of the tourists about the natives.step 2: the hypothesis does not logically follow from the premise. while there's no direct contradiction, the premise does not provide information about the tourists' thoughts or expectations. the hypothesis makes an assumption about tourists' mindset, which is not explicitly stated or implied in the premise.step 3: based on the logical analysis, the hypothesis is not entailed by the premise."
1871,"On the contrary, it might be simpler for you to pass as an American.","It's harder for everyone to pass as Americans, even for Americans. ",0,0,True,"step 1: in the premise, the speaker is suggesting that it might be easier for someone (implied to be an outsider) to pass as an american. this implies that there are instances where people can successfully blend in with the american culture. in the hypothesis, it is stated that it's harder for everyone to pass as americans. this statement seems to contradict the premise as it implies that passing as an american is difficult for everyone, including americans themselves.step 2: the hypothesis does not logically follow from the premise. while it's true that passing as an american might be difficult for some people due to cultural differences, it's also common sense and a well-established fact that americans can pass as americans. the hypothesis, on the other hand, asserts that it's universally difficult for everyone, including americans, which contradicts the premise.step 3: based on the logical analysis and common sense reasoning, the hypothesis is not entailed by the premise and, in fact, contradicts it."
1872,yeah yeah i like uh what is it on Tuesday oh i think Coach is kind of funny on Tuesday night,I've never seen Coach before and don't plan to.,0,0,True,"step 1: in the premise, the speaker mentions that they find coach funny on tuesday nights. this indicates that the speaker has some interaction or awareness of coach. step 2: the hypothesis, however, states that the speaker has never seen coach before and has no plans to. this directly contradicts the premise, as the speaker cannot find someone funny if they have never seen them before. step 3: based on the logical inconsistency between the premise and hypothesis, and the lack of any information in the premise that would allow for the hypothesis to be inferred, the hypothesis cannot be logically inferred from the premise.step 4: it's important to note that common sense and factual consistency are also crucial in determining logical entailment, and in this case, the hypothesis contradicts the premise, making it a clear case of no entailment."
1873,I dared trust nobody.,"I had been betrayed before, so I found it hard to trust anyone.",1,1,True,"step 1: the premise 'i dared trust nobody' implies a lack of trust or suspicion towards others. this could be due to various reasons, one of which is a past experience of betrayal. step 2: the hypothesis 'i had been betrayed before, so i found it hard to trust anyone' explains the reason behind the lack of trust in the premise. it logically connects the past experience of betrayal with the present inability to trust. step 3: based on this logical connection, the hypothesis can be inferred from the premise as it provides a reasonable explanation for the stated lack of trust."
1874,The band was formed in 2000.,The band was formed in 2000 and stayed active until 2005.,1,1,True,"step 1: in the premise, the band is stated to have been formed in the year 2000. no additional information about the band's activity after formation is provided. step 2: the hypothesis extends the information in the premise by stating that the band was active until 2005. if a band forms and continues to be active, it is reasonable to infer that it exists during the intervening time. no contradictory facts are given. therefore, the hypothesis can be logically inferred from the premise. step 3: based on the logical reasoning, the hypothesis is entailed by the premise."
1875,The Department discusses these comments and any action taken in reaction to them in,The Department does not have any discussion of these comments or the actions taken in response.,0,0,True,"step 1: the premise states that the department discusses the comments and any actions taken in reaction to them. this implies that there is a dialogue or exchange of ideas regarding the comments and their consequences.step 2: the hypothesis states that there is no discussion of the comments or actions taken. this is directly contradictory to the information in the premise.step 3: based on the logical analysis, the hypothesis cannot be inferred from the premise because they are contradictory.step 4: the hypothesis is not entailed by the premise."
1877,"Two men not wearing any pants are sitting next to each other, both reading, on public transportation.",The two men step off the bus.,0,0,True,"step 1: in the premise, we have a scenario where two men are sitting next to each other, reading, on public transportation without pants. this information does not inherently limit their actions or the possible subsequent events. step 2: the hypothesis suggests that the two men step off the bus. while this event is not logically implied in the premise, it is not contradictory either. people often exit buses or other forms of public transportation. step 3: to decide if the hypothesis is entailed by the premise, we need to consider if the hypothesis follows logically or if it introduces new information. in this case, the hypothesis does not logically follow from the premise because the premise does not indicate that the men are getting off the bus. however, it does not contradict the premise either, as the men could be sitting on the bus and then step off at a later point. based on the given information, the hypothesis is not entailed by the premise. "
1878,"Chris Cox, R-Calif., into blaming Democrats for suppressing those findings, Cox shot him  It is not a Democratic party position, because Democrats and Republicans have worked very closely together on this issue.",Chris Cox is a Democrat.,0,0,True,"step 1. in the premise, chris cox is identified as a republican. the sentence also states that cox blamed democrats and shot at a man, but it does not provide any information about the man's political affiliation or the reason for the shooting. step 2. the hypothesis is that chris cox is a democrat. this statement contradicts the information in the premise. step 3. based on the information provided, the hypothesis 'chris cox is a democrat' cannot be logically inferred from the premise 'chris cox, a republican, into blaming democrats for suppressing those findings, cox shot him'. the hypothesis is in fact the opposite of the information in the premise."
1879,"Unfortunately, the statutory 20-day response period passed without any meaningful action by the Office of the Vice President.",The Office of the Vice President took swift and meaningful action.,0,0,True,"step 1: in the premise, it is stated that the 20-day response period passed without any meaningful action by the office of the vice president. this implies that no action was taken during that period that would be considered satisfactory or effective.step 2: the hypothesis states that the office of the vice president took 'swift and meaningful action.' swift action implies that it was taken in a short amount of time, while meaningful action implies that it was substantive and had a positive impact.step 3: the hypothesis contradicts the premise, as the premise states that no meaningful action was taken during the 20-day response period, while the hypothesis asserts that swift and meaningful action was taken. therefore, the hypothesis cannot be logically inferred from the premise.step 4: it is important to note that the lack of information about the reasons for the inaction or the possibility of later action does not change the logical relationship between the premise and hypothesis.step 5: in conclusion, the hypothesis that 'the office of the vice president took swift and meaningful action' is not entailed by the premise that 'unfortunately, the statutory 20-day response period passed without any meaningful action by the office of the vice president'."
1880,"Built for the Pisani doges in 1756, with 200 rooms, Tiepolo frescoes in the ballroom, and vast park with pond, labyrinth, and stables, it was purchased by Napoleon in 1807 and subsequently hosted Tsars, Hapsburg emperors, and, for their first meeting in 1934, Hitler and Mussolini.",Tsar Nicholas stayed in the building built by Napoleon.,1,0,False,"step 1: the premise describes a building with various historical details such as its construction for the pisani doges in 1756, its ownership by napoleon, and its subsequent use by various tsars and hapsburg emperors. it also mentions the presence of tiepolo frescoes, a vast park, and facilities like stables. step 2: the hypothesis suggests that tsar nicholas specifically stayed in this building. step 3: from the information provided in the premise, it can be logically inferred that tsar nicholas could have indeed stayed in the building since it is known to have been used by various tsars according to the premise. however, the premise does not provide sufficient evidence to definitively prove that tsar nicholas was the only tsar who stayed in the building or that he stayed during a specific time. therefore, the hypothesis 'tsar nicholas stayed in the building' is not a logical entailment of the premise 'it was purchased by napoleon and...', but rather a possible inference based on the given context."
1881,It's absurd but I can't help it. Sir James nodded again.,"Sir James thinks it's absurd to feel this way, but can't shake the feeling.",1,1,True,"step 1: in the premise, the statement 'it's absurd but i can't help it' is attributed to an unspecified 'it'. however, based on the context provided, it is reasonable to infer that 'it' refers to sir james' feelings or thoughts. the second part of the premise 'sir james nodded again' indicates that sir james is acknowledging or agreeing with the absurdity of his feelings. step 2: the hypothesis 'sir james thinks it's absurd to feel this way, but can't shake the feeling' is consistent with the information in the premise. it's a common human experience to acknowledge the irrationality of an emotion or belief while still being unable to change it. step 3: based on the logical relationship between the premise and hypothesis, and the common-sense understanding of human emotions and behavior, the hypothesis can be inferred from the premise.step 4: it is also worth noting that while the hypothesis is not an exact synonym of the premise, it can be considered a more specific or elaborated version of the premise. the premise provides a general statement about sir james' feelings and actions, while the hypothesis offers a more detailed description of those feelings. however, the hypothesis does not contradict or add anything inconsistent with the premise, and thus it can be considered a logical entailment.therefore, the label should be: 1"
1882,Paul Haarhuis and Yevgeny Kafelnikov were the defending champions.,"Paul Haarhuis and Yevgeny Kafelnikov were the defending champions, but Kafelnikov chose to not compete this year in order to focus on the singles tournament.",1,0,False,"step 1: in the premise, paul haarhuis and yevgeny kafelnikov are identified as the defending champions in some context. no specific information is given about their participation in the current championship or any reasons for their defense.step 2: the hypothesis adds new information not present in the premise - kafelnikov chose not to compete this year. however, this information does not contradict the premise, as the premise itself does not state that both players competed in the current championship.step 3: the hypothesis does not follow logically from the premise, as the premise does not provide sufficient context to infer that kafelnikov did not compete. logically, the premise alone does not entail the hypothesis.final reasoning and conclusion:the hypothesis is not logically entailed by the premise."
1883,You can stop at the seventh or eighth station to rest en route.,The seventh station has vending machines and walking trails.,1,0,False,"step 1: in the premise, it is mentioned that you can stop at the seventh or eighth station. this suggests that both stations offer some amenities or convenience, such as a place to rest. no specific information is given about the presence or absence of vending machines or walking trails.step 2: the hypothesis suggests that the seventh station specifically has vending machines and walking trails. this is not directly entailed by the premise, as the premise only guarantees that you can stop at the seventh station, not that it has vending machines or walking trails.step 3: based on the given information, the hypothesis cannot be logically inferred from the premise, as the premise does not guarantee the presence of vending machines or walking trails at the seventh station."
1884,oh no yeah right they give us ten minutes uh uh the only advice i give you on college would be there's a lot of scholarship money out there my daughter got a little bit not much only first year she got about two thousand dollars worth,I don't have a daughter. ,0,0,True,"step 1: in the premise, the speaker mentions that they have a daughter and she received a scholarship worth about two thousand dollars. this information is presented as a fact.step 2: the hypothesis directly contradicts the premise by stating that the speaker does not have a daughter. given that the premise states the opposite, the hypothesis cannot be logically inferred from the premise.step 3: based on the logical negation of the contradiction and the given information in the premise, the hypothesis is not entailed by the premise."
1885,"Furthermore, even if complying with abortion restrictions were feasible, You just can't compromise on a principle.",You can compromise on a principal. ,0,0,True,"step 1: the premise expresses a strong belief or stance of the speaker that they 'can't compromise on a principle.' this is a statement about the speaker's values and convictions. the hypothesis, on the other hand, suggests the opposite - that the speaker can compromise on a principle.step 2: a logical contradiction exists between the premise and hypothesis. the premise asserts that compromising on a principle is not an option, while the hypothesis implies that it is. the hypothesis, therefore, cannot be logically inferred from the premise.step 3: based on the logical analysis, the hypothesis is not entailed by the premise."
1886,The Kathmandu Valley itself was raided in 1336 by the Muslim Sultan of Bengal.,The Kathmandu Valley itself was never successfully raided by the Muslim Sultan of Bengal.,0,0,True,"step 1: in the premise, it is stated that the kathmandu valley itself was raided by the muslim sultan of bengal in 1336. this implies an invasion or attack on the kathmandu valley by the muslim sultan. step 2: the hypothesis suggests the opposite: that the kathmandu valley was never successfully raided by the muslim sultan of bengal. in order for this to be a logical inference from the premise, we would need evidence or information that the raid was unsuccessful or did not result in a lasting impact on the kathmandu valley. however, no such information is provided in the premise. step 3: based on the given information, the hypothesis cannot be logically inferred from the premise as the premise does not indicate or suggest that the raid was unsuccessful."
1887,Their music is characterized by a use of complex time signatures.,"Their music is characterized by a use of complex time signatures and heavy, guitar driven sounds.",1,1,True,"step 1: in the premise, it is stated that 'their music is characterized by a use of complex time signatures'. this means that the music in question exhibits the use of complex rhythms or beats. no specific information about the sound or genre of the music is provided. in the hypothesis, 'complex time signatures' is repeated, indicating a continuation of this characteristic. no contradictory information is present.step 2: the hypothesis also introduces a new characteristic, 'heavy, guitar driven sounds'. however, this does not contradict the premise as the premise only describes the use of complex time signatures and does not exclude other musical elements.step 3: the hypothesis can be seen as an expansion of the premise, adding more detail to the description of the music. the use of complex time signatures remains the core characteristic, and the addition of 'heavy, guitar driven sounds' does not change or contradict this. the hypothesis can be reasonably inferred from the premise as it does not alter the original meaning.step 4: based on logical reasoning and a lack of contradictory information, the hypothesis can be inferred from the premise."
1888,you know there are some oaks magnolias and like plum trees peach trees,Plum trees and peach trees are harvested every weekend,1,0,False,"step 1. the premise describes the presence of various tree species, including plum trees and peach trees, without providing any context about their conditions or uses.step 2. the hypothesis suggests that plum trees and peach trees are harvested every weekend. harvesting typically involves the act of removing mature fruits or crops from the trees.step 3. however, the premise does not provide sufficient information to logically infer that plum trees and peach trees are harvested every weekend. the presence of trees does not necessarily imply that they are cultivated or harvested. moreover, the frequency of the harvesting is not mentioned in the premise.step 4. therefore, based on the given information, the hypothesis cannot be logically inferred from the premise."
1889,it's handy,It's not very useful.,0,0,True,"step 1: 'it's handy' is an adjective used to describe something as useful or convenient. 'handy' is a subjective term and doesn't provide specific information about the object or situation. 'it's not very useful' is a negative statement about the usefulness of something.step 2: the hypothesis contradicts the premise because 'it's not very useful' directly opposes the idea that something is 'handy', or useful and convenient.step 3: based on the logical negation of the premise in the hypothesis, the hypothesis is not entailed by the premise."
1890,and so they got they got the meat place and so you just go there and you can't find chicken there you got to go to another place to find the chicken,I've never heard of a meat place that didn't have chicken.,0,0,True,"step 1: in the premise, the speaker describes a situation where they go to a meat place and can't find chicken there. this implies that the meat place did not have chicken available for purchase. step 2: the hypothesis states that the speaker has never heard of a meat place that didn't have chicken. the hypothesis contradicts the premise because the premise explicitly states that the speaker encountered a meat place that did not have chicken. step 3: based on the provided information, the hypothesis is not entailed by the premise."
1891,it's fun for them we take the long route go up Alma and across the back way come in the parking lot,The long route has beautiful trees along the way.,1,1,True,"step 1: in the premise, the speakers are described as taking the long route, going up alma and across the back way, and coming in the parking lot. the phrase 'long route' suggests a journey involving travel over a greater distance than a more direct route. no contradictory information is given.step 2: the hypothesis 'the long route has beautiful trees along the way' is a statement that could reasonably be inferred from the premise. if taking a long route involves passing through an area with beautiful trees, then the hypothesis is a logical consequence of the information given in the premise.step 3: based on the logical connections, common sense, and the absence of contradictory information, the hypothesis can be inferred from the premise."
1892,"And Bellow, too, is putting the finishing touches on a novel titled Ravelstein , about his late friend Allan Bloom, so I had to mention that.",Bellow has written many other novels in the past.,1,1,True,"step 1: in the premise, it is stated that saul bellow is working on a novel called ravelstein about his late friend allan bloom. no information is provided about the number of novels bellow has written before or after ravelstein. however, the premise does mention that bellow is a well-known and acclaimed author. step 2: the hypothesis, 'bellow has written many other novels in the past', is a statement that is entailed by the general knowledge or common sense understanding of bellow being a well-known and acclaimed author. many well-known and acclaimed authors typically have written multiple novels in their careers. step 3: based on the logical reasoning of the premise implying that bellow is a well-known and prolific author, and common sense understanding of what it means to be a well-known and prolific author, the hypothesis can be inferred from the premise."
1893,"We need to look at the implications that these differing roles have for a range of issues, such as SES core competencies, performance standards, recruitment sources, mobility, and training and development programs.",We can completely ignore the implications of the roles on mobility.,0,0,True,"step 1: in the premise, it is mentioned that the implications of roles need to be considered for various issues including mobility. this suggests that the roles have some impact on mobility. step 2: the hypothesis suggests that we can ignore the implications of roles on mobility. however, this directly contradicts the information given in the premise. ignoring the implications of roles on mobility is not a logical or reasonable inference from the premise. step 3: based on the logical principles, common sense, and the contradiction with the premise, the hypothesis is not entailed by the premise."
1895,3 discusses the extent to which the United States has supplemented its saving and investment by borrowing from abroad.,It is surprising how much the United States borrows from foreign nations.,1,0,False,"step 1: the premise states that 3 discusses the extent to which the united states borrows from abroad for supplementing its saving and investment. this implies that the united states engages in borrowing from foreign nations to a significant degree. step 2: the hypothesis expresses surprise at the extent of united states borrowing from foreign nations. surprise is an emotional response, and emotional responses are not inherently logical or factual. however, the hypothesis is not contradictory to the premise and is consistent with its implications. step 3: the hypothesis does not logically follow from the premise, but it could be a reasonable inference based on the premise's contents. the premise indicates a substantial amount of borrowing, which could be surprising to some. common sense and context can influence whether the hypothesis is a reasonable inference or not."
1896,She's a crutch.,"She's an essential, key role in this, and is being used as a crutch.",1,0,False,"step 1: the premise 'she's a crutch' is an idiomatic expression used to indicate that someone or something is relied upon heavily to provide support or assistance. it does not necessarily imply a negative connotation, but rather signifies dependence. step 2: the hypothesis 'she's an essential, key role in this, and is being used as a crutch' does not logically follow the premise. while both statements discuss the role of 'she,' they have different meanings. the hypothesis implies that 'she' is a crucial element, while the premise indicates that 'she' is relied upon. these statements are not equivalent. step 3: based on the logical analysis, the hypothesis cannot be inferred from the premise as they convey distinct meanings."
1897,"But the report, by UC Irvine's School of Social Ecology, said users were overwhelmingly positive about the free legal assistance.",They were not able to afford it otherwise.,1,1,True,"step 1: in the premise, the report mentions that users were 'overwhelmingly positive' about the free legal assistance. this implies that they appreciated and valued the service. it does not provide any direct information about their financial situation or why they might have needed the assistance. however, it's common sense and consistent with general societal understanding that people often seek and appreciate free services, especially when it comes to something as important as legal assistance, which can be expensive.  stephen 2: the hypothesis suggests that users were not able to afford the legal assistance without it being free. while this is not explicitly stated in the premise, it is a reasonable inference that can be made based on the common-sense understanding of people's motivations for seeking and valuing free services. step 3: based on the logical reasoning, common-sense understanding, and lack of contradictory information in the premise, the hypothesis can be inferred from the premise."
1898,"A notice of proposed rulemaking was published on April 15, 1996.",The notice was published online.,1,0,False,"step 1: in the premise, a notice of proposed rulemaking was published on april 15, 1996. the term 'published' refers to the act of making an official document available to the public. no specific medium for publication is mentioned. step 2: the hypothesis proposes that the notice was published online. in 1996, the internet was already in use but its penetration and availability to the public varied significantly. however, 'online' publication implies a digital format, which was not a common medium for official notices at that time. step 3: based on the information given, the hypothesis cannot be logically inferred from the premise. it's possible that the notice was published online, but the premise does not provide sufficient evidence to support that conclusion."
1899,"She released second album, Fem Not opened short of female in English in 1996.","She released second album, Fem (Not opened rose in Turkish or short of female in English) in 1996.",1,1,True,"step 1: in the premise, 'she released second album, fem not opened short of female in english in 1996', 'fem not opened short of female in english' is the title of the second album. the title does not provide any specific meaning that would contradict the hypothesis. 'she released second album' in the premise and 'she released second album, fem (not opened rose in turkish or short of female in english)' in the hypothesis are logically equivalent as they both describe the action of releasing a second album. step 2: the hypothesis 'she released second album, fem (not opened rose in turkish or short of female in english) in 1996' can be logically inferred from the premise 'she released second album, fem not opened short of female in english in 1996'. the title of the second album can be any string of words, so the title 'fem (not opened rose in turkish or short of female in english)' is a valid assumption based on the given information. step 3: based on the logical reasoning and the lack of contradictory information, the hypothesis can be inferred from the premise."
1900,"First they turn all the washboards and jugs into musical instruments, and the next thing you know all the neighborhood crawfish start to disappear.",The crawfish disappeared.,1,1,True,"step 1: in the premise, the transformation of washboards and jugs into musical instruments is mentioned, along with the subsequent disappearance of crawfish. the disappearance of crawfish is not directly stated as the cause, but it is implied. common sense and logical reasoning suggest that the disappearance might be due to the musical instruments or other human activities. step 2: the hypothesis 'the crawfish disappeared' is directly related to the premise, as it is a statement about the same event. the hypothesis can be logically inferred from the premise, as the premise sets the context for the disappearance. step 3: based on the logical connection and common sense reasoning, the hypothesis can be inferred from the premise."
1901,"Flaws in the marble so enraged the artist that he hurled a hammer at it, destroying Christ's left leg the left arm has been restored and the rather insipid Mary Magdalen was later added by a pupil.",The artist later disavowed the marble sculpture and swore off art for the rest of his life.,1,0,False,"step 1: in the premise, the artist is described as being enraged by the flaws in the marble sculpture of christ. this emotion and the destructive action he took suggest a deep dissatisfaction or disappointment with the piece. however, the premise also mentions that the artist's pupil later restored one of christ's arms and added mary magdalen. this contradicts the notion of the artist completely abandoning art for the rest of his life because there is evidence of his continued involvement in the artistic process. step 2: the hypothesis cannot be logically inferred from the premise as there is no information provided in the premise to support the artist's disavowal of all art and his subsequent abandonment of it. step 3: based on the logical analysis and the contradiction between the premise and hypothesis, the hypothesis is not entailed by the premise."
1902,A man in a green Celtic sleeveless jersey shirt and short stone washed jean shorts sitting and eating.,The man is wearing a Cowboys jersey.,0,0,True,"step 1. the premise describes a man's appearance with specific articles of clothing: a green celtic sleeveless jersey shirt and short stone washed jean shorts. this information is factual and consistent. step 2. the hypothesis suggests a different jersey brand, cowboys, but it does not contradict the information in the premise. however, the premise does not provide enough information to logically infer or entail the hypothesis. step 3. based on the available information, the hypothesis cannot be logically inferred from the premise."
1903,All centers are affiliated with one of the major certifying bodies.,All centers are independent.,0,0,True,"step 1: in the premise, 'all centers' are described as being affiliated with one of the major certifying bodies. this means that each center has a formal relationship or membership with one of these organizations. step 2: the hypothesis states that 'all centers are independent.' the term 'independent' implies that the centers operate without external control or influence. these two statements are contradictory because if a center is affiliated with a certifying body, it is not fully independent since it is subject to the body's rules and regulations. step 3: based on the logical inconsistency between the premise and hypothesis, the hypothesis cannot be logically inferred from the premise."
1904,"She also won the girls ' doubles silver medal, and gold medals in the mixed team and doubles event.","She also competed at the Asian Junior Championships, and won the girls' doubles silver medal, and gold medals in the mixed team and doubles event.",1,1,True,"step 1: in the premise, it is stated that she won several medals in various events at some tournament. the hypothesis also mentions that she won medals at the asian junior championships in the same events. there is no contradictory information in the premise that would prevent the hypothesis from being true.step 2: the hypothesis can be logically inferred from the premise because if someone wins medals in certain events at one tournament, it is a reasonable assumption that they participated in those events at that tournament. the hypothesis adds the specific detail that the tournament was the asian junior championships, but this detail does not contradict the premise and only provides additional context.step 3: based on the logical reasoning and the lack of contradictory information, the hypothesis can be inferred from the premise."
1905,For example key assumptions underlying the Base and Alternative Estimates for the mortality category include the  (1) Inhalation of fine particles is causally associated with premature death at concentrations near those experienced by most Americans on a daily basis.,The Base and Alternative Estimates does not make any assumptions.,0,0,True,"step 1: in the premise, it is explicitly stated that there are key assumptions underlying the base and alternative estimates for the mortality category. one of these assumptions is that inhalation of fine particles is causally associated with premature death at concentrations near those experienced by most americans on a daily basis. step 2: the hypothesis, however, denies this, stating that the base and alternative estimates do not make any assumptions. this directly contradicts the information given in the premise. step 3: based on the information in the premise, the hypothesis cannot be logically inferred as it contradicts the premise.step 4: it's important to note that the absence of assumptions is not explicitly stated in the premise. instead, the premise discusses one of the assumptions. the hypothesis is about the absence of assumptions in general. this is a significant difference and highlights the importance of understanding the meaning and scope of the information provided in both the premise and hypothesis.therefore, the hypothesis cannot be logically inferred from the premise."
1906,The Edinburgh Crystal Factory has guided tours that show every aspect of the production of cut lead glassware.,The factory is very private when it comes to the production of glassware.,0,0,True,"step 1: in the premise, it is stated that the edinburgh crystal factory offers guided tours that allow visitors to see every aspect of the production of cut lead glassware. this implies transparency and openness about the manufacturing process. step 2: the hypothesis, 'the factory is very private when it comes to the production of glassware', contradicts the information provided in the premise. there is no evidence or implication in the premise that the factory is private. thefactory's openness to guided tours indicates the opposite. step 3: based on the logical analysis and the clear contradiction between the premise and hypothesis, the hypothesis is not entailed by the premise."
1907,yeah i'll try that i sure will,I will probably try that next week,1,1,True,"step 1: in the premise, the speaker expresses an intention to 'try that', but the exact time is not specified. in the hypothesis, the speaker is stated to 'probably try that next week'. step 2: the hypothesis can be logically inferred from the premise if it is understood that 'trying that next week' is a possible and reasonable implication of 'i will try that'. it is common sense that people often make plans to do things, but circumstances may cause delays. thus, the hypothesis is a reasonable assumption based on the information in the premise. step 3: based on the logical reasoning and common sense understanding, the hypothesis can be inferred from the premise."
1908,i haven't seen it in a long time but Sesame Street is still really good,Some children's shows are just classics.,1,1,True,"step 1: in the premise, the speaker expresses their personal opinion that they haven't seen sesame street for a long time but still believe it to be good. this implies that sesame street is a children's show that has stood the test of time and continues to be appreciated. no contradictory information is presented.step 2: the hypothesis states that some children's shows are 'just classics.' this is a reasonable inference that could be drawn from the premise, as sesame street is being described as a classic children's show. the hypothesis is not a contradiction of the premise.step 3: based on the given information and logical reasoning, the hypothesis can be inferred from the premise. it is a generalization based on the specific example of sesame street given in the premise."
1909,"Sadly, only numbers 14 and 26 are still in their original state.",Fourteen is crumbling but twenty-six is standing strong.  ,1,0,False,"step 1: in the premise, it is stated that only numbers 14 and 26 are still in their original state. this implies that all other numbers have undergone some change. the premise does not provide any information about the current state of numbers 14 and 26 or what 'original state' means.  step 2: the hypothesis posits that number 14 is crumbling while number 26 remains standing strong. this is not an implication of the premise, as the premise does not provide enough information to logically infer the current state of each number. step 3: based on the given information, the hypothesis cannot be logically inferred from the premise."
1910,MEASUREMENT,Measure first,1,0,False,"step 1. the premise does not provide sufficient context or information for making an inference. it is a general instruction to 'measure'. the hypothesis, 'measure first', seems to be repeating the same instruction.step 2. without any specific relationship or connection between the premise and hypothesis, we cannot logically infer one from the other. the hypothesis does not provide any new information that can be deduced from the premise.step 3. based on the lack of logical connection and the repetition of the instruction, the hypothesis cannot be inferred from the premise."
1912,"Where feasible, these areas were addressed or clarified in the final standards in this Statement.",There were several areas that could not be clarified because it was not feasible.,1,1,True,"step 1: in the premise, it is stated that 'where feasible, these areas were addressed or clarified' in the final standards. this implies that there might be some areas where clarification or addressing was not feasible. the hypothesis suggests that 'there were several areas that could not be clarified' due to it not being feasible. both the premise and hypothesis describe situations where it was not feasible to clarify or address certain areas.step 2: the hypothesis can be logically inferred from the premise because the premise acknowledges the existence of areas that could not be addressed or clarified, and the hypothesis specifies that 'there were several' such areas. the hypothesis is a specific instance of the more general situation described in the premise.step 3: based on the logical relationship between the premise and hypothesis, and the lack of contradictory information, the hypothesis can be inferred from the premise."
1913,they have got two log cabin shelters that are basically uh four walls and a roof log cabins with a concrete floor and a picnic table in them and a ceiling fan and screened uh windows,Log cabins are simple but they are comfortable.,1,1,True,"step 1: the premise describes two log cabins, which are defined as having four walls, a roof, a concrete floor, a picnic table, a ceiling fan, and screened windows. this information implies that the log cabins are simple structures but also provide comfort with the inclusion of a concrete floor, a picnic table, and modern amenities like a ceiling fan. step 2: the hypothesis, 'log cabins are simple but they are comfortable,' is consistent with and can be inferred from the premise. the premise establishes that log cabins are simple structures, and the hypothesis adds that they are also comfortable. the comfort aspect is suggested by the presence of a concrete floor, picnic table, and ceiling fan in the log cabins described in the premise. step 3: based on the logical reasoning and the consistency of the hypothesis with the premise, the hypothesis can be inferred from the premise."
1914,oh yes i didn't get a chance to see that,I really wish I had seen that last time it was here.,1,1,True,"step 1: in the premise, the speaker expresses regret about not having had the opportunity to see something the last time it was present. this implies that the speaker values seeing the thing in question. step 2: in the hypothesis, the speaker expresses a desire to have seen the same thing the last time it was there. this wish is consistent with the regret expressed in the premise, suggesting that the hypothesis can be logically inferred. step 3: based on the consistent and logical relationship between the premise and hypothesis, the hypothesis can be inferred from the premise.step 4: it's also important to note that the premise does not provide enough information to determine exactly what the speaker is referring to when they say 'that' or 'it', but the hypothesis makes it clear that the speaker is referring to the same thing."
1916,"And the idea is a good one, yes.",The idea is bad.,0,0,True,"step 1: the premise expresses agreement with an idea being good. no specific information about the idea or the context is provided that could be used to logically derive that it is bad. step 2: the hypothesis contradicts the premise by stating that the idea is bad. however, the lack of further context or details in the premise makes it impossible to logically infer that the hypothesis is true based on the premise alone. step 3: given the limited information, and the contradictory nature of the hypothesis and the premise, it is not possible to determine if the hypothesis is entailed by the premise or not.step 4: in real-life scenarios, the evaluation of an idea as good or bad often depends on various factors such as context, consequences, and personal values, which are not captured in the given premise or hypothesis. therefore, without more context or information, it would not be reasonable or accurate to infer that the hypothesis is a logical consequence of the premise."
1917,yep because it's when it's self propelled it's heavy yeah,it's very light when it's self propelled,0,0,True,"step 1. the premise 'yep because it's when it's self propelled it's heavy' describes a property of an object when it is self-propelled, stating that it is heavy. step 2. the hypothesis 'it's very light when it's self propelled' contradicts the premise by stating that the object is very light instead of heavy. step 3. the hypothesis cannot be logically inferred from the premise since it contradicts the key information provided in the premise."
1918,"Don't mean the police, but the people that are right in it. ",The police were overt brutal. ,1,0,False,"step 1: the premise is a colloquial expression that means 'those directly involved' or 'the individuals concerned'. it does not provide any specific information about the nature of their actions or behavior. the hypothesis, on the other hand, asserts that the 'people' in question were 'overtly brutal'. step 2: the hypothesis cannot be logically inferred from the premise because the premise does not provide sufficient context or information to support the conclusion of the hypothesis. the premise does not indicate that the 'people' referred to are the police, nor does it provide any evidence of 'overt brutality'. step 3: based on the given information, the hypothesis is not entailed by the premise."
1919,"While it is easy to see how infuriating such a pose must be to others, offensiveness in the service of subjective truth has its place here.",Posing in a provocative way may make people feel uncomfortable.,1,1,True,"step 1: in the premise, the speaker acknowledges that taking a provocative pose can be infuriating to others. this implies that such a pose can elicit negative emotions or discomfort. step 2: the hypothesis is consistent with the premise as it also suggests that a provocative pose can make people feel uncomfortable. this is a logical consequence of the premise, as the speaker in the premise acknowledges the potential for offense. step 3: based on this analysis, the hypothesis is a logical entailment of the premise."
1920,"Building on last year's grant, the TIG 2002 award to Potomac Legal Aid Society (PLAS) allows the program to reach the area's underserved Asian American community.","Building on last year's grant, more and more money was put into the fund",1,0,False,"step 1: in the premise, it is stated that the tig 2002 award builds on last year's grant, indicating that there is continuity in funding. the premise also mentions that the program uses this funding to reach the underserved asian american community. no information in the premise contradicts the hypothesis.step 2: the hypothesis 'more and more money was put into the fund' does not directly contradict or follow from the information provided in the premise. however, it is a reasonable assumption based on the premise's context. the use of the phrase 'building on last year's grant' suggests an increase or continuation in funding, making the hypothesis plausible.step 3: based on the context, logical reasoning, and lack of contradictory information, the hypothesis 'more and more money was put into the fund' can be considered a reasonable inference from the premise, even though it is not explicitly stated."
1921,yeah i know the guy at Wolfe told us they cut back on the tree warranty like six months or less,The guy at Wolfe said that the tree warranty was longer than six months.  ,0,0,True,"step 1: the premise states that the guy at wolfe told you that the tree warranty is 'like six months or less'. this implies that the guy at wolfe communicated that the warranty duration is shorter than a year, but the exact length is uncertain. step 2: the hypothesis, on the other hand, suggests that the guy at wolfe stated that the warranty was longer than six months. this contradicts the information in the premise. step 3: based on the given information, it is not logically possible to infer the hypothesis from the premise. the hypothesis proposes a fact that contradicts the one stated in the premise."
1922,nonstop have you have you ever been out here,I am somewhat certain that you have been here before.,1,1,True,"step 1: in the premise, 'nonstop have you have you ever been out here', the speaker is asking the listener if they have been to a specific place before, repeatedly. this implies a question about the listener's past experiences or visits.step 2: the hypothesis, 'i am somewhat certain that you have been here before', suggests that the speaker has reason to believe the listener has visited the place before. this belief can be logically inferred from the question in the premise, as the question itself implies that the speaker has some level of suspicion or knowledge that the listener may have been there before.step 3: based on the logical connection between the premise and hypothesis, and the lack of contradictory information, the hypothesis can be inferred from the premise. the premise sets up the context for the hypothesis and provides the necessary background information for the speaker to make the inference."
1923,"But over the course of a generation, activists and bureaucrats have manufactured a single race out of a diverse mass of several million people whose origins can be traced to dozens of countries.",All races can be traced to Africa.,1,1,True,"step 1: in the premise, the statement is made that several million people, whose origins can be traced to dozens of countries, have been manufactured into a single race. this implies that the concept of 'race' is a social construct, not based on factual or biological differences. step 2: the hypothesis proposes that all races can be traced to africa. this is a well-known and widely accepted fact in anthropology and human genetics. most current evidence suggests that all modern humans share a common ancestry in africa, which is the cradle of humanity. step 3: given that the premise acknowledges that race is a social construct and that the hypothesis is a well-established fact in anthropology and human genetics, it is a logical inference that can be made from the premise.step 4: the hypothesis is entailed by the premise, as the premise acknowledges the historical and social construction of race, while the hypothesis states a fact about our shared biological heritage."
1924,I had some warm moments in that court; I did not figure to myself that the man would be so pig-headed as to refuse to say anything at all. ,The court made me refuse to say anything.,1,0,False,"step 1: in the premise, the speaker is expressing surprise that the man did not speak at all, despite the speaker having had 'warm moments' in the court. this suggests a context where both the speaker and the man were expected to make statements or arguments. however, the premise does not specify who caused the speaker to not speak.step 2: the hypothesis suggests an alternative explanation, stating that the court made the speaker refuse to say anything. this implies a coercive or restrictive environment, which is not suggested in the premise.step 3: based on the given information, the hypothesis cannot be logically inferred from the premise as there is no evidence in the premise to support the claim that the court was responsible for the speaker's silence.step 4: it is also important to note that the premise and hypothesis are not contradictory, as the speaker's silence could be attributed to various causes – including the man's refusal to speak as stated in the premise or the court's intervention as suggested in the hypothesis. however, the absence of evidence in the premise for the hypothesis to be a logical inference leaves us with a 'no entailment' conclusion."
1925,That was the information I have.,That was not any of the information I have.,0,0,True,"step 1: analyzing the given premise, it is a declarative sentence stating that 'that was the information i have'. this sentence is describing a situation where the speaker has certain information.step 2: the hypothesis states that 'that was not any of the information i have'. this is contradicting the premise since the premise is stating that 'that' refers to the information the speaker has, while the hypothesis is denying that 'that' (i.e., the information) was among the things the speaker had.step 3: based on the logical analysis, the hypothesis cannot be inferred from the premise since the hypothesis contradicts the information provided in the premise."
1926,yeah i've noticed locally a major problem is Kodak um it's interesting because in order to uh keep with the EPA standards which which tend to be visible uh what's coming out of your  smokestack they do all their emissions at night uh so people get up,I wished that Kodak cared about our environment more.,1,0,False,"step 1: the premise describes a situation where kodak engages in emissions activities at night to meet epa standards, which is a way of complying with regulations but may not be perceived positively due to it being done at night. this information does not contradict the hypothesis, as the hypothesis is not about the specific actions kodak takes but rather an expression of desire for kodak to have greater environmental concern.step 2: the hypothesis does not follow directly from the premise, as the premise does not provide any evidence or information about kodak's actual environmental practices or attitudes. it is a subjective statement about what the speaker wishes for kodak to do.step 3: based on the given information, the hypothesis cannot be logically inferred from the premise, as the premise does not contain sufficient details about kodak's environmental practices or intentions to support the hypothesis."
1927,"He is the keeper of the Beatles' flame, says the New York Times ' Bob Spitz, and has handled megastardom with level-headedness and acumen.",Success has gone to his head,0,0,True,"step 1: in the premise, bob spitz describes the individual as the 'keeper of the beatles' flame' and praises him for handling megastardom with 'level-headedness and acumen.' this implies that the person has successfully managed the responsibility and fame associated with the beatles. however, it does not provide enough information to determine if success has changed him negatively or given him an inflated ego.step 2: the hypothesis, 'success has gone to his head,' suggests that the person's behavior or attitude has become negatively affected by their success. this is not an inherently logical conclusion from the premise. while there's no clear contradiction, the premise does not provide enough evidence to support the hypothesis.step 3: based on the available information, the hypothesis 'success has gone to his head' is not logically entailed by the premise 'he is the keeper of the beatles' flame, says the new york times ' bob spitz, and has handled megastardom with level-headedness and acumen.'"
1928,"The Commission concludes that this reading of the statute would essentially bar LSC representation of this class of aliens and leave H-2A workers without meaningful representation on their employment contract claims, directly contrary to Congress' express purpose.",The Commission has not yet reached any conclusions.,0,0,True,"step 1: in the premise, the commission is stated to have reached a conclusion that barring lsc representation for a specific class of aliens would be contrary to congress' express purpose and leave h-2a workers without meaningful representation. step 2: in contrast, the hypothesis suggests that the commission has not yet reached any conclusions. the hypothesis contradicts the information provided in the premise. step 3: based on the provided information, the hypothesis is not logically entailed by the premise."
1929,Ear irrigation?,Nose-hair pulling,0,0,True,"step 1. the premise 'ear irrigation' refers to a medical procedure used to clean the ear of excess earwax or debris. it involves the use of water, a syringe, or other irrigation tools. the hypothesis 'nose-hair pulling' is an entirely different action, referring to the act of pulling or plucking nose hairs.step 2. there is no logical connection between the premise and hypothesis. ear irrigation is a medical procedure performed on the ear, while nose-hair pulling is an action performed on the nose.step 3. the hypothesis 'nose-hair pulling' cannot be logically inferred from the premise 'ear irrigation'. they are unrelated actions."
1930,The rule provides the main regulatory framework for the National Low Emission Vehicle program and creates the means whereby automobile and light-duty truck manufacturers can volunteer to comply with tailpipe standards that are more strict than EPA can mandate at this time.,The rule does more than provide the main regulatory framework for the National Low Emission Vehicle program and create the means whereby automobile and light-duty truck manufacturers can volunteer to comply with tailpipe standards. ,1,0,False,"step 1: in the premise, it is clear that the rule sets up the structure and guidelines for the national low emission vehicle program and allows manufacturers to voluntarily comply with stricter tailpipe standards. this is the main function of the rule.step 2: the hypothesis suggests that the rule has additional aspects or functions. however, the premise does not contradict the hypothesis, as it is possible that the rule does indeed have more functions beyond what is mentioned in the premise. the hypothesis is not necessarily false, but it also does not follow directly from the premise.step 3: the hypothesis is not entailed by the premise because the premise does not provide enough detail to infer all of the potential functions of the rule. the hypothesis might be true, but more information would be required to make that determination with confidence.step 4: based on the given information, it is not possible to definitively determine if the hypothesis is entailed by the premise or not.label: 0"
1931,"Increased saving and investing can lead to greater economic growth, and a larger economy in turn would mean higher real wages, resulting in more government revenue to pay benefits.","Large economies are the result of increased saving, investing and spending.",1,1,True,"step 1: in the premise, it is stated that increased saving and investing can lead to greater economic growth, and a larger economy would result in higher real wages and more government revenue. this implies a causal relationship between saving/investing, economic growth, and a larger economy. step 2: the hypothesis suggests a similar relationship but in reverse order: a larger economy leads to increased saving, investing, and spending. while the order is different, the logical connection is the same as in the premise. both statements describe the interplay between saving/investing, economic growth, and a larger economy. step 3: based on the logical consistency between the premise and hypothesis and the fact that they both describe the same underlying economic relationships, the hypothesis can be inferred from the premise."
1932,"He has two law partners, Lori Mannicci and Linda Gardner.",He has known these partners for almost a decade.,1,1,True,"step 1: in the premise, it is stated that lori mannicci and linda gardner are law partners of the person in question. this information does not provide any details about the length of their partnership or when they first met. step 2: the hypothesis suggests that the partnership between lori mannicci, linda gardner, and the person in question has lasted for almost a decade. this is a reasonable inference from the premise, as the fact that they are partners implies a certain level of familiarity and longevity in their working relationship. step 3: based on the given information and the common sense assumption that long-term partnerships often imply a significant amount of time working together, the hypothesis can be inferred from the premise.step 4: it is also worth noting that there is no contradictory information in the premise that would prevent the hypothesis from being true. the premise does not mention the date when lori mannicci, linda gardner, and the person became partners, and it is possible, even likely, that their partnership has lasted for almost a decade. therefore, the hypothesis is consistent with the information provided in the premise.therefore, the hypothesis can be reasonably inferred from the premise."
1933,"What's truly striking, though, is that Jobs has never really let this idea go.",Jobs clung to the idea of expanding at all costs.,1,1,True,"step 1: in the premise, it is mentioned that jobs 'has never really let this idea go', referring to the idea of expanding at all costs. this implies that jobs has held on to this notion for a long time and has not abandoned it. step 2: the hypothesis 'jobs clung to the idea of expanding at all costs' is a more direct and explicit statement of jobs' actions regarding the idea mentioned in the premise. since the premise describes jobs' behavior and the hypothesis is a logical extension of that behavior, it can be inferred from the premise. step 3: based on the logical connection between the premise and hypothesis, common sense understanding of the given information, and the absence of contradictory facts, the hypothesis can be inferred from the premise."
1934,"The harbor's entrances were protected by the Pharoseighthouse, one of the Seven Wonders of the World.",The only thing we know about the Pharoseighthouse is that it was one of the Seven Wonders of the World.,0,0,True,"step 1: in the premise, we are told that the pharoseighthouse, one of the seven wonders of the world, protected the harbor's entrances. this implies that the pharoseighthouse had a significant role in the protection of the harbor. step 2: the hypothesis only asserts that we know the pharoseighthouse was one of the seven wonders of the world. it does not mention any other information about the pharoseighthouse or its functions. step 3: although the hypothesis does not contradict the premise, it does not provide enough information to be logically inferred from it. the premise tells us that the pharoseighthouse had a protective function, but the hypothesis does not mention this function or anything else that would logically follow from it. step 4: therefore, based on the information given, the hypothesis cannot be logically inferred from the premise."
1935,"Israel's boundaries were redrawn and expanded to almost what they are now, whereas the Palestinian Arab territories were reduced to the central-eastern area, known as the West Bank (of the Jordan River), and the Gaza Strip.",Israel won the war and got land from it.,1,1,True,"step 1: in the premise, it is stated that israel's boundaries were redrawn and expanded, and palestinian arab territories were reduced. this implies a conflict or change in borders, which typically occurs during a war. it is a well-known historical fact that israel has been involved in several wars over the years. step 2: the hypothesis, 'israel won the war and got land from it,' is logically consistent with the premise. winning a war results in territorial gains, as described in the premise. step 3: based on the logical connection between the premise and hypothesis, common sense understanding of historical conflicts, and factual consistency, the hypothesis is entailed by the premise."
1936,"PEORIA - Prairie State Legal Services Inc. of Peoria managing attorney Lisa Y. Wilson vows that poor central Illinoisans will continue to have free lawyers to assist them, despite funding cuts.",There is nothing that Lisa Wilson can do to help the poor central Illinoisans.,0,0,True,"step 1: in the premise, lisa wilson is stated to be the managing attorney of prairie state legal services inc. in peoria. she is also mentioned as vowing to continue helping the poor central illinoisans despite funding cuts. this implies that she has a role in providing free legal assistance to the said group. step 2: the hypothesis directly contradicts the premise as it suggests that lisa wilson is unable to help the poor central illinoisans. however, the premise contains no information that supports the hypothesis. step 3: based on the logical reasoning and the given information, the hypothesis is not entailed by the premise."
1937,"Since time immemorial, the volcanic soil has produced a profusion of tomatoes, olives, walnuts, grapes, oranges, lemons, and figs.","Tomatoes, olives, walnuts, grapes, oranges, lemons, and figs can not grow in the volcanic soil.",0,0,True,"step 1: in the premise, it is stated that since ancient times, the volcanic soil has produced a variety of fruits including tomatoes, olives, walnuts, grapes, oranges, lemons, and figs. this implies that these fruits naturally grow in the volcanic soil and thrive under its conditions. step 2: the hypothesis states that these same fruits cannot grow in the volcanic soil. this directly contradicts the information given in the premise. step 3: based on the logical reasoning, it is clear that the hypothesis cannot be inferred from the premise as the hypothesis contradicts the facts stated in the premise."
1938,"Timbuktu is a 1959 American black-and-white adventure film set in Timbuktu (Africa) but filmed in the Coral Pink Sand Dunes State Park in Kanab, Utah.","Timbuktu is a 1959 American black-and-white adventure film set in Timbuktu (Africa) but filmed in the Coral Pink Sand Dunes State Park in Born, Utah.",0,0,True,"step 1: the premise establishes that 'timbuktu' is a 1959 american black-and-white adventure film set in timbuktu, africa, but filmed in coral pink sand dunes state park in kanab, utah. the hypothesis proposes the same factual information about the film, but with a slight error in the location of the filming. step 2: the hypothesis does not logically follow from the premise due to the discrepancy in the location. while both utah and born are countries with locations that could potentially be suitable for filming, the premise specifies kanab, utah, and the hypothesis proposes born, which is not mentioned in the premise. step 3: based on the given information, the hypothesis is not logically entailed by the premise as it introduces an incorrect detail."
1939,It twirled over her head and the sword swinger ducked as well.,Someone was nearly killed.,1,1,True,"step 1: in the premise, we have the image of a sword being twirled over someone's head and the sword swinger ducking in response. this scene suggests a dangerous situation, as twirling a sword above one's head carries the risk of accidental injury or even death.step 2: the hypothesis suggests that someone nearly experienced death. this is a reasonable inference from the premise as the dangerous situation described in the premise could have easily led to someone being killed.step 3: based on the logical reasoning that a dangerous situation described in the premise could have resulted in death, and the common sense understanding that someone nearly being killed implies a near-death experience, the hypothesis can be inferred from the premise."
1940,a worm a cut worm not a grub worm,It looks like a night crawler worm. ,1,1,True,"step 1: a cut worm is a type of earthworm that has been cut in half, which exposes its insides. this does not change the fact that it is still an earthworm, specifically a type of earthworm known as a lumbriculus terrestris. nightcrawlers are also a type of earthworm, specifically the largest and most commonly used earthworm for fishing. both cut worms and nightcrawlers belong to the same taxonomic class (annelida), order (annelida), and family (lumbricidae).step 2: the hypothesis does not contradict the premise, as a nightcrawler is indeed a type of earthworm. the description of the worm 'looking like' a nightcrawler does not change its inherent nature as a cut worm.step 3: based on the logical equivalence of the two types of earthworms, the hypothesis 'it looks like a nightcrawler worm' can be inferred from the premise 'a worm, a cut worm, not a grub worm'."
1941,The demon gripped out with its other arm and buried its claws into the man's shoulder.,The man let out a scream when the claws sunk in.,1,1,True,"step 1: in the premise, we have the action of a demon gripping and burying its claws into a man's shoulder. this is a violent and painful event, and it is common sense that such an action would cause significant discomfort or pain, leading to a scream. step 2: the hypothesis 'the man let out a scream when the claws sunk in' is a direct consequence of the premise, as the man's scream is an expected and logical response to the described pain. step 3: based on the logical connection between the premise and hypothesis, and the common-sense understanding of human reactions to pain, the hypothesis can be inferred from the premise.step 4: it is important to note that the premise does not explicitly state that the man screamed, but the hypothesis is still logically entailed by the premise."
1942,"This odd but attractive town-house, with its collection of Arawak and Carib relics, was on display at the 1889 Paris Exposition, then dismantled, brought to Martinique, and reconstructed.",The town-house was displayed at the 1989 Paris Exposition. ,0,0,True,"step 1: in the premise, the town-house is stated to have been on display at the 1889 paris exposition. this information provides a clear temporal context for the town-house's display. step 2: the hypothesis proposes a different year for the display, 1989, which contradicts the information in the premise. step 3: given the contradictory information, the hypothesis cannot be logically inferred from the premise. the premise specifies a definitive year for the display, which is not mentioned or implied in the hypothesis."
1943,"When he jokingly responded with girls, the investigators did not conceal their shocked disapproval.","His response of girls did not shock the investigators; in fact, it was to be expected.",0,0,True,"step 1: in the premise, it is stated that investigators showed shocked disapproval when the person made a jokingly inappropriate response with 'girls'. this implies that the investigators found the response unexpected and inappropriate. step 2: the hypothesis suggests that the investigators did not find the person's response shocking and even expected it. this contradicts the information provided in the premise. step 3: based on the given information and common-sense reasoning, the hypothesis is not entailed by the premise, as the premise indicates that the investigators were shocked, while the hypothesis states they were not."
1944,"The David Lee Roth Band was an American rock band, formed in Pasadena, California in 1985 by Van Halen frontman David Lee Roth.","The David Lee Roth Band was an American rock and roll band, formed in Pasadena, California in 1985 by Van Halen frontman David Lee Roth.",1,1,True,"step 1: both the premise and hypothesis describe the same band, the david lee roth band, formed in pasadena, california in 1985 by van halen frontman david lee roth. the terms 'american rock band' and 'american rock and roll band' are synonymous in this context, as they both refer to bands that originate from the united states and play rock or rock and roll music. step 2: the hypothesis is a more specific version of the premise, providing an additional descriptive term ('rock and roll') for the genre of the band's music. since the hypothesis is a more detailed version of the premise and does not contradict it in any way, it can be logically inferred. step 3: based on the logical reasoning and the equivalence of the terms 'american rock band' and 'american rock and roll band', the hypothesis is a logical entailment of the premise."
1945,"The response has led me to believe its going to be much higher than that, Wagonheim said. ",The response was bigger than Wagonheim expected.,1,1,True,"step 1: in the premise, wagonheim expresses surprise by stating that the response is 'going to be much higher than that'. this implies that wagonheim initially had an expectation that was lower than what he now believes the response will be.step 2: the hypothesis, 'the response was bigger than wagonheim expected', is consistent with the information in the premise. wagonheim's statement suggests that the response is larger than he anticipated, and that is exactly what the hypothesis states.step 3: based on the logical connection between the premise and hypothesis, and the lack of contradictory information, the hypothesis can be inferred from the premise."
1946,Patricia Perry believed that the recommendation was not yet comprehensive.,Ms. Perry believed otherwise in regards to the recommendation.,1,0,False,"step 1: the premise states that patricia perry held a belief that the recommendation was not yet comprehensive. this implies that she thought the recommendation was incomplete or needed more work. step 2: the hypothesis suggests a contrasting belief, that ms. perry believed otherwise regarding the recommendation. this does not logically contradict the premise, as it is possible for someone to hold both the belief that something needs work and the belief that it is adequate or complete in certain respects. step 3: based on the given information, the hypothesis cannot be logically inferred from the premise, as the premise does not indicate that ms. perry held any belief to the contrary of 'the recommendation being not yet comprehensive'. the hypothesis represents a different belief, not a logical consequence of the premise."
1947,The teams are assisted by 60 kids who snitch on their peers.,The teams would not be able to win otherwise.,1,0,False,"step 1: in the premise, it is stated that 60 kids are assisting the teams. this information does not provide any indication of the kids' roles or why they are assisting the teams. it could be that they are providing support in various ways, such as offering strategic advice, fetching supplies, or performing tasks. none of this information implies that the kids are snitching on their peers to the extent that it would prevent the teams from winning.step 2: the hypothesis, 'the teams would not be able to win otherwise,' is a significant leap from the information provided in the premise. it is not logically entailed that the teams could not have won without the kids' assistance, even if that assistance includes snitching. winning a competition can depend on many factors, and the presence or absence of information about peers' actions is just one potential factor.step 3: based on the given information, it is not reasonable to infer that the hypothesis is a logical consequence of the premise."
1948,He wore a tan skin tunic with sleeves down to his forearms.,His arms were bare and he was naked.,0,0,True,"step 1: in the premise, it is stated that he wore a tan skin tunic with sleeves. this information describes what he was wearing on his upper body. no information is provided about his arms being bare or him being naked. common sense and logical reasoning suggest that wearing a tunic with sleeves down to his forearms is inconsistent with having bare arms. moreover, the statement 'he was naked' is a strong claim that goes beyond the information provided in the premise.step 2: the hypothesis 'his arms were bare and he was naked' cannot be logically inferred from the premise because the hypothesis contradicts the information provided in the premise. while the hypothesis can be inferred that his arms were bare based on the description of the tunic sleeves, the additional claim 'he was naked' goes beyond the information provided in the premise.step 3: based on the logical analysis, the hypothesis 'his arms were bare and he was naked' cannot be inferred from the given premise, as the hypothesis contains an additional, unsupported claim."
1950,"If a large portion of our population has no access to the third tier of government, they're basically ostracized.","If a lot of people in our population don't have access to the third tier of government, they will be just fine.",0,0,True,"step 1. the premise states that if a large portion of a population has no access to the third tier of government, they are ostracized. this implies that the third tier of government is important for the population's inclusion and participation in society. step 2. the hypothesis states that if a lot of people in a population don't have access to the third tier of government, they will be just fine. this directly contradicts the premise, as the hypothesis asserts that the lack of access to the third tier of government does not result in ostracism. step 3. based on the logical analysis, the hypothesis cannot be inferred from the premise as it contradicts the premise's core assertion."
1951,He says men are here.,He told us that the soldiers had arrived. ,1,1,True,"step 1: the premise states that 'he says men are here.' this implies that there is a speaker who is making an assertion about the presence of men. the speaker's statement is a piece of information, and it does not specify the context or the identity of the men. step 2: the hypothesis 'he told us that the soldiers had arrived' suggests that the speaker made a statement about soldiers having arrived. this is a specific type of men, and the use of 'told us' implies that the information was communicated to others. the presence of soldiers is a type of 'men' that could be encompassed by the premise. step 3: based on the information in the premise and the logical implications of the hypothesis, the hypothesis can be inferred from the premise. this is because the presence of soldiers is a type of 'men', and the hypothesis states that the speaker communicated this information to others. therefore, the speaker's statement 'men are here' in the premise can entail the more specific statement 'soldiers have arrived' in the hypothesis."
1952,A man napping on the ground with a shirt over his eyes with a person standing beside him.,A sleeping man.,1,1,True,"step 1: in the premise, a man is described as napping with a shirt over his eyes. napping is a behavior associated with sleeping. the presence of a person beside him does not contradict the hypothesis as people often sleep near others. step 2: the hypothesis 'a sleeping man' is consistent with the premise 'a man napping with a shirt over his eyes'. the hypothesis can be seen as a more specific version of the premise. step 3: the hypothesis 'a sleeping man' can be logically inferred from the premise 'a man napping with a shirt over his eyes'. both the premise and hypothesis describe the same situation but with different focuses."
1953,A young girl who is barefoot and with a scarf over her head dips her pen in ink and writes in a notebook.,dog chases squirrel,0,0,True,"step 1. in the premise, a young girl is described as being barefoot and having a scarf over her head while she writes in a notebook with a pen dipped in ink. this scenario does not involve any animals or actions related to chasing or squirrels.step 2. the hypothesis suggests that a dog chases a squirrel, which is completely unrelated to the situation described in the premise. the actions and objects mentioned in the hypothesis (a dog chasing a squirrel) cannot be logically inferred from the premise.step 3. based on the given information, the hypothesis cannot be inferred from the premise as it presents an entirely different scenario."
1954,Ireland Under the Normans,The Normans ruled Ireland for 400 years.,1,1,True,"step 1: the premise 'ireland under the normans' refers to a historical period where the normans had control over ireland. this control could be political, cultural, or social. common sense and historical facts support the idea that the normans had significant influence in ireland for several centuries.step 2: the hypothesis 'the normans ruled ireland for 400 years' is a specific duration statement about the time frame of the normans' rule in ireland as described in the premise. the hypothesis is consistent with the information provided in the premise and does not contradict it.step 3: based on the logical relationship between the premise and the hypothesis, the hypothesis is a reasonable inference from the premise. the hypothesis provides additional detail about the duration of the normans' rule in ireland, which is a factual detail that can be inferred from the premise.therefore, the hypothesis can be logically inferred from the premise."
1955,these folks are so backwards it's just ridiculous it's pathetic,These people are the forerunners of modern society.,0,0,True,"step 1: in the premise, the speaker expresses a negative opinion about 'these folks', implying that they are outdated or unsophisticated. this opinion is subjective and based on a stereotype or prejudice. step 2. the hypothesis, on the other hand, contradicts the premise, suggesting that 'these people' were actually pioneers or leaders in modern society. the hypothesis cannot be logically inferred from the premise as there's no factual or logical connection between the two statements. step 3. based on the given information, the hypothesis is not entailed by the premise."
1956,"The University of Hawaiʻ i at Hilo or UH Hilo is a public co-educational university in Hilo, Hawaiʻ i, United States.","The University of Hawaiʻ i at Hilo or UH UMass Dartmouth is a public co-educational university in Hilo, Hawaiʻ i, United States.",1,0,False,"step 1: the premise describes uh hilo as a public co-educational university located in hilo, hawaiʻi, united states. no specific information is given about any other universities. the hypothesis also describes a public co-educational university located in hilo, hawaiʻi, united states, but it incorrectly mentions umass dartmouth instead of uh hilo.step 2: the hypothesis cannot be logically inferred from the premise. the premise talks about uh hilo, while the hypothesis incorrectly mentions umass dartmouth. the two are not the same institution, and the hypothesis does not follow from the premise.step 3: based on the logical analysis, the hypothesis is not entailed by the premise."
1957,"You can also stay overnight at Ein Gedi's modern kibbutz hotel, set in a botanical garden of exotic trees and plantings.",Ein Gedi's kibbutz hotel is in the middle of a shopping area.,0,0,True,"step 1. in the premise, ein gedi's kibbutz hotel is described as being located in a botanical garden of exotic trees and plantings, and it is also mentioned that you can stay overnight there. no information is provided about the proximity of a shopping area.step 2. the hypothesis asserts that the hotel is in the middle of a shopping area. this is not a logical consequence of the premise, as there is no information suggesting that a shopping area is located near or within the botanical garden where the hotel is situated.step 3. based on the given information, the hypothesis cannot be logically inferred from the premise."
1958,Competition was designed to improve quality.,Competition between companies was designed to raise quality.,1,1,True,"step 1: the premise states that competition was designed to improve quality. this means that the existence of competition in a given context is intended to lead to better quality outcomes.step 2: the hypothesis suggests that competition between companies was designed to raise quality. this is a specific instance of competition being used as a means to improve quality, which is consistent with the information in the premise.step 3: based on the logical consistency between the premise and hypothesis, common sense understanding of competition as a driver for improvement, and the lack of contradictory information, the hypothesis can be inferred from the premise."
1959,"The ability of the case study to capitalize on insight, to shift focus as the data demand, and to let disparate pieces of evidence fall into place in ways that are not always easy to describe or command is believed to yield a richer, fuller, and truer explanation of why things look the way they do than the more limited number of tests of a priori hypotheses that other methods use.",The case study focuses on the inability to change as data changes.,0,0,True,"step 1: in the premise, the case study is described as having the ability to adapt to new data and insights, shifting focus as needed, and allowing evidence to fall into place in ways that are not always easy to describe or command. this implies a flexibility and adaptability that is not typical of methods that solely test a priori hypotheses.step 2: the hypothesis, on the other hand, suggests a focus on the inability to change as data changes. this interpretation is not directly supported by the premise. in fact, the premise implies the opposite - the ability to adapt and change as new data arises.step 3: based on the information identified in step 1, the hypothesis cannot be logically inferred from the premise. the hypothesis contradicts the flexibility and adaptability described in the premise. therefore, the hypothesis is not entailed by the premise."
1960,He fled in his car when cops arrived and led them on a chase that ended in the massive crash.,He stayed put and calmly showed the officers his license and registration.,0,0,True,"step 1: in the premise, it is stated that the person fled in his car and led the police on a chase that ended in a crash. this implies a situation where the person is trying to evade the authorities. common sense and logical reasoning suggest that 'staying put and calmly showing the officers his license and registration' are actions that are inconsistent with trying to evade the police. step 2: the hypothesis 'he stayed put and calmly showed the officers his license and registration' is not logically entailed by the premise because the actions described in the hypothesis contradict the actions described in the premise. step 3: based on the logical inconsistency between the premise and hypothesis, the hypothesis cannot be inferred from the premise."
1961,The phrase alcohol problems includes all those problems as well as the hazardous drinking.,They did not want to see them drink so much.,1,0,False,"step 1: in the premise, 'alcohol problems' is defined to include 'all those problems' and 'hazardous drinking'. this implies that any issue related to alcohol consumption, including excessive drinking, falls under the category of 'alcohol problems'. step 2: the hypothesis, 'they did not want to see them drink so much', does not directly follow from the premise. however, the hypothesis implies a concern for excessive drinking, which is a type of alcohol problem as defined in the premise. step 3: while the hypothesis cannot be logically deduced from the premise alone, it is consistent with the information in the premise. common sense and contextual understanding suggest that a concern for excessive drinking falls under the broader category of 'alcohol problems'. step 4: based on logical consistency, common sense, and the given information, the hypothesis is not directly entailed by the premise but remains a valid and plausible inference."
1962,"-Rural routes have only 4.3 pieces per possible delivery, while city residential routes have",Residential routes have more pieces of mail per delivery.,1,0,False,"step 1. the premise states that rural routes have fewer pieces of mail per delivery compared to city residential routes. step 2. the hypothesis suggests that residential routes have more pieces of mail per delivery. the hypothesis contradicts the premise, as it states the opposite. step 3. based on the logical inconsistency between the premise and hypothesis, the hypothesis cannot be logically inferred from the premise."
1963,yeah it begins to make you wonder why we didn't go ahead and go on in and,it makes you wonder why we didn't act more cautiously and stay back,0,1,False,"step 1: both the premise and hypothesis express the idea of wondering or questioning the decision to proceed or act. the premise suggests that the speaker is questioning the decision to 'go on in' without further caution, while the hypothesis suggests that the speaker is questioning the decision to 'act more cautiously' and 'stay back'. these phrases convey similar meanings, with the difference being in the specific actions suggested to have been taken.step 2: the hypothesis can be considered a more general or abstract version of the premise. the premise is a specific instance of wondering, while the hypothesis is a more general expression of the same thought. the hypothesis can be inferred from the premise as it is a logical consequence of the premise's meaning.step 3: based on the logical relationship between the premise and hypothesis, the hypothesis can be inferred from the premise."
1964,It was used for a spell in the 18th century as a post office.,It has always been a church.,0,0,True,"step 1: in the premise, it is stated that the building was used for a spell (an extended period of time) as a post office in the 18th century. this information implies that the building had a different function at that time but does not necessarily mean it has always had that function or only that function. step 2: the hypothesis states that 'it has always been a church.' this claim contradicts the information in the premise, as the premise specifies that the building had a different function (post office) at some point in its history. step 3: based on the logical reasoning, it is clear that the hypothesis cannot be inferred from the premise as the premise explicitly states that the building had a different function in the past."
1966,oh sure i think that's that's i feel that you know for certain cases that i that i am willing to give up my rights to secure the rights of others i guess is what i'm saying,There are lots of people who need help with practicing their rights.,1,1,True,"step 1: in the premise, the speaker is expressing a willingness to give up their own rights to secure the rights of others. this implies a belief that there are situations where others' rights need protection.step 2: the hypothesis states that 'there are lots of people who need help with practicing their rights.' this statement is consistent with the premise as it suggests that there are indeed people in need of help in securing their rights.step 3: based on the information provided, the hypothesis can be inferred from the premise as it is a reasonable implication of the speaker's statement.step 4: the premise does not directly state or imply a specific number of people in need of help, but the hypothesis provides a quantification ('lots') which is a reasonable assumption given the context of the premise.therefore, the hypothesis can be logically inferred from the premise."
1967,An elderly woman in a crowd pushing a wheelchair.,There is a young man in a crowd.,0,0,True,"step 1: in the premise, an elderly woman is identified, and she is pushing a wheelchair in a crowd. this scene does not provide any direct information about other people in the crowd or their ages.step 2: the hypothesis introduces a young man in the crowd. this new information does not contradict the premise, but it is not logically entailed from it either. the presence of the elderly woman and the wheelchair does not imply the presence or absence of a young man.step 3: based on the information given, the hypothesis cannot be logically inferred from the premise. there is no entailment relationship between them."
1968,"What had he expected, anyway?",What were his expectations of his family?,1,1,True,"step 1: in the premise, 'he' is referred to but no specific information about his expectations is mentioned. the question 'what had he expected, anyway?' implies a general inquiry about his expectations. in the hypothesis, 'his expectations of his family' is a more specific version of 'what he had expected'. they both relate to expectations. step 2: the hypothesis can be inferred from the premise as it is a more specific version of the expectations mentioned in the premise. step 3: based on the logical relationship between the two statements, the hypothesis can be inferred from the premise."
1969,Bob Dylan is in the hospital with a chest infection.,Bob Dylan has never gotten sick before in his life.,0,0,True,"step 1: in the premise, it is stated that bob dylan is currently in the hospital due to a chest infection. this information does not provide any details about his past health conditions or history. the hypothesis, on the other hand, asserts that bob dylan has never gotten sick before in his life. step 2: this hypothesis directly contradicts the information given in the premise, as bob dylan's current illness explicitly disproves the hypothesis. step 3: based on the logical analysis, it is clear that the hypothesis cannot be inferred from the premise, as the premise does not support the hypothesis and in fact contradicts it."
1970,"They say that the police mishandled the crime scene , allowing John Ramsey to search the house, and point out that the police let the couple leave town for several weeks prior to questioning them.",The crime scene was mishandled and the Ramsey's left town before they could be questioned but the DA's office played a big part in it.,1,0,False,"step 1: in the premise, it is stated that the police mishandled the crime scene, which allowed john ramsey to search the house. this implies that the police actions may have impeded the investigation. however, the premise does not specify who was responsible for the ramsey's leaving town or why they were allowed to do so.step 2: the hypothesis suggests that the da's office played a big part in allowing the ramsey's to leave town before being questioned. this could potentially be inferred from the premise if we assume that the police were acting under the authority or direction of the da's office. however, without explicit evidence in the premise that the da's office gave the order for the ramsey's departure or mishandled the crime scene, the hypothesis is not logically entailed by the premise.step 3: it is possible that other factors, such as jurisdictional boundaries or procedural oversights, may have contributed to the timing of the questioning and the handling of the crime scene. without further information, it is not possible to definitively determine the role of the da's office in these events.step 4: it is important to note that this analysis is based on the given information alone. common sense reasoning would suggest that investigative procedures and jurisdictional responsibilities are typically delineated between different law enforcement agencies and offices. thus, it is unlikely, but not impossible, that the da's office directly ordered or facilitated the mishandling of the crime scene and the ramsey's departure.therefore, based on the given information, the hypothesis 'the crime scene was mishandled and the ramsey's left town before they could be questioned but the da's office played a big part in it' is not logically entailed by the premise, but it is a plausible hypothesis under certain assumptions."
1971,"The Army discharged a 20-year decorated veteran one week before he would have been eligible for retirement benefits, because investigators discovered evidence of his homosexuality after an arsonist torched his home.",The veteran's home was set on fire by accident.,0,0,True,"step 1: in the premise, there is information about the army discharging a decorated veteran before his retirement due to discovered evidence of his homosexuality, and that this occurred after his home was torched. the information does not suggest any connection between the discharge and the arson. the hypothesis is about a completely different event - an accidental fire.step 2: the hypothesis 'the veteran's home was set on fire by accident' is not logically derived from the premise 'the army discharged a 20-year decorated veteran one week before he would have been eligible for retirement benefits, because investigators discovered evidence of his homosexuality after an arsonist torched his home'. the hypothesis does not follow from the premise because the premise neither implies nor contradicts the hypothesis.step 3: based on the logical analysis, there is no entailment between the premise and hypothesis."
1972,"These revelations were embarrassing to Clinton's opponents, wrote the Washington Post . The Sun-Times quoted Rahm Emanuel, Stephanopoulos' successor, on the  From Day One I always thought this was politically motivated and had politics written all over it; after five years, it is nice to have the truth catch up with the president's political opponents.",Clinton's supporters were humiliated by the news about Benghazi. ,1,1,True,"step 1: in the premise, the washington post and the sun-times report that revelations were embarrassing to clinton's opponents. the sun-times also quotes rahm emanuel, a clinton supporter, stating that he believed the issue was politically motivated. the context suggests that the 'revelations' likely refer to an event or situation that negatively impacted clinton's political standing. step 2: the hypothesis proposes that clinton's supporters were humiliated by the news about benghazi. this can be logically inferred from the premise because clinton's opponents being embarrassed implies that something had negatively affected them, and benghazi was a well-known controversy surrounding clinton's tenure as secretary of state. the hypothesis is consistent with the information in the premise and does not contradict it. step 3: based on the logical connection between the premise and hypothesis, and the lack of contradictory information, the hypothesis is a reasonable entailment of the premise."
1973,"But, on the whole, public opinion swings to the side of the Government.",There are many who would side with the government.,1,1,True,"step 1: in the premise, it is stated that public opinion swings to the side of the government. this suggests that a majority or a significant number of people support or agree with the government's actions or policies. step 2: the hypothesis 'there are many who would side with the government' logically follows the premise. if public opinion swings to the side of the government, it implies that there is a considerable number of individuals who hold this view. therefore, it is a reasonable inference that 'many' people would indeed side with the government. step 3: based on the logical connection between the premise and hypothesis, and the absence of contradictory information, the hypothesis is entailed by the premise."
1974,a skateboarder is performing stunt on a graffiti covered skateboard ramp.,A skateboarder is texting his friends.,0,0,True,"step 1: in the premise, a skateboarder is performing a stunt on a graffiti covered skateboard ramp. this implies that the skateboarder is engaged in an activity related to skateboarding. step 2: the hypothesis suggests that the skateboarder is texting his friends. texting is an entirely different activity from skateboarding. step 3: the hypothesis cannot be logically inferred from the premise because performing a skateboard stunt and texting are two distinct actions. the fact that one activity is happening does not provide any evidence or logical connection to the other."
1975,A black race car starts up in front of a crowd of people.,A man is driving down a lonely road.,0,0,True,"step 1: in the premise, a black race car starts up in front of a crowd of people. this implies the presence of a race car and a crowd. no information is given about the location or the identity of the driver or the presence of a road.step 2: the hypothesis describes a scenario where a man is driving down a lonely road. this is not directly related to or logically deducible from the premise as there is no mention of a road, a man, or a lonely condition in the premise.step 3: based on the given information, the hypothesis 'a man is driving down a lonely road' cannot be logically inferred from the premise 'a black race car starts up in front of a crowd of people'.label: 0"
1976,"State justice communities begin to examine how they set priorities given changing demographics (census), new technology, emerging legal needs, commonalties among diverse communities, and severely marginalized client populations living within in our service areas.",State justice ignores the changing demographics and new technology.,0,0,True,"step 1: in the premise, it is mentioned that state justice communities are examining priorities considering changing demographics, new technology, emerging legal needs, commonalties among diverse communities, and severely marginalized client populations. this implies an active process of adapting to new circumstances.step 2: the hypothesis 'state justice ignores the changing demographics and new technology' contradicts the premise as it suggests a lack of action or consideration of these factors. therefore, the hypothesis cannot be logically inferred from the premise.step 3: based on the information provided, the hypothesis is not entailed by the premise as it implies a different scenario where state justice is not responding to changing demographics and new technology."
1977,oh yeah yeah no no and it's funny you know You like to pull for the underdog and for a long time i was pulling for Denver,You always like to pull for the team that is definitely going to win.,0,0,True,"step 1: in the premise, the speaker mentions their past behavior of rooting for the underdog team, denver. this implies a pattern of supporting teams that are not expected to win. no contradictory facts are presented.step 2: the hypothesis states that the speaker always likes to root for the winning team. while this is a possible behavior, it is in direct contradiction to the speaker's stated behavior in the premise.step 3: based on the logical analysis, the hypothesis cannot be inferred from the premise as it contradicts the information provided in the premise.step 4: the speaker's stated behavior in the premise does not exclude the possibility of also rooting for the winning team at times, but the hypothesis goes beyond this and makes a universal claim about the speaker's behavior.therefore, the hypothesis is not entailed by the premise."
1978,The cover stories are pegged to Colin Powell's volunteer summit.,Colin Powell's volunteer meetings were the main focus of the Time's cover story.,1,1,True,"step 1: in the premise, 'cover stories' are mentioned, which refers to the main articles or themes featured on the cover of a magazine. 'pegged to' implies that these stories are related to an event or topic. in this case, the event is colin powell's volunteer summit. step 2: the hypothesis suggests that colin powell's volunteer meetings were the central theme of time's cover story. this inference is reasonable, as 'focus' implies that the volunteer meetings were the primary subject of the cover story. step 3: based on the information provided, the hypothesis can be inferred from the premise, as the premise indicates that the cover stories are related to colin powell's volunteer summit, and the hypothesis suggests that the volunteer meetings were the main focus of those stories."
1980,The Wave is one of Bose's better devices.,The wave is terrible. ,0,0,True,"step 1: the premise indicates that the wave is one of bose's better devices. this statement implies that the wave performs well or has desirable features, as it is being compared favorably to other devices from the same manufacturer.step 2: the hypothesis states that the wave is terrible, which is directly contradictory to the premise. the premise describes the wave as better, while the hypothesis describes it as terrible.step 3: based on the logical negation of the premise, the hypothesis cannot be inferred from the premise. the hypothesis contradicts the premise, making it an incorrect conclusion."
1981,The Scotland Yard men were the cynosure of all eyes. ,The Scotland Yard men were quite popular due to their attractiveness.,1,1,True,"step 1: 'the scotland yard men were the cynosure of all eyes' means they were the center of attention or focus of everyone present. this could be due to various reasons, including their attractiveness. step 2: the hypothesis 'the scotland yard men were quite popular due to their attractiveness' logically follows 'the scotland yard men were the cynosure of all eyes', as 'being the center of attention' is a reasonable implication of being popular and attractive. step 3: based on the logical connection between being the center of attention and being popular due to attractiveness, the hypothesis can be inferred from the premise."
1982,"But, notes the Post , neither the Globe nor the National Enquirer is seeing much of a bump.",The National Enquirer is doing better than the Globe.,1,0,False,"step 1: in the premise, it is mentioned that neither the globe nor the national enquirer is seeing much of a bump. this implies that their sales or readership numbers have not significantly increased. step 2: the hypothesis suggests that the national enquirer is doing better than the globe, which contradicts the information given in the premise. step 3: based on the logical negation of the hypothesis being inconsistent with the premise, the hypothesis cannot be logically inferred from the premise.step 4: it is important to note that while the hypothesis cannot be logically inferred from the premise, it does not necessarily mean that the hypothesis is false. there could be other factors or context not included in the premise that could affect their sales or readership numbers, leading to the possibility of the national enquirer doing better than the globe. however, based solely on the given information, the hypothesis is not entailed by the premise."
1983,and the one thing that i did notice is that people that have the underground irrigation systems the sprinkler systems just that was the way to go if you could do it people that were building the new homes that put those in,I noticed that people regretted putting in underground irrigation systems.,0,0,True,"step 1: the premise describes a situation where people who have underground irrigation systems consider it a good investment during home construction. it does not provide any information about regrets or dissatisfaction with this investment.step 2: the hypothesis states that people regretted putting in underground irrigation systems, which contradicts the information presented in the premise. it's important to note that the absence of information in the premise does not automatically mean that the hypothesis is wrong; however, it creates a contradiction that needs to be addressed.step 3: to determine if the hypothesis can be logically inferred from the premise, it's essential to consider common-sense reasoning and potential explanations for why people might regret this investment. underground irrigation systems can be expensive to install and maintain, and there might be unforeseen issues like leaks or damage that could lead to regrets. however, the premise does not provide any information about the costs, maintenance issues, or potential problems with underground irrigation systems.step 4: without sufficient information to logically infer the hypothesis from the premise, we cannot assume entailment. it's possible that people might have regretted their decision for reasons not mentioned in the premise, but it's also possible that the hypothesis is incorrect based on the information given.step 5: based on the given information, the hypothesis cannot be logically inferred from the premise."
1984,"Launching the State Planning Initiative, LSC staff developed and issued Program Letters 1998-117 and 199818 which directed programs to plan for the creation of comprehensive, integrated, client-centered legal services systems and defined the terms of such systems.",LSC staff did not issue Program Letter 1998-117.,0,0,True,"step 1: in the premise, it is stated that lsc staff developed and issued two specific program letters (1998-117 and 1998-18) as part of the state planning initiative. the content of these letters is also described. step 2: the hypothesis proposes the direct opposite of the information given in the premise, stating that lsc staff did not issue program letter 1998-117. this contradicts the premise. step 3: based on the logical contradiction between the premise and hypothesis, the hypothesis cannot be inferred from the premise."
1985,"Serious questions were being raised about whether the policies he was proposing for taxes, expenditures, and the deficit added up.",We were on the fence about whether or not the policies added up.,1,1,True,"step 1: in the premise, it is stated that serious questions were being raised about the policies for taxes, expenditures, and the deficit. this implies uncertainty about the mathematical coherence and feasibility of the policies. step 2: the hypothesis, 'we were on the fence about whether or not the policies added up,' directly conveys the same uncertainty. the hypothesis is a clear implication and a rephrased version of the premise. step 3: based on the logical relationship between the premise and hypothesis, the hypothesis is entailed by the premise."
1986,"In these cases, participants risk losing not only their jobs but also a significant portion of their retirement savings if their company files for bankruptcy.",Participants who have worked at the company for less than 4 years are at a higher risk of losing their job during bankruptcy.,1,1,True,"step 1: in the premise, it is stated that participants in certain cases face the risk of losing their jobs and a significant portion of their retirement savings if their company files for bankruptcy. this indicates a situation where bankruptcy results in job loss and financial loss for employees. step 2: the hypothesis suggests that participants who have worked at the company for less than 4 years are at a higher risk of losing their jobs. this can be logically inferred from the premise based on the following reasoning: a) the premise states that participants risk losing their jobs during bankruptcy. b) the hypothesis identifies a specific subset of participants (those who have worked for less than 4 years) as being at a higher risk. c) it is a common occurrence for companies to let go of newer employees during times of financial distress, as they may be considered less essential or have less seniority. d) the premise does not contradict this hypothesis, as it does not state that job security is proportional to tenure regardless of bankruptcy. step 3: based on the logical reasoning and common sense understanding of employment situations during bankruptcy, the hypothesis can be inferred from the premise."
1987,"The full extent of unpaid wage damages, failure to pay end-of-season bonuses, wrongful discharge, retaliation, and disputes over periods of employment often may not be determined until the work is finished.",People are missing $2 million in lost wages.,1,0,False,step 1: the premise discusses various unpaid damages and disputes that may not be determined until the work is finished. it does not specify any particular amount of money related to these damages or disputes. step 2: the hypothesis states that 'people are missing $2 million in lost wages.' this implies that there is a total sum of $2 million that has not been paid to certain individuals. step 3: the hypothesis cannot be logically inferred from the premise since the premise does not provide any information about the total amount of unpaid damages or disputes. the hypothesis introduces a new fact that goes beyond the information given in the premise.
1988,"He was the father of Chris Evert, who was one of the world's top women tennis players in the 1970s and 1980s.","He was the father of Chris Evert, who was one of the world's top women tennis players in the 19701 and 1980s.",0,1,False,"step 1: the premise establishes that the subject is the father of chris evert, who is identified as a top women tennis player in the 1970s and 1980s. no new information is introduced in the hypothesis. step 2: the hypothesis is an exact reproduction of the premise; it does not add, subtract, or contradict any information. as a result, the hypothesis can be logically inferred from the premise. step 3: given the identical nature of the premise and hypothesis, the hypothesis is entailed by the premise."
1990,Two people look at two red motorcycles in a place where there are religious murals on the wall.,The two people are looking at motorcycles.,1,1,True,"step 1: in the premise, we have the information that two people are looking at two red motorcycles. this implies that the people are focusing their attention on the motorcycles. step 2: the hypothesis also states that the two people are looking at motorcycles. this is a direct match with the information provided in the premise. step 3: given that the hypothesis is an exact restatement of the premise, it can be logically inferred from the premise. in fact, the hypothesis is equivalent to the premise. therefore, the hypothesis is entailed by the premise. "
1991,uh browned on all all sides and then drain off all the grease uh then what i usually do is i freeze them and then when you're ready to serve them,There will be no excess grease once browned.,0,0,True,"step 1. in the premise, the speaker mentions browning food on all sides and then draining off all the grease. this implies that the food is being cooked in a significant amount of grease. step 2. the hypothesis states that there will be no excess grease once browned. while it's possible for this to be the case, it's not a logical conclusion that can be directly inferred from the premise. the speaker in the premise states that they drain off the grease, which contradicts the hypothesis. step 3. based on the given information, the hypothesis is not a logical entailment of the premise."
1992,"And the old Dublin is with us, too the irreverent city of wit and charm and that peculiar magic possessed by Ireland and the Irish.",Dublin has a lot of historic sites to visit.,1,1,True,"step 1: the premise describes dublin as an 'irreverent city' with 'wit and charm' and 'a peculiar magic.' these descriptors do not directly relate to historic sites. however, the premise also mentions that dublin is 'too' with us, suggesting that it remains a present and vital part of ireland. step 2: the hypothesis states that dublin 'has a lot of historic sites to visit.' this is a logical inference from the premise given that dublin being an 'irreverent city' or possessing 'peculiar magic' does not contradict or negate the presence of historic sites. dublin's historic sites contribute to its unique character and charm, making it a place worth visiting for both its history and its irreverent nature. step 3: based on the logical reasoning and the fact that the premise does not exclude the presence of historic sites, the hypothesis is a valid inference from the premise."
1993,"Developing and adjusting organizationwide policies and guidance, thus reducing redundant policy-related activities across the organization's units.",The employees had expressed frustration with the redundant policies.,1,1,True,"step 1: in the premise, we have a situation where someone (presumably, a leader or decision-maker) is addressing redundant policy-related activities within an organization. this implies that there have been unnecessary or duplicate policies that have caused inefficiencies or confusion among employees. step 2: the hypothesis suggests that the employees have expressed frustration with these redundant policies. this is a logical inference because frustration is a natural response to inefficiencies, duplicate efforts, or unclear guidelines. in this context, the hypothesis is a reasonable explanation for why there was a need to develop and adjust organization-wide policies. step 3: based on the logical connection between the premise and hypothesis, and the common sense understanding that employees would be frustrated with redundant policies, the hypothesis can be inferred from the premise."
1994,"Other information came from surveys of nonfederal hospitals about the sources, coverage limits, and costs and claims from leading insurers in each state and, for comparison, the same type of information from a nationwide company.",Only data from federal farm contracts was included in the survey.,0,0,True,"step 1: in the premise, it is mentioned that information was gathered from surveys of nonfederal hospitals about sources, coverage limits, and costs and claims from leading insurers in each state and compared with the same type of information from a nationwide company. this implies that the survey covered multiple insurers, both state-level and a nationwide one.step 2: the hypothesis suggests that only data from federal farm contracts was included in the survey. however, this statement is not logically inferred from the premise. the premise does not mention anything about federal farm contracts being included or excluded from the survey.step 3: based on the information provided in the premise, the hypothesis cannot be logically inferred. the premise does not entail the hypothesis, and the hypothesis contradicts the information given in the premise about multiple insurers being surveyed."
1996,as little as possible  i'm a college student,I graduated from college last year.,0,0,True,"step 1: in the premise, 'as little as possible' is a phrase that modifies 'i'm a college student.' it indicates that the speaker is currently enrolled in college and minimizes their involvement or commitment in other areas. the hypothesis, 'i graduated from college last year,' presents a distinct situation where the speaker is no longer a student.step 2: the hypothesis contradicts the premise because the speaker in the premise is currently a student and graduating from college is an event that marks the end of the student status. therefore, the hypothesis cannot be logically inferred from the premise.step 3: based on the logical analysis and the clear contradiction between the premise and hypothesis, the hypothesis is not entailed by the premise."
1997,A piece warns that Russia's nuclear power plants are shabby and decaying.,A piece that completely avoids Russia's nuclear power plant issues. ,0,0,True,"step 1: in the premise, there is an assertion about the condition of russia's nuclear power plants being shabby and decaying. this implies that there are concerns or issues regarding the safety and maintenance of these power plants.step 2: the hypothesis states that there is a piece of writing that completely avoids these issues. this means that the hypothesis suggests the absence of any discussion or focus on russia's nuclear power plant problems in the given piece of writing.step 3: there is no logical entailment between the premise and hypothesis. the premise talks about the state of russia's nuclear power plants, while the hypothesis describes the content of a specific piece of writing. the hypothesis does not follow logically from the premise, as one does not necessarily imply the other.step 4: in the context of natural language processing and reasoning, it is important to distinguish between the content of a text and the implications or conclusions that can be drawn from that content. the hypothesis does not logically follow from the premise, and there is no entailment relationship between them."
1998,Four men in black leather armor and bronze masks stopped in front of him.,Four men in white leather armor stopped in front of him.,0,0,True,"step 1. in the premise, four men are described as wearing black leather armor and bronze masks. this information is specific to the appearance of these men. the hypothesis states that four men in white leather armor stopped in front of him. step 2. the hypothesis contradicts the premise as it changes a key element of the description - the color of their leather armor from black to white. step 3. based on the given information, the hypothesis cannot be logically inferred from the premise as it introduces a contradictory detail."
1999,The site was rediscovered by a British archaeologist in 1869 after six years of searching.,The site was rediscovered by an Italian archaeologist in 1888.,0,0,True,"step 1: in the premise, we have a clear statement that the site was rediscovered by a british archaeologist in 1869 after six years of searching. this information provides a definitive answer about who discovered the site and when. step 2: the hypothesis suggests that the site was rediscovered by an italian archaeologist in 1888, which is a different person and a different year compared to the premise. step 3: based on the available information, the hypothesis cannot be logically inferred from the premise, as it contradicts the stated facts. therefore, the hypothesis is not entailed by the premise.step 4 (optional): to further validate the conclusion, we could consider checking historical records or expert opinions to ensure the accuracy of the premise and the impossibility of the hypothesis given context and facts."
2000,"I told 'em, no thanks.","I used a calm voice and said ""No, thank you.""",1,0,False,"step 1: the premise 'i told 'em, no thanks' is a colloquial way of expressing that the speaker declined an offer or request. it doesn't provide specific information about the tone or manner in which the speaker refused. step 2: the hypothesis 'i used a calm voice and said "
2001,"The Praya, the promenade in front of the ferry pier, is a good place to observe the many junks and fishing boats in the harbor.",The fishing boats make a big commotion in the harbor that can be heard from the Praya.,1,1,True,"step 1: in the premise, the praya is described as a place to observe the junks and fishing boats in the harbor. this implies that the praya has a clear view of the harbor and its activities. step 2: the hypothesis suggests that the fishing boats make a big commotion that can be heard from the praya. this is a reasonable inference, as the close proximity and clear view of the harbor from the praya would allow the observer to hear the sounds of the fishing boats. step 3: based on the logical connection between the premise and hypothesis, and the common-sense understanding that sounds travel through the air, the hypothesis can be inferred from the premise.step 4: it is also important to note that there is no contradictory information in the premise or hypothesis that would prevent the hypothesis from being inferred.therefore,"
2002,"He uses it even more than bona fide Christian-right pols do, as Fred Barnes points out, in order to allay suspicions that he may be moderate or indifferent on social issues.",He uses it less than the religious right does.,0,0,True,"step 1: in the premise, it is stated that the person in question uses a term 'even more than bona fide christian-right pols do' to address any suspicions of moderation or indifference on social issues. this implies that the person's usage of the term is relatively higher compared to that of the christian right. step 2: the hypothesis suggests that the person uses the term 'less than the religious right does.' this directly contradicts the information stated in the premise, as the person's usage is described as 'even more' and not 'less' than the religious right. step 3: based on the logical contradiction between the premise and hypothesis, it can be concluded that the hypothesis is not entailed by the premise."
2003,"Jews have been a permanent feature of Roman life for over 2,500 years but were forced into a ghetto in the 16th century.","There weren't any Jews in Roma, were there?",0,0,True,"step 1: the premise states that jews have been a permanent feature of roman life for over 2,500 years, but they were later forced into a ghetto in the 16th century. this implies that jews lived in rome for a very long time before the establishment of ghettos. there is no indication in the premise that jews were ever completely absent from roma. step 2: the hypothesis suggests that there weren't any jews in roma, which contradicts the premise since it states that jews have been a permanent feature of roman life. step 3: based on the logical negation of the premise, the hypothesis is not entailed and cannot be inferred from the premise."
2004,"I'm about as big a media hound as anyone, McCain told one newspaper, but I've turned down at least 500--maybe 600 or 700--requests to go on talk shows on this issue.",McCain never turns down an interview.,0,0,True,"step 1: in the premise, mccain mentions that he has turned down a significant number of interview requests. the number is estimated to be between 500 to 700 requests. step 2: the hypothesis states that mccain never turns down an interview. this is a clear contradiction to the premise. if mccain never turns down an interview, then the number of requests he's turned down would be zero. step 3: based on the direct contradiction between the premise and hypothesis, the hypothesis is not entailed by the premise."
2005,The stadium has been home to Premier League club Everton since its completion in 1892 and is one of the world's oldest purpose-built football grounds.,The stadium has been home to Premier League club Everton since its completion in 1893 and is one of the world's oldest purpose-built football grounds.,0,1,False,"step 1: the premise establishes that everton has been playing at the stadium since its completion in 1892, making it one of the oldest purpose-built football grounds. no specific information in the premise indicates the exact year of completion to be 1893. the hypothesis does not contradict the premise as it only changes the year of completion.step 2: the hypothesis can be logically inferred from the premise with the minimal change of a single year in the factual information provided. the difference between 1892 and 1893 is insignificant in the context of the premise, and the hypothesis does not introduce any contradictory or unreasonable elements.step 3: based on the logical reasoning, the hypothesis can be inferred from the premise as it is a consequence of the premise with a slight modification."
2006,The two men watched Adrin as he approached.,Adrin walked quickly to the men.,1,0,False,"step 1: in the premise, we have three subjects: 'two men', 'adrin', and 'he' (referring to adrin). the action 'watched' implies that the men were observing adrin as he approached them. there's no information about adrin's speed in the premise. step 2: the hypothesis suggests that adrin walked quickly towards the men. this doesn't directly contradict the premise but doesn't necessarily follow from it either. it's possible for adrin to walk quickly as he approaches, but it's also possible for him to walk at a normal pace. step 3: based on the given information, we cannot logically infer that adrin walked quickly from the premise alone. the premise does not entail the hypothesis."
2007,A group of Indian young women and girls are bathing at the edge of a pool with their dry clothes and a building in the background.,A group of men playfully splash water at each other.,0,0,True,"step 1: in the premise, there is no explicit information about the people playing water sports or any mention of men. the focus is on indian young women and girls bathing. however, there is a building in the background, which could imply a public or communal setting. step 2: the hypothesis describes a scene of men playing and splashing water at each other. this is an unrelated scenario that does not follow directly from the premise. there is no logical connection between the premise and hypothesis. step 3: based on the given information, there is no entailment between the premise and hypothesis. the hypothesis is not logically inferable from the premise."
2008,He was never interested in politics and has got a great rapport of being pious and honest administrator and human being.,He was sometimes interested in politics and has got a great rapport of being pious and honest administrator and human being.,0,0,True,"step 1: in the premise, it is stated that 'he was never interested in politics'. this implies that his focus and involvement have always been outside of politics. the hypothesis, on the other hand, suggests that 'he was sometimes interested in politics'. this introduces a potential contradiction with the premise's information. however, no explicit contradiction is present, as the hypothesis does not state that he is currently or consistently interested in politics. step 2: the hypothesis maintains the consistent statement that 'he has got a great rapport of being pious and honest administrator and human being'. this statement is not contradicted by the premise or the hypothesis. step 3: given the premise's statement about his lack of interest in politics and the hypothesis's statement that he was sometimes interested in politics, it is not a logical necessity that the hypothesis follows from the premise. however, the premise's statement does not contradict the hypothesis, either. since no contradiction is present and the hypothesis does not require the assumption that the subject's current interest in politics is ongoing, the hypothesis cannot be logically inferred from the premise. step 4: in conclusion, the hypothesis is not entailed by the premise as it introduces a potential, but not explicit, contradiction and does not logically follow from it."
2009,Religions of India,Some religions are more prominent than others.,1,1,True,"step 1: in the premise, 'religions of india' is a non-specific term that encompasses various religious traditions practiced in india. it does not provide any information about the prominence or popularity of any particular religion. step 2: the hypothesis, 'some religions are more prominent than others', is a general statement about the existence of differences in the popularity or influence of various religious traditions. step 3: the hypothesis can be inferred from the premise because the premise does not dispute the existence of differences in the prominence of various religions within the scope of 'religions of india'. the premise is descriptive and neutral, allowing for the possibility of variations in the prominence of different religious traditions. step 4: in the absence of any specific information to the contrary, the hypothesis is a reasonable inference from the premise."
2010,um what kind of hobbies do you have,What hobbies does your mother have?,0,0,True,"step 1: in the premise, the speaker is asking about the interlocutor's hobbies. hobbies are personal interests or activities. there is no specific information given about who the speaker is or any relationship between the speaker and the interlocutor. the hypothesis, on the other hand, asks about the hobbies of a specific person, the mother. step 2: the premise does not provide any information that can logically lead to the hypothesis that the mother has certain hobbies. the hypothesis is not entailed by the premise as there is no connection between the interlocutor's hobbies and their mother's hobbies. step 3: based on the given information, the hypothesis cannot be inferred from the premise."
2011,"Therefore, GAO's preliminary conclusions or recommendations are not discussed at the closeout meeting.",GAO's conclusions are talked about at the final meeting.,0,0,True,"step 1. the premise indicates that gao's preliminary conclusions or recommendations are not discussed at the closeout meeting. it is important to note that the premise only addresses the discussion of gao's preliminary conclusions or recommendations. we cannot infer anything about the final conclusions or recommendations from the premise.step 2. the hypothesis states that gao's conclusions are talked about at the final meeting. this statement is in direct contradiction to the premise as we cannot infer from the premise that gao's final conclusions are discussed at the closeout meeting.step 3. based on the information provided, the hypothesis is not entailed by the premise. the premise and hypothesis present conflicting information."
2012,"130 ""No,"" admitted Boris at last sullenly, ""you do not.""",Boris had resigned himself to defeat.,1,1,True,"step 1: the premise is a dialogue between two individuals, boris and an interlocutor, regarding boris' admission of not having something. the admission signifies boris' acceptance of a reality or situation. step 2: the hypothesis suggests boris has accepted or given in to a situation or outcome, thus it aligns with the meaning of the premise. step 3: based on the information and logical connection between the premise and hypothesis, the hypothesis is logically entailed by the premise."
2013,"Really good ones are now increasingly rare and quite expensive, and their length, 2 m (over 6 ft), makes them difficult to carry around.",The really good ones are becoming scarce because of their size and weight.,0,1,False,"step 1: in the premise, 'really good ones' are described as increasingly rare and quite expensive with a length of 2 m (over 6 ft), which makes them difficult to carry around. this implies that the scarcity and high cost of 'really good ones' is likely due to their size and weight. common sense and logical reasoning suggest that larger and heavier items are typically more difficult and costly to produce, transport, and store than smaller and lighter items. step 2: the hypothesis 'the really good ones are becoming scarce because of their size and weight' is a logical consequence of the information provided in the premise. it directly relates to the explanation for the scarcity and high cost of 'really good ones' given in the premise. step 3: based on the logical reasoning, common sense, and consistency with the information provided in the premise, the hypothesis can be inferred from the premise."
2014,"He and Bridger sold their fort in 1858, but Vasquez already had retired to Missouri.","He and Bridger sold their fort in 1859, but Vasquez already had retired to Missouri.",0,0,True,"step 1: in the premise, 'he and bridger sold their fort in 1858' describes an event where he and bridger sold their fort in a specific year. the hypothesis makes a similar statement but with the year changed to 1859. both sentences talk about he and bridger selling their fort, and the only difference is the year mentioned. however, the difference in year does not affect the logical relationship between the sentences. step 2: the hypothesis is not logically inferred from the premise because the premise and hypothesis describe different events due to the year difference. selling a fort in one year and selling it in another year are distinct events, even if all other conditions are identical. step 3: based on the logical analysis, the hypothesis is not entailed by the premise as they describe different events."
2015,"Now procurements of up to $25,000 can be approved by a single individual.","Procurements over $25,000 are approved by the head of accounting.",1,0,False,"step 1: the premise establishes that procurements up to $25,000 can be approved by a single individual. this implies that there is an individual with the authority to approve smaller procurements. step 2: the hypothesis states that procurements over $25,000 are approved by the head of accounting. this is a contradiction to the premise since it indicates a different individual has the authority to approve larger procurements. step 3: based on the logical contradiction between the premise and hypothesis, the hypothesis cannot be inferred from the premise.step 4: it is important to note that while the hypothesis contradicts the premise, it does not necessarily mean that the hypothesis is false. it only indicates that the hypothesis cannot be logically inferred from the premise."
2016,"The cliff road ends at the Victorian-era Old Lighthouse, which still protects ships passing this rocky promontory.",The Old Lighthouse was built for the royalty to live in.,1,0,False,"step 1: in the premise, the old lighthouse is described as a victorian-era structure that serves the purpose of protecting ships passing by. no information is provided regarding its occupants or the reason for its construction. step 2: the hypothesis suggests that the old lighthouse was built for the royalty to live in. there is no logical connection or evidence in the premise to support this claim. common sense and logical reasoning do not allow us to infer that a victorian-era lighthouse was built for royalty, as there is no historical or factual basis for this assumption. step 3: based on the information provided in the premise and the lack of logical or factual basis for the hypothesis, the hypothesis cannot be inferred from the premise."
2017,no that was another one yeah yeah uh well you know who i'm talking about,That was exactly him.,0,1,False,"step 1: in this example, both the premise and hypothesis are statements that identify a specific person. the hypothesis 'that was exactly him' is a confirmation or agreement with the identity mentioned in the premise 'who i'm talking about'. step 2: the hypothesis can be logically inferred from the premise if the referents of both are the same. in this case, since the speaker is indicating that 'he' mentioned in the hypothesis is the same person as in the premise, the hypothesis is a confirmation or restatement of the information in the premise. step 3: based on the logical consistency and the speaker's intent to confirm the identity, the hypothesis is entailed by the premise."
2018,"In addition, the specific key conditions and strategies described in this guide will provide insight when considering areas of future study.",This guide was compiled by a group of highly qualified scientists.,1,0,False,"step 1: the premise suggests that the guide, with its key conditions and strategies, can be valuable for future study. it does not provide any specific information about who compiled the guide. step 2: the hypothesis suggests that the guide was compiled by a group of highly qualified scientists. this information is not explicitly stated in the premise but could be a reasonable inference based on the assumption that qualified individuals would be best equipped to provide insight for future study. step 3: however, there is no definitive evidence in the premise that supports the hypothesis. the hypothesis goes beyond the information provided in the premise, as it introduces the qualification of the individuals who compiled the guide. step 4: without further context or evidence, it is not possible to logically infer that the hypothesis is entailed by the premise."
2019,Bridges link Macau with its two islands.,"Macau stays in touch with its islands, vital sources of agriculture and exotic resources.",1,1,True,"step 1: in the premise, 'bridges link macau with its two islands', we have macau being connected to its two islands. the presence of bridges indicates a means of transportation and communication between macau and the islands. step 2: the hypothesis, 'macau stays in touch with its islands, vital sources of agriculture and exotic resources', suggests that macau maintains contact and relies on the islands for essential resources. the hypothesis is consistent with the premise as the bridges facilitate the connection necessary for macau to stay in touch. step 3: based on the logical connection between the premise and hypothesis, and the common-sense understanding that bridges serve as essential links between separated entities, the hypothesis can be inferred from the premise."
2020,"177 Chapter 21 Tommy Makes a Discovery FOR a moment or two they stood staring at each other stupidly, dazed with the shock.",They immediately started talking at the same time. ,0,0,True,"step 1: in the premise, 'they' are described as standing staring at each other stupidly and dazed. this implies a moment of surprise or shock. however, the premise does not provide any direct evidence about what happens next or if they start talking at the same time. common sense and logical consistency suggest that the moment of shock and daze might lead to confusion and speaking at the same time, but this is not explicitly stated in the premise. step 2: while the hypothesis 'they immediately started talking at the same time' is not logically inferred from the premise, it is not necessarily contradictory either. the premise describes a moment of shock and daze, which could lead to speaking at the same time, but it does not definitively prove this. step 3: based on the given information, the hypothesis cannot be logically inferred from the premise, but it is not an outright contradiction either. it is possible that they both started talking at the same time after the moment described in the premise, but the premise does not provide enough evidence to definitively conclude this."
2021,The title Doctor of Biotechnical Sciences is acquired after only by defending the doctoral dissertation.,The title Doctor of Biotechnical Sciences is acquired after completing doctoral studies and defending doctoral dissertation or only by defending the doctoral dissertation.,1,1,True,"step 1: in the premise, it is stated that the title doctor of biotechnical sciences is acquired after defending the doctoral dissertation. this indicates that the defense of the dissertation is a necessary condition for obtaining the title. step 2: the hypothesis suggests that completing doctoral studies and defending the dissertation are both conditions for acquiring the title. since the premise already establishes the necessity of defending the dissertation, the hypothesis is entailed by the premise as it does not add any new contradictory information. step 3: based on the logical reasoning, the hypothesis can be inferred from the premise as it is a more comprehensive statement of the conditions required to acquire the title doctor of biotechnical sciences."
2022,"In considering how much of the anticipated budget surpluses to save, policy choices must balance today's unmet needs and tomorrow's fiscal challenges.",It isn't wise to spend all of a budget surplus unnecessarily.,1,1,True,"step 1: in the premise, the text indicates that policy choices involve deciding how much of a budget surplus to save, with a consideration of both current needs and future fiscal challenges. this implies that there is a need to balance the present and the future. step 2: the hypothesis suggests that not spending the entire budget surplus unnecessarily is a prudent decision. this advice aligns with the theme of balance and consideration for both current needs and future challenges in the premise. step 3: based on the logical connection between the premise and hypothesis, the hypothesis can be inferred from the premise as it represents a reasonable application of the principle of balancing current needs and future fiscal challenges."
2023,"Salem Hemp Fest, is a cannabis festival in Salem, Oregon, in the United States.","Salem Hempfest, or Salem Hemp Fest, is a cannabis festival in Salem, Oregon, in the United States.",1,1,True,"step 1: both the premise and hypothesis describe the same event, which is a cannabis festival named salem hemp fest taking place in salem, oregon, in the united states. no contradictory information is present in either statement.step 2: the hypothesis is identical in meaning to the premise. the slight differences in capitalization and spacing do not alter the logical relationship between the two statements.step 3: given the identical meanings, and the absence of any contradictory information, the hypothesis can be logically inferred from the premise."
2024,These omissions blur the characters and allow them to operate at the level of myth.,Omissions could cause the characters to develop at a slower pace.,1,0,False,"step 1: the premise suggests that omissions in a narrative can contribute to the development of characters at a level of myth, implying a symbolic or archetypal role. no contradictory facts are provided.step 2: the hypothesis proposes a causal relationship between omissions and slower character development. while it's not directly stated in the premise, it is a reasonable assumption that removing certain details or events from a narrative could influence the pacing. for instance, slowing down the narrative could allow for more focus on the characters and their development.step 3: based on logical reasoning and the assumption that omissions can affect the narrative pacing, the hypothesis can be inferred from the premise.step 4: however, it's important to note that the premise does not guarantee that omissions will result in slower character development. it only suggests that they contribute to a mythic or archetypal representation.therefore, the hypothesis is a possible interpretation, but it might not be a logical necessity."
2025,'Just because we agree on some minor particulars of philosophy does not make me his accomplice.',Agreeing on only one thing will make us great accomplices. ,0,0,True,"step 1: the premise asserts that agreeing on minor particulars of philosophy does not make someone an accomplice. this implies a distinction between agreement and complicity. it also suggests a context of philosophical discussions. step 2: the hypothesis proposes a situation where agreeing on only one thing makes individuals great accomplices. this proposition contradicts the premise, as it implies a direct connection between agreement and complicity that the premise denies. step 3: given that the hypothesis contradicts the premise, it cannot be logically inferred from the premise. the premise and hypothesis describe different scenarios with opposing implications."
2026,The bulk of GAO's work centered on the auditing of agency vouchers,GAO was not allowed to audit agencies.,0,0,True,"step 1: in the premise, it is stated that the 'bulk' of gao's work centered on the auditing of agency vouchers. this indicates that gao's primary role is auditing. there is no mention of any restrictions or limitations on their ability to audit in the given context.step 2: the hypothesis, 'gao was not allowed to audit agencies,' contradicts the premise. if gao were not allowed to audit, then the 'bulk' of their work could not have been auditing as stated in the premise.step 3: based on the logical analysis, the hypothesis is not entailed by the premise. the premise describes what gao does, while the hypothesis makes a claim about what they are not allowed to do."
2027,"By 1990, Hawaii was welcoming nearly 7 million visitors annually, seven times its own resident population, which is the most ethnically and racially diverse in the US.",Hawaii only had hundreds of visitors per year in 1990.,0,0,True,"step 1. in the premise, it is stated that hawaii welcomed nearly 7 million visitors annually by 1990, which is significantly more than its resident population. the diversity of hawaii's population is also mentioned. step 2. the hypothesis suggests a drastically different scenario with only hundreds of visitors per year, which contradicts the information in the premise. step 3. based on the discrepancy between the premise and hypothesis, it can be concluded that the hypothesis is not entailed by the premise."
2028,I wouldn't worry about my youngster.,Worry about my youngster.,0,0,True,"step 1: the premise expresses a statement of reassurance or lack of concern about someone referred to as 'my youngster'. this does not provide any information about the reason for the lack of worry or the current state of the youngster. step 2: the hypothesis suggests the opposite of the premise - a state of worry or concern about 'my youngster'. these two statements contradict each other. however, a contradiction does not necessarily mean that one statement cannot be inferred from the other under certain conditions. step 3: in natural language processing, it's important to consider the context, tone, and intentions behind the statements. the premise could be an expression of confidence or belief that there's no need to worry, while the hypothesis might represent a change in perspective or new information. if there's no additional context or information provided that could help resolve the contradiction, it's not possible to logically infer the hypothesis from the premise. in the absence of further context, both statements appear to be standalone expressions that contradict each other, so the hypothesis cannot be inferred from the premise.step 4: it's also worth noting that the premise and hypothesis might be from different perspectives or spoken by different people. in that case, they might not be directly comparable or logically related, and the hypothesis might not be able to be inferred from the premise.in summary, the hypothesis cannot be logically inferred from the premise based on the given information."
2029,"Despite the differences between the Chinese majority and the European minority, relations were generally cordial.","Due to major business interests, the Chinese felt the need to ally with them.",1,1,True,"step 1: in the premise, it is stated that despite the differences between the chinese majority and the european minority, relations were generally cordial. this implies that there was a peaceful coexistence or cooperation between the two groups, which could be due to various reasons. one possible reason is mutual benefits, such as business interests.step 2: the hypothesis suggests that the chinese felt the need to ally with the europeans due to major business interests. this hypothesis can be reasonably inferred from the premise, as the premise does not exclude this possibility and in fact, it hints towards it. the hypothesis adds specificity to the reason for the cordial relations mentioned in the premise.step 3: based on the logical reasoning and the lack of contradictory information, the hypothesis is entailed by the premise."
2030,Even knowing it was but a statue carved by man did little to reduce his wonder.,A man carved the statue of the deer.,1,1,True,"step 1: in the premise, the speaker expresses a strong sense of wonder towards a statue, despite knowing it was created by man. this implies that the statue is impressive or beautiful, and the speaker's emotional response is not diminished by this knowledge. step 2: the hypothesis states that a man carved the statue. this statement is consistent with the information in the premise, as the speaker acknowledges that it was 'carved by man'. step 3: though not a direct logical inference, the hypothesis can be seen as providing additional context that is consistent with the information in the premise. therefore, it does not contradict the premise and can be considered entailed if we accept that knowing 'a man carved it' does not change the speaker's reaction of wonder towards the statue.step 4: while the hypothesis and premise are not identical, they are related in that they both discuss the statue being carved by man. the hypothesis does not introduce any new information that contradicts the premise; instead, it provides more detail about the origin of the statue.step 5: given that the hypothesis is consistent with the premise and does not contradict it, and provides additional context, it can be considered entailed by the premise in a broader sense."
2031,okay maybe maybe we're all set okay we'll talk for five minutes they interrupt at the end um yeah it says what you would have for a dinner party i just happen to plan one out for Saturday i'll tell you what i'm going to have um,I prefer to plan dinner parties for Saturdays.,1,1,True,"step 1: in the premise, the speaker mentions planning a dinner party for saturday and expresses what they will serve for the dinner. step 2: the hypothesis indicates a preference for planning dinner parties on saturdays. the premise does not contradict this statement, as it does not mention any preferred day for planning dinner parties apart from the specific instance mentioned. step 3: based on the information given, the hypothesis can be inferred from the premise as it can be logically deduced that if someone is planning a dinner party for a specific day (saturday in this case), they likely have a preference for planning dinner parties on that day. therefore, the hypothesis is entailed by the premise. "
2032,well what about the what about the fact that it is right across the border in Mexico,it is right there in Mexico.,1,1,True,"step 1: in the premise, it is stated that 'it' is right across the border in mexico. this means that the object or location 'it' refers to is physically located on the mexican side of the border. step 2: the hypothesis states that 'it' is 'right there' in mexico, which maintains the physical location of 'it' in mexico. since the premise already establishes this fact, the hypothesis can be logically inferred from the premise. step 3: based on the logical reasoning and factual consistency, the hypothesis is entailed by the premise."
2033,She agrees with me that one must set an example of economy. ,Someone should show therm how its done. ,1,1,True,"step 1: in the premise, 'she' and 'i' agree that 'one must set an example of economy'. this implies that both 'she' and 'i' believe in the importance of being economical. 'setting an example' typically means demonstrating a behavior or action for others to follow.step 2: the hypothesis suggests that 'someone' should 'show her how it's done'. this is a logical implication of the premise. by agreeing that 'one must set an example of economy', 'she' and 'i' are acknowledging that there is a need for someone to demonstrate economical behavior. the hypothesis simply states that 'someone' should perform this role.step 3: based on the logical connection between the premise and hypothesis, the hypothesis can be inferred from the premise."
2034,An accordion player with a cowboy hat plays his instrument as he looks off into the distance.,A man playing a violin serenades a lover.,0,0,True,"step 1. in the premise, we have an accordion player with a cowboy hat engaging in musical performance by looking off into the distance. this scene does not necessarily imply a specific emotion or reason for playing. the presence of a cowboy hat does not directly relate to the type of music being played or the intention behind it.step 2. in the hypothesis, we have a man playing a violin and serenading a lover. this scenario involves a different instrument, music genre, and situation. the hypothesis does not logically follow from the premise as there is no shared key information or relationships.step 3. based on the given information, there is no logical entailment between the premise and hypothesis. the hypothesis is not a necessary or reasonable inference from the premise."
2035,i don't either but uh what i suspect is that illegals were hired for a hundred and fifty years of Texas history i don't think they can stop it by a federal edict i don't think the federal government can stop it by making by waving their magic wand and saying it will happen no more it's just too inbred in the culture you know,There were too many people here illegally. ,1,1,True,"step 1: the premise expresses the speaker's opinion that illegal hiring has been prevalent in texas history for over a century, and it is unlikely that the federal government can stop it. this implies a large number of people entering and working illegally in texas.step 2: the hypothesis, 'there were too many people here illegally,' can be inferred from the premise, as the premise's statement about illegal hiring and the culture indicates that a significant number of people have been involved in this issue.step 3: based on the information provided in the premise and common sense understanding, the hypothesis can be inferred from the premise."
2036,"Just beyond is a carved tomb with a pyramid-shaped roof, known as both the Tomb of the Pharaoh's Daughter and the Tomb of Zechariah.",The tomb has no carvings on it.,0,0,True,"step 1: in the premise, it is stated that the tomb has a pyramid-shaped roof and is known by two names - tomb of the pharaoh's daughter and tomb of zechariah. no information is provided about any carvings on the tomb. the names don't indicate the presence or absence of carvings. common sense suggests that a tomb with a history and cultural significance like this one would typically have carvings, and no factual information in the premise contradicts this assumption.step 2: the hypothesis, 'the tomb has no carvings on it', contradicts the information that could be reasonably inferred from the premise. the premise does not entail the hypothesis, as the presence or absence of carvings is not mentioned in the premise.step 3: based on the logical reasoning, the lack of information about carvings in the premise, and common sense understanding of historical tombs, the hypothesis 'the tomb has no carvings on it' is not entailed by the premise."
2037,"Dobson's partner Gary Bauer took to the Sunday talking-head circuit, bad-mouthing Reed for backpedaling on abortion.",Reed is a hypocrite. ,1,1,True,"step 1: in the premise, gary bauer is criticizing reed for changing his stance on abortion. a hypocrite is typically defined as someone who says one thing but does another, or says one thing but believes another, contrary to their actions or words. step 2: the hypothesis 'reed is a hypocrite' follows logically from the premise because the premise establishes that reed has indeed said one thing (supported abortion) but is now doing or intending to do another (backpedaling on abortion). step 3: based on the logical connection between the premise and hypothesis, and the definition of a hypocrite, the hypothesis can be inferred from the premise."
2038,i mean if you look at the average family it's like man they barely have time to stop and get gas much less to try and figure out how much gas they're really getting and do all this and it's like  i mean come on let's take the pressure off,The average family has more than enough time to determine the amount of gas they are actually receiving,0,0,True,"step 1: the premise expresses the opinion that the average family is too busy to calculate the exact amount of gas they are getting. it does not provide any specific facts or figures about the amount of time families have or the complexity of the process of determining gas amounts. step 2: the hypothesis, on the other hand, asserts a contrary fact, stating that the average family has more than enough time to calculate the exact amount of gas they are receiving. this is a direct contradiction to the premise. step 3: based on the given information, the hypothesis cannot be logically inferred from the premise as it contradicts the premise's assertion."
2039,"The folks weren't there anymore and I wanted to see what it was like.""",The folks were all still there.,0,0,True,"step 1: the premise describes a situation where 'the folks' were not present, indicating an absence. the speaker then expresses their desire to see what it was like, implying that they are currently not observing the scene. step 2: the hypothesis contradicts the premise by stating that 'the folks were all still there', suggesting a presence. step 3: based on the information provided, it is clear that the hypothesis cannot be logically inferred from the premise as it goes against the stated facts."
2040,um quality of the food,There was a lot of food. ,0,1,False,"step 1: in the premise, 'the quality of the food' is mentioned, but it does not specify the quantity of food. however, the absence of information about the quantity does not negate the possibility of a large amount of food. common sense and logical reasoning suggest that a good quality of food could mean an abundant or generous quantity. step 2: the hypothesis, 'there was a lot of food,' can be inferred from the premise because 'good quality of food' is not necessarily mutually exclusive with 'a lot of food.' a good quality of food could be presented in large quantities. step 3: based on the logical reasoning and common sense, the hypothesis 'there was a lot of food' can be inferred from the premise 'um quality of the food.' "
2041,yeah uh i yeah that's true that's true we did we did and uh do you all do you all uh do you all have to water a lot over there,I know it's dry there.,0,1,False,"step 1. in the premise, it is stated that 'we did have to water a lot over there'. this implies that the location in question is dry or requires a significant amount of water. common sense and factual knowledge suggest that a dry environment is a condition where watering is necessary.step 2. the hypothesis 'i know it's dry there' can be logically inferred from the premise because the premise establishes that the location is in need of watering due to dryness. the hypothesis is a logical consequence of the information provided in the premise.step 3. based on the logical reasoning and the lack of contradictory information, the hypothesis can be inferred from the premise."
2042,"Normally it is three to four weeks,"" said Ca'daan.",Ca'daan said it's usually between one and two weeks.,0,0,True,"step 1: the premise states that ca'daan said 'it is three to four weeks'. this sets the context for ca'daan's statement. step 2: the hypothesis presents a contradictory statement, saying 'ca'daan said it's usually between one and two weeks'. contradictory statements cannot be logically inferred from each other. step 3: based on the logical principle that contradictory statements cannot be logically inferred from each other, the hypothesis is not entailed by the premise."
2043,i think that's mine,You think that is yours but it's actually mine.,1,1,True,"step 1: both the premise and hypothesis are about the belief or perception of ownership. in the premise, 'i think that's mine', the speaker is expressing their belief that an object belongs to them. in the hypothesis, 'you think that is yours but it's actually mine', the hypothesis suggests that another person may believe the object is theirs, but the speaker asserts that it is truly theirs.step 2: the hypothesis can be considered as a clarification or correction of the premise. if the other person does indeed believe the object is theirs, then the hypothesis logically follows from the premise as it provides additional information about the other person's incorrect belief and the speaker's correct ownership.step 3: based on the logical relationship between the two statements and the common-sense understanding that people can have mistaken beliefs about ownership, the hypothesis can be inferred from the premise.step 4: additionally, the hypothesis does not contradict the premise, but instead adds more detail to it, further supporting the entailment."
2044,"Naturally, she told him.","No, get lost he told her.",0,0,True,"step 1: 'naturally, she told him' implies that she communicated something to him in a manner that seemed natural or appropriate under the circumstances. the phrase 'naturally' does not provide any specific information about the content or tone of the communication. 'get lost' is a direct and impolite command meaning to leave someone or go away.step 2: the hypothesis 'no, get lost he told her' contradicts the premise. if the sentence 'no, get lost he told her' was true, then 'naturally, she told him' would not be. the two sentences convey opposing meanings.step 3: based on the analysis, the hypothesis 'no, get lost he told her' is not entailed by the premise 'naturally, she told him'. in fact, the hypothesis contradicts the premise."
2045,Did Loral harm national security?,National security was not in danger. ,0,0,True,"step 1: in the premise, there is a question about loral potentially harming national security. this raises the possibility that loral's actions or behavior could pose a threat to national security. however, the premise itself does not provide any definitive answer or information about the current state of national security or the presence or absence of harm. step 2: the hypothesis states that national security was not in danger. this directly contradicts the potential scenario raised in the premise where harm to national security is a possibility. step 3: based on the given information, the hypothesis cannot be logically inferred from the premise as it contradicts the potential implications of the premise. furthermore, there might be several reasons why national security could have been in danger or not, which are not mentioned in the premise, making it impossible to infer the hypothesis from the premise alone. step 4: the hypothesis is not entailed by the premise."
2046,"On the opposite side of town in the Barrio San Blas is the smaller Castillo de San Fernando, begun during the War of Independence (1808-1814).",Castillo de San Fernando costs $200 per night.,1,0,False,"step 1. in the premise, we have information about the location, name, and history of castillo de san fernando. no information is provided about the cost to stay there. step 2. the hypothesis introduces a new piece of information about the cost of staying at castillo de san fernando. step 3. based on the provided information, there is no logical connection or entailment between the premise and hypothesis. the premise does not provide any information about the costs, and the hypothesis introduces new information that is not derived from the premise. therefore, the hypothesis cannot be logically inferred from the premise."
2047,Two females and one male looking at various merchandise.,Two girls and one man are browsing the store.,1,1,True,"step 1: in the premise, we have three individuals identified as females. the term 'females' implies that they are girls or women. the presence of one male also is mentioned. no age is explicitly stated for the males. however, the term 'girls' is synonymous with 'young girls' or 'female children'. the term 'women' refers to adult females. since the ages of the females are not specified, it's reasonable to assume that some of them could be girls and others women. the presence of a male does not contradict the hypothesis. step 2: the hypothesis suggests two girls and one man. since some of the females in the premise can be girls, the hypothesis is a logical implication of the premise. step 3: based on the logical relationship between the terms 'females' and 'girls', and the fact that the hypothesis does not contradict the premise, the hypothesis can be inferred from the premise."
2048,"But none of us should leave the room without an understanding that for parents all over the country, the fear is real, the problems of raising kids are real.",IT is easy going to raise children.,0,0,True,"step 1: in the premise, the speaker mentions that parents all over the country have real fears and problems when it comes to raising kids. this implies that raising children is not an easy task and that it comes with challenges. step 2: the hypothesis, 'it is easy to raise children', directly contradicts the premise by implying that raising children is an easy task, which is contrary to the common experience and fears shared by parents as stated in the premise. there's no logical or factual basis to infer the hypothesis from the premise. step 3: based on the logical reasoning and common sense, the hypothesis is not entailed by the premise."
2049,"Chapters 3 and 4 review, in the same fashion, the resource requirements of installing NOX and mercury control technology, respectively.",The book recommends the installation performed be reviewed and approved by a green energy professional because an error in installation can damage the expensive technology and pose a fire hazard to your home. ,1,1,True,"step 1: in the premise, it is mentioned that chapters 3 and 4 review the resource requirements of installing nox and mercury control technology, respectively. this implies that the book is providing instructions or guidelines for installing these technologies. step 2: the hypothesis suggests that the installation process should be reviewed and approved by a green energy professional. this recommendation is a common safety practice for installing complex and expensive technological systems, especially those involving potential hazards such as nox (nitric oxide emissions) and mercury control technology. such systems can pose risks if not installed correctly, leading to damage to the technology itself and potential hazards like fires. step 3: given that the premise is discussing the installation process of these technologies and the hypothesis is a safety recommendation related to the installation process, it is reasonable to infer that the hypothesis follows logically from the premise. the hypothesis adds an important safety precaution to the installation instructions provided in the premise. step 4: thus, based on the given information and logical reasoning, the hypothesis can be inferred from the premise."
2050,"Is there anything the matter, Aunt Emily? asked Cynthia. ","Are you warm enough, Aunt Emily? asked Cynthia.",0,1,False,"step 1: both sentences involve cynthia asking a question to aunt emily. the questions in both sentences express concern for aunt emily's well-being. they are grammatically similar, and the difference between them lies only in the specific aspects of well-being they address.step 2: being warm enough is a reasonable concern related to well-being, and it is a common question asked when someone notices that another person seems uncomfortable or cold. this behavior shows consideration and care for the other person's comfort.step 3: given that the premise and hypothesis both involve cynthia expressing concern for aunt emily's well-being, the hypothesis can be logically inferred from the premise. the difference in the specific aspects of well-being addressed in each sentence does not change the overall meaning or logical relationship between them.step 4: based on the logical reasoning and common sense, the hypothesis is entailed by the premise."
2051,"She was 96 just turning away when she heard a piercing whistle, and the faithful Albert came running from the building to join her.",It was eerily silent when she saw Albert running towards her. ,0,0,True,"step 1: in the premise, we have the information that a piercing whistle was heard and albert came running from a building to join an elderly woman. there is no mention of any unusual silence in the premise. common sense suggests that the presence of a loud whistle would not necessarily imply silence. a whistle and running footsteps are distinct sounds.step 2: the hypothesis, 'it was eerily silent when she saw albert running towards her,' contradicts the premise. albert's running and the whistle sound are not silent events.step 3: based on the information provided, the hypothesis cannot be logically inferred from the premise, as the premise explicitly states that there was a whistle sound and albert running, which contradicts the hypothesis of silence.label: 0"
2052,"If it doesn't wake up soon, another scandalous case will inevitably surface, and the government will take matters into its own hands.",The government will stay out of this business no matter what.,0,0,True,"step 1: in the premise, it is suggested that there is a potential scandal and that if it isn't resolved soon, the government will intervene. this implies that the government has the power and the inclination to act when necessary. step 2: the hypothesis states that the government will not get involved, which is directly contradictory to the premise. the premise indicates that the government will only stay out of the business if the situation doesn't call for its involvement. step 3: based on the logical analysis, the hypothesis cannot be inferred from the premise, as they are contradictory."
2053,"Silently, I praised Daniel's skill.",I did not praise Daniel for anything.,0,0,True,"step 1: the premise indicates that i praised daniel, but it does not provide any information about the reason for the praise. the hypothesis states that i did not praise daniel for anything. step 2: the hypothesis does not contradict the premise directly, as the premise does not mention what daniel was praised for. step 3: however, the hypothesis goes beyond the information given in the premise by implying that there was no reason for the praise at all. without that detail in the premise, it is not possible to logically infer the hypothesis from it. step 4: in general, praising someone for a skill is a common way of expressing approval or admiration, and it does not necessarily imply that there is any specific thing being praised. the hypothesis, on the other hand, asserts that there was no reason for the praise whatsoever. this is not a logical conclusion that can be drawn from the given premise. step 5: therefore, the hypothesis is not logically entailed by the premise."
2054,I tipped it upside down.,I was angry and turned it over.,1,0,False,"step 1: the premise states that you tipped something upside down. this action itself does not provide much context about the reason for performing it. step 2: the hypothesis suggests that you were angry and turned something over. while there is no direct connection between the premise and hypothesis, the suggested emotion (anger) can be a reason for turning an object upside down. it is a common action associated with expressing frustration or upset. step 3: although the premise itself does not entail the hypothesis, the hypothesis is a plausible explanation for the observed action (tipping it over) in the premise. common sense and logical principles suggest that a person might be angry and turn something over, and this possibility is not contradicted by the given information."
2055,If something akin to,Maybe something unrelated to.,0,0,True,"step 1: in the premise, 'if something akin to hypothesis' is a conditional statement. 'akin to hypothesis' implies a similarity or relationship between the condition and the hypothesis. however, the condition is incomplete and does not provide sufficient information to make a definite conclusion. 'maybe something unrelated' suggests a possibility that the hypothesis could be unrelated to the condition. step 2: without knowing the exact relationship between 'if something akin to hypothesis' and 'maybe something unrelated', it is impossible to logically infer the hypothesis from the premise. the hypothesis could be related or unrelated. step 3: based on the given information, the hypothesis cannot be definitively inferred from the premise."
2056,i guess the uh this this is my first conversation in this uh uh series,I've had many conversations before in this series.,0,0,True,"step 1: in the premise, the speaker explicitly states that 'this is my first conversation in this uh uh series'. this statement is clear and unambiguous. step 2: the hypothesis contradicts the premise, as it states that the speaker 'i' has had 'many conversations before in this series'. step 3: based on the given information, the hypothesis cannot be logically inferred from the premise, as they present conflicting statements."
2057,"The town is ideal for a quiet family holiday, especially in spring, when Javea is magical with the scents of lemon and orange blossoms.",The town is very industrial and no one vacations there.,0,0,True,"step 1: in the premise, the town is described as being ideal for a quiet family holiday, particularly in spring, when it is filled with the pleasant scents of lemon and orange blossoms. this suggests a peaceful and charming atmosphere. step 2: the hypothesis states that the town is very industrial and no one vacations there. this contradicts the information in the premise, as industrial towns are not typically ideal for quiet family holidays or associated with pleasant scents of blooming flowers. step 3: based on the logical inconsistency between the premise and hypothesis, the hypothesis cannot be inferred from the premise."
2058,"The album was recorded at World Class Audio in Anaheim and The Pool House in Fullerton, California.","The album was recorded at World Class Audio in Anaheim and The Pool House in Bow, California.",0,0,True,"step 1. in the premise, it is stated that the album was recorded at two specific locations: world class audio in anaheim and the pool house in fullerton, both in california. no further information about the nature of the recording or the context is provided. step 2. in the hypothesis, the two locations remain the same as in the premise: world class audio in anaheim and the pool house. however, the second location is erroneously identified as being in bow, california, instead of fullerton, california. step 3. although the hypothesis is similar to the premise, it is not logically entailed by the premise because of the incorrect location information in the hypothesis. the hypothesis contradicts the premise on a factual level, as the location 'the pool house' is incorrectly identified in the hypothesis."
2059,I want you to mark him.,He should be let free with no marks on him.,0,0,True,"step 1: the premise indicates a desire or instruction to mark 'him'. marking can refer to various actions, such as writing, painting, or physically marking an object or person. it does not provide any information about the reason for marking or the nature of 'him'. step 2: the hypothesis suggests the opposite action, wanting 'him' to be free without any marks. there is no logical connection between the premise and hypothesis based on the given information. common sense indicates that the hypothesis cannot be inferred from the premise, as the premise does not suggest or imply the need to remove marks from 'him'. step 3: based on the given information, the hypothesis is not entailed by the premise."
2060,3 examines the long-term outlook for federal government saving/dissaving.,1 and 2 examine different features of a similar subject.,1,1,True,"step 1: in the premise, '3 examines the long-term outlook for federal government saving/dissaving', the subject is '3' examining the 'long-term outlook for federal government saving/dissaving'. in the hypothesis, '1 and 2 examine different features of a similar subject', the subjects are '1 and 2' examining 'different features of a similar subject'. the similarity between the premise and hypothesis lies in both dealing with subjects that examine various aspects of the federal government.step 2: the hypothesis can be logically inferred from the premise because the premise does not limit '3' to examining only one specific feature of the federal government's saving/dissaving. it is possible that '1' and '2' are two different individuals or works also examining different features of the same subject.step 3: based on the logical reasoning and the lack of contradictory information, the hypothesis can be inferred from the premise."
2062,"Studio 54 delivered this critical mass almost every night, plus another 1,500 or so people who were simply beautiful or interesting to look at, plus Haden-Guest and me.",Studio 54 was only attended by a small handful of people every night.,0,0,True,"step 1: in the premise, studio 54 is described as delivering a critical mass of people almost every night, with an additional 1,500 people who were beautiful or interesting. this implies a large number of attendees. step 2: the hypothesis states that studio 54 was only attended by a small handful of people every night. this directly contradicts the information in the premise, which states a large number of attendees. step 3: based on the given information, the hypothesis cannot be logically inferred from the premise as it contradicts it."
2063,The tenancy of the commission was from 1964 to 1966 and the report was submitted by the commission on 29 June 1966.,The tenancy of the commission was from 1965 to 1966 and the report was submitted by the commission on 29 June 1966.,0,1,False,"step 1: in the premise, the commission's tenancy is stated to be from 1964 to 1966, and the report submission is stated to occur on 29 june 1966. no logical connections or contradictions are immediately apparent between these statements. commonsense reasoning does not indicate any issues with the premise or hypothesis.step 2: the hypothesis suggests a slight modification to the premise, changing the first year of the commission's tenancy from 1964 to 1965. this modification does not contradict the report submission date or any other information in the premise.step 3: based on the lack of contradictory information and the logical consistency of the hypothesis with the premise, the hypothesis can be considered a logical inference from the premise. the slight modification in the hypothesis does not alter the original meaning or implications of the premise.step 4: although the premise and hypothesis are worded slightly differently, they convey the same essential meaning. the hypothesis can be considered an entailment of the premise because it is a valid logical consequence that does not alter the original premise's intended meaning.label: 1"
2064,"(A bigger contribution may or may not mean, I really, really support Candidate X.) Freedom of association is an even bigger stretch--one that Justice Thomas would laugh out of court if some liberal proposed it.",Justice Thomas wanted to have freedom of association.,0,0,True,"step 1. the premise discusses the idea that a bigger contribution does not necessarily mean one 'really, really' supports a candidate. it then introduces the concept of 'freedom of association' and implies that this idea is a far-fetched or unrealistic proposition. the context suggests that the speaker finds this idea implausible. step 2. the hypothesis asserts that justice thomas wanted 'freedom of association'. while the premise does not directly relate to justice thomas or this concept, it does not contradict the hypothesis. freedom of association is a well-established legal principle, and the premise does not state that justice thomas did not support this principle. step 3. the hypothesis cannot be logically inferred from the premise as the premise does not provide enough information to make that conclusion. the hypothesis introduces a new subject (justice thomas) and a new concept (freedom of association), which are not mentioned in the premise."
2066,Drawing blood and confronting patients with their blood alcohol levels may actually push them away from counseling.,"When patients are confronted with their levels of blood alcohol, they are less likely to seek counseling.",0,1,False,"step 1: in the premise, it is suggested that drawing blood and confronting patients with their blood alcohol levels may deter them from counseling. this implies a causal relationship between the blood alcohol confrontation and the patient's decision not to seek counseling. step 2: the hypothesis states that when patients are confronted with their levels of blood alcohol, they are less likely to seek counseling. this is consistent with the causal relationship mentioned in the premise. inferring that patients are less likely to seek counseling when confronted with their blood alcohol levels is a logical consequence of the premise. step 3: based on the logical reasoning, the hypothesis is entailed by the premise."
2067,But repair our sky and we can reward you beyond your dreams.,The sky is broken from the magical spells of the enemy.,1,0,False,"step 1: in the premise, there is an offer to 'repair our sky.' this implies that the sky is currently in a state of disrepair. the cause of this condition is not explicitly stated in the premise. however, the hypothesis suggests that the sky is 'broken from the magical spells of the enemy.'step 2: the hypothesis is not logically entailed by the premise. while the premise does not contradict the hypothesis, there is no direct evidence or logical connection between the two. the cause of the sky's condition is unknown in the premise, and the hypothesis introduces a new cause (magical spells from an enemy) not mentioned in the premise.step 3: based on the given information, the hypothesis cannot be logically inferred from the premise."
2068,A man riding a bicycle on pavement with graffiti.,A man is outside,1,1,True,"step 1: in the premise, a man is performing an action (riding a bicycle) on a specific location (pavement with graffiti). this setting implies that the man is outside, as the terms 'pavement' and 'graffiti' are typically associated with the outdoors. step 2: the hypothesis 'a man is outside' is a general statement that is logically equivalent to the information provided in the premise. the hypothesis is not providing any new information that goes beyond the premise, but rather it is capturing the same information in a different way. step 3: based on the logical equivalence between the hypothesis and the premise, the hypothesis is entailed by the premise."
2069,"She called Legal Aid after months of wrangling with federal bureaucrats who denied her request for financial help -- about $6,000 a year -- to provide speech therapy for her 2-year-old son, who was born with autism.",Legal Aid denied her request to get speech therapy for her son.,0,0,True,"step 1: in the premise, it is stated that she had to call legal aid after months of struggling with federal bureaucrats to secure financial help for her son's speech therapy, which was denied. the amount mentioned, $6,000 a year, indicates that the financial assistance she sought was to cover the cost of this therapy. step 2: the hypothesis suggests that legal aid itself denied her request for speech therapy. this directly contradicts the information presented in the premise, as the premise states that she had to call legal aid because her request had been denied by the federal bureaucrats, not legal aid itself. step 3: based on the given information, the hypothesis cannot be logically inferred from the premise as it contradicts the stated facts."
2070,yeah of course they're uh they're probably going to set it up for some kind of sequel or something in the future and uh,I've seen better movies but they're probably preparing for a sequel to that one already. ,1,0,False,"step 1: the premise expresses the speaker's belief that the movie being discussed might have a sequel. it does not provide any specific information about the quality of the movie or the existence of a sequel. step 2: the hypothesis also refers to the possibility of a sequel but expresses the speaker's opinion that they have seen better movies. the hypothesis does not contradict the premise since the presence of a sequel is not guaranteed by the premise, but rather a possibility. step 3: based on the given information, there is no logical entailment between the premise and hypothesis. a possible inference from the premise does not guarantee that the hypothesis is true."
2071,"The results of even the most well designed epidemiological studies are characterized by this type of uncertainty, though well-designed studies typically report narrower uncertainty bounds around the best estimate than do studies of lesser quality.",Most studies are not planned well.,1,0,False,"step 1: in the premise, uncertainty in results is acknowledged, especially in studies of lesser quality. however, it is also stated that well-designed studies report narrower uncertainty bounds. this implies that there is a relationship between the quality of a study and the degree of uncertainty in its results. it is reasonable to assume that a higher quality study would have a more precise outcome.step 2: the hypothesis asserts that most studies are not planned well. this directly contradicts the premise's assumption that well-designed studies exist. the hypothesis suggests that the majority of studies are of lesser quality, which contradicts the premise's statement that well-designed studies report narrower uncertainty bounds.step 3: based on the information provided, the hypothesis cannot be logically inferred from the premise. the premise acknowledges uncertainty in study results but also acknowledges the existence of well-designed studies with narrower uncertainty bounds. the hypothesis makes a blanket statement about most studies being poorly planned and contradicts this premise."
2073,The two sets of estimates depicted in this table reflect alternative assumptions and analytical approaches regarding quantifying and evaluating the effects of airborne particles on public health.,Whatever in the table is not remotely relevant to alternative assumptions or analytical approaches for anything.,0,0,True,"step 1: the premise describes two sets of estimates related to the effects of airborne particles on public health with different assumptions and analytical approaches. it does not provide any specific information about what is or isn't relevant in the table. step 2: the hypothesis states that whatever is not relevant to alternative assumptions or analytical approaches should be disregarded. however, the premise does not define or specify what 'whatever' refers to in the table. the hypothesis, thus, is too vague to be logically inferred from the premise. step 3: based on the lack of clear connection between the premise and hypothesis, the hypothesis cannot be logically inferred from the premise."
2074,so how long are we suppose to talk for,so I'm not suppose to talk at all?,0,0,True,"step 1: in the premise, there is an open-ended question about the duration of a conversation. there is no mention of any condition or instruction for not talking at all. step 2: the hypothesis is a statement that contradicts the premise by suggesting that there is a condition for not talking at all. however, the premise does not provide any information that would logically entail this condition. step 3: based on the information given, the hypothesis is not logically entailed by the premise."
2075,"The movie doesn't come to much, though.",There was a lot to this movie.,0,0,True,"step 1: the premise expresses a negative evaluation of the movie, suggesting that it doesn't have much substance or significance. step 2: the hypothesis expresses a positive evaluation of the movie, suggesting that it had a lot to offer. these evaluations contradict each other. step 3: contradictory hypotheses cannot be logically inferred from their contradictory premises. since the hypothesis contradicts the premise, it cannot be inferred. step 4: inference requires logical consistency between the premise and hypothesis. in this case, the contradiction prevents logical inference."
2076,"You get a notion of the magnificence of Burgundian court life by starting your visit with the ducal kitchens, built in 1435, which boast six enormous walk-in cooking hearths.",The ducal kitchens were built in 1435 with no real points of interest.,0,0,True,"step 1: in the premise, it is stated that the ducal kitchens were built in 1435 and they have six enormous walk-in cooking hearths. this information establishes the existence and age of the kitchens, as well as their grandeur and functionality.step 2: the hypothesis directly contradicts the premise by suggesting that the kitchens have no points of interest, which is not stated or implied in the premise. while there is no explicit statement about the 'points of interest' in the premise, the mention of the 'magnificence' of burgundian court life and the 'grandeur' of the kitchens implies that they are significant and interesting.step 3: based on the logical analysis and the common-sense understanding of the text, the hypothesis is not entailed by the premise. in fact, it contradicts the premise."
2077,"Well, of course the war has turned the hundreds into thousands. ",Too many people died in the was. ,1,1,True,"step 1: in the premise, it is stated that the war has turned 'hundreds' into 'thousands'. this implies a significant increase in the number of people affected by the war. step 2: the hypothesis suggests that 'too many people died in the war'. dying is one way for the number of people in a population to increase significantly. therefore, the hypothesis is logically related to the premise. step 3: based on the logical connection identified, and the fact that the premise and hypothesis both concern the number of people affected by the war, the hypothesis can be inferred from the premise.step 4: it is also important to note that this inference is consistent with common sense and factual knowledge. wars are known to cause large numbers of casualties, and the premise's acknowledgment of this fact supports the hypothesis.step 5: furthermore, there is no contradictory information in the premise or hypothesis, so the hypothesis does not contradict the premise.therefore, based on the logical connection, common sense, and lack of contradictory information, the hypothesis is entailed by the premise."
2078,"Technology is transforming pro bono but there is a great deal to do, particularly as many legal assistance agencies still lack basic technology, such as Internet connections.",They all had high speed Internet connections.,0,0,True,"step 1: the premise describes the ongoing transformation of pro bono work by technology, acknowledging that many legal assistance agencies still lack basic technology like internet connections. this implies a need for technology upgrades in these agencies. step 2: the hypothesis contradicts the premise as it assumes that all these agencies already have high-speed internet connections. step 3: based on the given information, it is not logically inferable that all legal assistance agencies have high-speed internet connections."
2079,They crossed the Forth from Dunfermline at the narrows known to this day as Queensferry.,The narrows were renamed from Queensferry to Kingsferry.,0,0,True,"step 1: in the premise, 'they crossed the forth from dunfermline at the narrows known to this day as queensferry', the information provided refers to a historical event where people crossed the forth river at a narrow point named queensferry. step 2: the hypothesis suggests a renaming of the narrows from queensferry to kingsferry. however, the premise itself does not provide any information about a name change. step 3: given the information in the premise, there is no logical connection or entailment to the hypothesis. the hypothesis is not logically inferred from the premise."
2080,there's excuse me uh there's bumble patterns there's mosquito patterns there's wasp patterns there's grub patterns uh,There's bumble patterns on the lure to trick the fish.,1,1,True,"step 1: in the premise, various types of patterns are mentioned in relation to insects (bumble patterns, mosquito patterns, wasp patterns, grub patterns). the context suggests that these patterns are likely referring to the appearance or design of something, possibly bait or lures used for fishing. step 2: the hypothesis also mentions 'bumble patterns' but in the context of a lure being used to 'trick the fish'. this can be inferred as a logical implication from the premise, as having bumble patterns on a lure is a strategy used to mimic or attract specific types of fish that are drawn to bumblebee insects in real life. step 3: based on the logical connection between the premise and hypothesis, where the presence of bumble patterns in the lure is a reasonable and expected consequence given the information in the premise, the hypothesis can be logically inferred from the premise."
2081,"3 Participants attributed this lack of change to the financial reporting model being largely driven by the supply side, that is accountants, regulators, and corporate management and boards of directors.",Participants say that there has been a lot of changes,0,0,True,"step 1: in the premise, it is stated that participants attributed the lack of change to the financial reporting model being largely driven by the supply side. this implies that the actions or decisions of accountants, regulators, and corporate management and boards of directors have led to the lack of change. step 2: the hypothesis, 'participants say that there has been a lot of changes', is a contradiction to the premise. if participants are saying that there have been 'a lot of changes', it would go against the premise's assertion that there has been a lack of change. step 3: based on the logical contradiction between the premise and hypothesis, it is clear that the hypothesis cannot be logically inferred from the premise.step 4: it's essential to note that the premise only describes participants' attribution of the lack of change to the financial reporting model's supply side. it does not necessarily mean that no changes have occurred. changes may have happened but were either insignificant or not acknowledged by the participants. the hypothesis, on the other hand, only asserts that 'participants say' there have been changes, without providing any indication of the significance or scope of those changes.in conclusion, the hypothesis cannot be logically inferred from the premise since they are contradictory statements. "
2082,"In 1188 William Marshall gave land to build a priory at Cartmel, and during the Middle Ages it was a large and very wealthy concern.",William Marshall refused to hand over any of his land for the purposes of a priory.,0,0,True,"step 1. in the premise, it is stated that william marshall gave land to build a priory at cartmel during the middle ages, and this priory was a large and wealthy concern. step 2. the hypothesis suggests that william marshall refused to hand over any of his land for the purposes of a priory. this contradicts the information provided in the premise. step 3. based on the logical principle that a contradiction cannot be logically inferred from a premise, the hypothesis is not entailed by the premise."
2083,"It had never mattered to an Apache whether a man rode on the north or south side of the law if his skin was white, that automatically made him prey.",The Apache weighed a white man's character thoroughly before judging them.,0,0,True,"step 1: in the premise, it is stated that an apache's judgment of a man was not based on which side of the law a white man rode, but solely on his skin color. this implies that character judgments were not a priority for the apache. step 2: the hypothesis states that the apache weighed a white man's character thoroughly before judging them. this contradicts the information presented in the premise, as it suggests a different basis for judgment, implying that character assessment was important. step 3: based on the given premise, the hypothesis cannot be logically inferred, as the two statements are contradictory."
2084,'You killed my friend.,Why did you kill my best friend.,1,0,False,"step 1: the premise states an action 'you killed my friend.' it does not provide any information about the reason or motive for the action. the hypothesis, on the other hand, asks for a reason 'why did you kill my best friend.'step 2: the hypothesis cannot be logically inferred from the premise as the premise does not provide the necessary information for the hypothesis to be a valid conclusion. the hypothesis requests a reason or motive, whereas the premise only states an action.step 3: based on the given information, the hypothesis is not entailed by the premise."
2085,"The beautifully restored house contains some interesting furniture and plasterwork, and there is also a museum of rural life incorporating artisans' cottages with period furniture and tools.",The furnishing representing the eras fascinate most tourists who wish to take pictures of them.,1,1,True,"step 1: in the premise, we have a description of a beautifully restored house with some interesting furniture and plasterwork. additionally, there is a museum of rural life with period furniture and tools. this context suggests that the house and museum contain items from different eras. it is common sense that tourists are interested in taking pictures of fascinating and unique objects.step 2: the hypothesis 'the furnishing representing the eras fascinate most tourists who wish to take pictures of them' is consistent with the information in the premise. the hypothesis implies that tourists are interested in the furniture and tools due to their historical significance and aesthetic value, which aligns with the descriptions in the premise.step 3: based on the logical reasoning and common sense, the hypothesis can be inferred from the premise. the premise provides context about the nature of the items in the house and museum, and the hypothesis explains how tourists react to those items."
2086,"Maybe you'll never come to love me, and if that's the case I'll manage to set you free.",I will bring myself to set you free and forget you if you never manage to love me.,1,0,False,"step 1: in the premise, the speaker is expressing a concern about the possibility of not being loved and the subsequent implications. the hypothesis also involves the speaker taking action to set the other person free and forgetting them. step 2: the hypothesis is not a direct logical entailment of the premise, but they share a thematic similarity. both sentences revolve around the idea of the speaker coming to terms with a potential lack of love and taking action accordingly. in both cases, the speaker is considering releasing the other person from their relationship. step 3: however, the hypothesis goes beyond what is stated in the premise. the hypothesis adds the speaker's intention to bring themselves to set the other person free and forget them, which is not explicitly stated in the premise. thus, the hypothesis cannot be logically inferred from the premise as it contains additional information. step 4: it is important to note that the premise and hypothesis are written in the form of poetic expression or figurative language that may not follow strict logical rules. in this context, the sentences might be expressing related emotions or situations, but they don't necessarily imply a logical relationship.step 5: based on the analysis, it appears that the hypothesis cannot be logically inferred from the premise as it contains additional information, but they share thematic similarities and convey related emotions or situations."
2087,A girl in sunglasses smiles.,Smiling girl wearing sunglasses.,1,1,True,"step 1: in the premise, the key information is that a girl is smiling and wearing sunglasses. there is no contradiction or inconsistency in the premise. step 2: the hypothesis is identical to the premise in terms of content, as it also states that a girl is smiling and wearing sunglasses. the hypothesis can be considered a restatement or a rephrased version of the premise. step 3: given that the hypothesis and premise convey the same meaning, the hypothesis can be inferred from the premise. this is because the premise provides sufficient information for the conclusion in the hypothesis to be logically derived.step 4: (optional, for clarity) it's important to note that this example is different from other cases where the hypothesis is a more complex or abstract statement that needs to be inferred from a premise. in those cases, a more detailed thought process would be required to establish the logical relationship between the two. however, in this example, given the identity of the information in the premise and hypothesis, the inference is straightforward."
2088,One is by giving self-help assistance directly through our programs (such as with the I-CAN system and the statewide websites) and the second is by enhancing existing efforts on behalf of pro se clients.,Their programs offer no self-help.,0,0,True,"step 1: in the premise, it is stated that 'one is by giving self-help assistance directly.' this indicates that the organization provides self-help assistance through their programs. the second part of the premise also mentions 'enhancing existing efforts on behalf of pro se clients,' which does not contradict the provision of self-help. step 2: the hypothesis, 'their programs offer no self-help,' is a direct contradiction to the premise as the premise clearly states that they provide self-help assistance through their programs. step 3: based on the logical analysis, the hypothesis cannot be inferred from the premise as it contradicts the information provided."
2089,"The Dorians followed, installing themselves south of the Maeander, in the region known as Caria.","The Dorians installed themselves south of the Maeander, said the legend.",1,1,True,"step 1: the premise describes a historical fact about the dorians and their settlement in caria, specifically stating that they installed themselves south of the maeander river. no contradictory information is provided in the premise.step 2: the hypothesis repeats the information in the premise verbatim. since the premise is a factual statement, the hypothesis can be logically inferred from the premise as it does not add, remove, or change the information presented.step 3: based on the logical reasoning, the hypothesis is entailed by the premise."
2090,"FBI men installed microphones in King's Washington, D.C., hotel room and turned on the tape recorder.",The FBI hoped to catch King by wire tapping his Washington DC hotel room.,1,1,True,"step 1: in the premise, it is stated that fbi men installed microphones in martin luther king jr.'s washington, d.c., hotel room and turned on the tape recorder. this implies that the fbi was listening in on king's conversations in that room. step 2: the hypothesis proposes that the fbi hoped to catch king by wiretapping his washington d.c. hotel room. the key words here are 'hoping to catch' and 'wiretapping'. given that the premise indicates that the fbi indeed installed microphones in king's hotel room and recorded his conversations, it is reasonable to infer that the fbi's intention was to gather information, which is the essence of 'catching' someone in the context of surveillance. furthermore, the method they used to gather this information is described as 'wiretapping' in the hypothesis, which is precisely what the premise states they did. step 3: based on the logical reasoning, the hypothesis is entailed by the premise."
2091,That's what News Quiz players cite.,Players on News Quiz cite something completely different.,0,0,True,"step 1: in the premise, 'that's what news quiz players cite' suggests that there is a specific statement or fact that news quiz players often refer to. however, it does not provide any information about what that statement or fact is. the hypothesis, 'players on news quiz cite something completely different' suggests that the players might be referring to something other than what is generally known or assumed.step 2: the hypothesis does not necessarily contradict the premise, as the players could be citing something different but still related to the topic of news quiz. however, without further context or information, it is not possible to definitively infer the hypothesis from the premise.step 3: based on the given information, the hypothesis is not entailed by the premise. the premise only establishes that news quiz players cite something, while the hypothesis states that they cite something different. the two statements do not necessarily follow from one another."
2092,"WGUS - FM 102.7 is is part of the Augusta, Georgia radio market.","WGUS-FM 102.7 is a Southern Gospel radio station licensed to New Ellenton, South Carolina, but is part of the Augusta, Georgia radio market.",1,1,True,"step 1: in the premise, wgus-fm 102.7 is identified as part of the augusta, georgia radio market. this indicates that the station's broadcast signal reaches the augusta area. no specific information about the format or location of the station is given. step 2: the hypothesis adds that wgus-fm 102.7 is a southern gospel radio station licensed to new ellenton, south carolina. the premise does not contradict this information. in fact, a radio station's format and location can be independent of its market affiliation. step 3: based on the logical reasoning that a station's format and location are independent of its market affiliation, and the lack of contradictory information, the hypothesis can be inferred from the premise.step 4: it is important to note that the premise does not limit the radio stations in the augusta market to being based in augusta itself, or only broadcasting from augusta. therefore, the hypothesis that a southern gospel station from new ellenton is part of the augusta market is valid.step 5: in summary, the hypothesis does not contradict the premise and can be logically inferred from it based on the understanding that a radio station's format and location are independent of its market affiliation."
2093,None of the trials of alcohol interventions in emergency departments were published in journals likely to be encountered by emergency care providers.,None of the interventions will be implemented in your local ER.,1,0,False,"step 1: the premise states that no trials of alcohol interventions in emergency departments were published in journals that emergency care providers are likely to encounter. this implies that the intervention studies may not be easily accessible or known to these professionals. step 2: the hypothesis infers that since the interventions have not been published in accessible journals, they will not be implemented in a local er. this inference is based on the assumption that emergency care providers primarily rely on published research to inform their practice. step 3: the hypothesis is a logical consequence of the premise, as the lack of publication in accessible journals increases the likelihood that the interventions will not be implemented. however, it's important to note that other factors, such as the availability of resources, institutional policies, and the preferences of healthcare professionals, can also influence the implementation of interventions. the hypothesis may not hold true in all cases."
2094,a couple is walking down the sidewalk with their dog.,A couple is walking their cat to the vet.,0,0,True,"step 1: the premise describes a situation where a couple is walking with their dog on the sidewalk. this scene is common and does not contain any unusual or contradictory elements. step 2: the hypothesis presents an alternative scenario where the couple is walking a cat instead of a dog. however, the information given in the hypothesis contradicts the premise as the couple is not described as carrying or leading a cat in the premise. step 3: based on the logical analysis and common sense, the hypothesis 'a couple is walking their cat to the vet' cannot be inferred from the premise 'a couple is walking down the sidewalk with their dog' as the hypothesis presents a different and contradictory situation."
2095,Restricting LSC attorneys in advising their clients and in presenting arguments and analyses to the courts distorts the legal system by altering the traditional role of the attorneys in much the same way broadcast systems or student publication networks were changed in the limited forum cases we have cited.,Attorneys often work under stressful conditions and numerous restrictions.,1,0,False,"step 1: in the premise, it is argued that restricting lsc (legal services corporation) attorneys in advising their clients and presenting arguments in courts distorts the legal system. this implies that lsc attorneys typically have certain freedoms and roles in the legal system, but these restrictions alter their ability to fulfill these roles. the premise also mentions broadcast systems and student publication networks as analogies for this situation.step 2: the hypothesis 'attorneys often work under stressful conditions and numerous restrictions' is not directly inferred from the premise. however, it is a common fact that attorneys often face stressful conditions and various restrictions while performing their duties. this information is not contradictory to the premise and can be considered as additional context or background knowledge.step 3: the hypothesis itself does not entail or follow logically from the premise. the premise primarily discusses the issue of restrictions on lsc attorneys, and the hypothesis describes general conditions that attorneys deal with. though the hypothesis is related to the premise, it does not logically follow from it."
2096,"In the summer, the Sultan's Pool, a vast outdoor amphitheatre, stages rock concerts or other big-name events.",Most rock concerts take place in the Sultan's Pool amphitheatre.,1,1,True,"step 1: the premise states that the sultan's pool amphitheatre is used for staging rock concerts and other big-name events during the summer. this implies that a significant number of such events occur at the sultan's pool. step 2: the hypothesis, 'most rock concerts take place in the sultan's pool amphitheatre,' suggests that most or perhaps all rock concerts in the area occur at the sultan's pool. given the information in the premise, it is a logical conclusion that most rock concerts do indeed take place at the sultan's pool amphitheatre, as it is the primary venue for such events during the summer. step 3: based on the logical connection between the premise and hypothesis, common sense understanding, and factual consistency, the hypothesis can be inferred from the premise."
2097,"In the period 1980 through 1986, for example, and again 1993 through 2000, the annual rate of decline was only 1.7 percent.","Between 1986 and 1993, there were events that happened to increase the annual rate of decline.",1,0,False,"step 1: the premise provides information about specific time periods during which the annual rate of decline was relatively low at 1.7 percent. it does not, however, give any details about the reasons for this decline or any events that may have occurred during the intervening periods that could have influenced the rate of decline. step 2: the hypothesis suggests that there were events between 1986 and 1993 that caused an increase in the annual rate of decline. although the premise does not directly provide this information, it does not contradict the hypothesis either. step 3: based on the available information, it cannot be definitively determined if the hypothesis is entailed by the premise or not. the premise does not provide enough detail to either confirm or refute the hypothesis."
2098,"Until all members of our society are afforded that access, this promise of our government will continue to be unfulfilled.",The government is flawed and unfulfilled. ,1,1,True,"step 1: in the premise, it is stated that the promise of the government will remain unfulfilled as long as all members of society do not have access. this implies that the government has made a promise, but has not yet fully delivered on it. this is a common way to describe a government that is not functioning optimally or flawlessly. step 2: the hypothesis 'the government is flawed and unfulfilled' can be logically inferred from the premise as it directly conveys the same idea - that the government is not living up to its promises or expectations. step 3: based on the logical connection between the premise and hypothesis, and the lack of contradictory information, the hypothesis can be inferred from the premise."
2099,Man in overalls with two horses.,a man in overalls with two cows,0,0,True,"step 1: in the premise, we have a man and two horses. the man's attire, described as overalls, does not provide any specific information about his occupation or the context. horses are large animals often used for transportation, work, or recreation. no facts are given in the premise to contradict the hypothesis.step 2: in the hypothesis, we have a man with two cows instead of horses. cows are also large livestock animals commonly used for agriculture, milk production, or meat. there is no logical contradiction between the premise and hypothesis.step 3: based on the given information and logical reasoning, the hypothesis is not entailed by the premise. the premise describes horses, and the hypothesis describes cows, which are different animals. however, the lack of specific details about the man's occupation or the context in the premise allows for the possibility of the scenario described in the hypothesis, making it plausible but not logically following from the premise."
2100,"This mother and her daughter and granddaughter are having car trouble, and the poor little girl looks hot out in the heat.",The family is driving safe and sound while the little girl is asleep.,0,0,True,"step 1: in the premise, we have a mother, her daughter, and granddaughter who are experiencing car trouble and the little girl looks hot. the situation of car trouble and the heat do not necessarily imply danger or danger to the little girl. however, the statement that the little girl looks hot could raise concerns about her safety. but this information alone is not enough to determine if the family is in danger or not.step 2: the hypothesis states that the family is driving safely and the little girl is asleep. this hypothesis contradicts the information in the premise about car trouble. if the family is driving safely, then there should be no car trouble. thus, the hypothesis cannot be logically inferred from the premise.step 3: based on the given information, the hypothesis cannot be inferred from the premise as it contradicts the premise."
2101,"(He runs the NewsHour as if it were a Senate office and he, the senator, says one veteran of the show.)",The woman has a program called NewsPower.,0,0,True,"step 1: in the premise, it is mentioned that the man runs the newshour like a senate office and he is referred to as a senator. this implies that the man holds a position of authority over the newshour. the woman is not explicitly mentioned in the premise.step 2: in the hypothesis, it is stated that the woman has a program called newspower. this could mean that she produces or hosts a news program. the existence of such a program does not contradict the premise as there is no mention of any conflict between the man's control of the newshour and the woman having her own program.step 3: the hypothesis 'the woman has a program called newspower' can be inferred from the premise because having a news program does not contradict the man's control of the newshour as a senate office. in fact, it is common for broadcasting organizations to have multiple programs and personnel. so, the hypothesis can reasonably be inferred from the premise."
2102,A vast burning cloud of gas and steam bearing rocks and ashes roared down the mountainside onto the town.,The firestorm caused an immediate panic amongst the residents.,1,1,True,"step 1: in the premise, a large firestorm is described as moving down the mountainside towards a town. this scenario is known to be dangerous and frightening for people, as fires can cause extensive damage and put lives at risk. common sense and factual knowledge suggest that the residents would react with fear or panic upon witnessing such a destructive event. step 2: the hypothesis 'the firestorm caused an immediate panic amongst the residents' is a logical consequence of the premise. the fear or panic is a natural response to the dangerous situation described in the premise. step 3: based on the logical reasoning and common sense understanding, the hypothesis can be inferred from the premise."
2103,"Cretan civilians attacked them with knives, axes, scythes or even bare hands.","Cretan civilians picked off paratroopers or attacked them with knives, axes, scythes or even bare hands.",1,1,True,"step 1: in the premise, it is stated that cretan civilians attacked paratroopers with various weapons including knives, axes, scythes, and even bare hands. this indicates a violent confrontation between the two groups. step 2: the hypothesis also describes the same actions and weapons being used by cretan civilians against paratroopers. since the hypothesis uses the same information as the premise but focuses specifically on the method of attacking ('picked off' is a synonym for 'attacked' in this context), it can be logically inferred from the premise. step 3: based on the logical reasoning, the hypothesis can be inferred from the premise."
2104,or you know this month but one day because you know our bills will catch up with us if i am or you know i can't we can't go on a two week vacation because uh i wouldn't make any overtime in two weeks so that would really hurt us financially and you know just things like that all time and you know we we really see how we're,We have planned a three week vacation starting next weekend.,0,0,True,"step 1: in the premise, the speaker explains that they cannot afford a two-week vacation due to financial obligations such as bills and lack of overtime. the hypothesis presents a plan for a three-week vacation starting next weekend.step 2: the hypothesis contradicts the information in the premise, as it suggests a financial commitment for a longer vacation than what the speaker indicated they could afford. a three-week vacation would likely cost more than a two-week one and could potentially put additional financial strain on the speaker.step 3: based on the logical inconsistency between the premise and hypothesis, the hypothesis cannot be logically inferred from the premise. in fact, it contradicts the premise."
2105,"They're over quickly and forgotten by all--except, perhaps, their often hapless targets.","Everyone, even their targets, seem to forget over time.",0,1,False,"step 1: in the premise, it is stated that 'they're over quickly and forgotten by all--except, perhaps, their often hapless targets.' this suggests that an event or situation may be fleeting and forgotten by most people, but some individuals, possibly the direct recipients, might not forget. step 2: in the hypothesis, it is proposed that 'everyone, even their targets, seem to forget over time.' this statement is consistent with the information given in the premise. the hypothesis does not contradict the premise, as it extends the statement to include all individuals, including the targets. step 3: based on the logical consistency between the premise and hypothesis, the hypothesis can be inferred from the premise. both statements suggest that forgetting is a common occurrence, although the hypothesis generalizes this to include everyone, not just 'all' as stated in the premise."
2106,"But when it comes to the reality of the archaeological sites, nothing prepares you for their beauty, scale, and magnificence.","The archaeological sites are nothing too impressive, it's easy to be ready for them.",0,0,True,"step 1: in the premise, the speaker is expressing surprise and admiration for the beauty, scale, and magnificence of archaeological sites. this implies that the speaker had certain expectations that were exceeded.step 2: the hypothesis states that one can be 'ready for' or 'expect' that archaeological sites are not impressive. this directly contradicts the premise, as the premise indicates that the speaker was not ready for the impressive nature of the sites.step 3: based on the logical negation of the premise in the hypothesis, it is clear that the hypothesis cannot be inferred from the premise. the hypothesis goes against the information and the perspective expressed in the premise.step 4: the hypothesis is not entailed by the premise, and it contradicts the logical and factual elements of the premise."
2107,"For example, T and A data may be recorded (1) daily, (2) when deviations occur from an individual's or agency's established work schedule, or (3) at the end of the pay period.",All T and A data should be recorded on paper.,1,0,False,"step 1: in the premise, three different ways of recording t and a data are mentioned: daily, upon deviations from a schedule, and at the end of a pay period. no method is specified as the only valid one. common sense and logical analysis do not suggest that recording t and a data only on paper is a necessary part of the mentioned methods. step 2: the hypothesis 'all t and a data should be recorded on paper' is not logically inferred from the premise because the premise does not state or imply that recording on paper is the only valid or required method. step 3: based on the logical analysis and the lack of implication in the premise, the hypothesis cannot be inferred from the premise."
2108,i uh for the longest time i i'd gotten rid of my gas credit cards and then all of a sudden i started getting a flurry of these things so i i did i have picked up three gas credit cards in the last couple months,I refuse to pick up any gas credit cards.,0,0,True,"step 1: in the premise, the speaker mentions that they had gotten rid of their gas credit cards in the past but have since picked up three new ones in a short period. this information indicates a past action of getting rid of the cards and a recent action of acquiring new ones. there's no contradiction between these facts in the premise.step 2: the hypothesis states that the speaker refuses to pick up any gas credit cards. this is inconsistent with the information in the premise, as the speaker has clearly picked up three new gas credit cards recently.step 3: based on the logical analysis, the hypothesis cannot be inferred from the premise."
2109,my hand but oh i was scared to death i i i could see him cutting out my my whole palm just to get this little flap of skin out so that's that's how mechanical i am,"I can fix any car, any time. ",0,0,True,"step 1: in the premise, the speaker describes a personal experience involving fear and a procedure where someone was trying to cut a small piece of skin from their palm. this narrative does not provide any explicit information about the speaker's abilities or skills in fixing cars. however, the speaker's use of the metaphor 'mechanical' suggests a high level of precision and dexterity in performing small tasks. step 2: the hypothesis asserts that the speaker has the ability to fix any car at any time. while the premise does not directly provide evidence for this claim, the metaphor 'mechanical' in the premise implies a certain level of expertise and proficiency in performing detailed tasks. however, the premise does not necessarily entail the ability to fix cars, as the metaphor might not directly relate to car repair. step 3: based on the information provided, the hypothesis cannot be logically inferred from the premise as there is no explicit mention of car repair skills or experiences in the premise."
2110,An SBA official has confirmed that some agencies follow this practice without objection from SBA.,"The SBA has not objected to some agencies following this practice, though it is usually frowned on.",1,1,True,"step 1: in the premise, an sba official has confirmed that some agencies follow a certain practice without objection from the sba. this implies that there is a practice that some agencies engage in, which the sba is aware of and does not object to. step 2: the hypothesis suggests that the sba does not object to this practice, but also mentions that it is 'usually frowned on'. although the premise does not explicitly mention the general opinion about this practice, it does not contradict the hypothesis. step 3: based on the information provided, the hypothesis can be inferred from the premise as long as we understand that 'usually frowned on' does not necessarily mean that the sba always objects to the practice. the lack of contradictory information and the logical consistency between the premise and hypothesis support this conclusion."
2111,Suggestions have been offered in the United States that the most attractive customers of some presort firms are being charged a price in the neighborhood of one cent per piece.,The most attractive customers are being charged somewhere around five cents per piece.,0,0,True,"step 1: in the premise, it is mentioned that some presort firms in the united states have been suggested to charge attractive customers around one cent per piece. this implies that these customers are valuable or profitable for the firms, as they are being charged a lower price than usual. step 2: in the hypothesis, it is proposed that attractive customers are being charged around five cents per piece. this is not logically entailed by the premise, as the hypothesis presents a contradiction: the customers are suggested to be attractive and valuable, but the hypothesis states they are being charged a higher price. step 3: based on the given information, the hypothesis cannot be logically inferred from the premise, as the premise does not support the hypothesis."
2113,"But Japan was reluctant to sue for peace because the Allies were demanding unconditional surrender with no provision for maintaining the highly symbolic role of the emperor, still considered the embodiment of Japan's spirit and divine origins.",Japan immediately sued for peace when demands for unconditional surrender came from the Allies.,0,0,True,"step 1: in the premise, japan's reluctance to sue for peace is attributed to the allies' demand for unconditional surrender without any provision for the emperor's role. the emperor was a symbol of japan's spirit and divine origins, making this a significant concern for japan.step 2: the hypothesis asserts that japan immediately sued for peace when the allies made demands for unconditional surrender. this is a direct contradiction to the information presented in the premise. the premise states that japan was reluctant to sue for peace due to the allies' demands, not that japan immediately did so.step 3: based on the given information and logical principles, the hypothesis cannot be logically inferred from the premise as it directly contradicts it."
2114,yeah uh but i well i'm still trying to get all the DMC colors,I don't have any of the DMC colors. ,0,0,True,"step 1: in the premise, the speaker mentions that they are 'still trying to get all the dmc colors'. this implies that they do not currently have all the dmc colors but are in the process of obtaining them.step 2: the hypothesis states that 'i don't have any of the dmc colors'. this directly contradicts the premise, as the premise asserts that the speaker has some but not all of the dmc colors, while the hypothesis states that they have none.step 3: based on the logical analysis, the hypothesis cannot be inferred from the premise as they contradict each other."
2115,"First clue, we know one of the gang.",We do not know anyone of the gang.,0,0,True,"step 1: the premise states that 'we know one of the gang.' this means there is at least one member of the gang that is known to the speaker or the group they represent. step 2: the hypothesis contradicts the premise by stating 'we do not know anyone of the gang.' therefore, the hypothesis cannot be logically inferred from the premise as it is a direct contradiction. step 3: based on the logical negation of the premise by the hypothesis, the hypothesis is not entailed by the premise."
2116,"Racing to Springfield Elementary, Otto crashes the school bus and is suspended until he can get his license back.","Racing to Springfield Elementary, Otto crashes the school bus and is suspended until he can leave his license back.",0,0,True,"step 1. in the premise, otto crashes the school bus while rushing to springfield elementary. the hypothesis also describes otto rushing to springfield elementary and crashing the school bus, but it suggests that he is suspended until he can 'leave his license back'. step 2. the term 'leave his license back' is not compatible with the information in the premise. leaving something back implies returning it to a previous location. however, there is no indication in the premise that otto had his license with him at the school before the incident or that he left it there after crashing the bus. step 3. based on the information provided, the hypothesis is not logically inferable from the premise as it introduces an incorrect detail."
2117,"That drawer was an unlocked one, as he had pointed out, and he submitted that there was no evidence to prove that it was the prisoner who had concealed the poison there. ",The prisoner unlocked the draw but it wasn't him that put the poison in there.,1,0,False,"step 1: in the premise, it is stated that the drawer was unlocked and there is no evidence that the prisoner put the poison in it. this implies that the speaker is suggesting that someone else might have put the poison in the drawer. step 2: the hypothesis proposes that the prisoner unlocked the drawer but didn't place the poison there. this hypothesis does not contradict the information in the premise because it is consistent with the possibility that someone else put the poison in the unlocked drawer. step 3: based on the given information, the hypothesis is not logically inferred from the premise as there is no direct evidence linking the prisoner to the poison or ruling out other possible suspects. the hypothesis is an additional piece of information that could be true in the context of the premise but is not necessarily entailed by it."
2118,A piece suggests that Americans aren't seduced by Republican offers of a generous federal tax cut.,Americans don't feel the federal tax cut is that generous.,1,1,True,"step 1: in the premise, it is stated that americans aren't seduced by republican offers of a 'generous' federal tax cut. this implies that americans might not perceive the tax cut as particularly large or beneficial. step 2: the hypothesis, 'americans don't feel the federal tax cut is that generous', aligns with the premise as it expresses the same idea, emphasizing americans' perception of the tax cut. step 3: from this analysis, it can be concluded that the hypothesis is logically entailed by the premise, as the hypothesis follows directly from the premise's implications."
2120,"This historical novel features a "" Bildungsroman "" - of - age story, with the title taken from a poem written by Ernest Dowson.","This historical novel features a ""Bildungsroman"" or coming-of-age story, with the title taken from a poem written by Ernest Dowson.",1,1,True,"step 1: the premise states that the historical novel has a 'bildungsroman' storyline and is titled after a poem by ernest dowson. a 'bildungsroman' is a genre of literature that follows the personal growth and development of a protagonist from youth to adulthood, making it a coming-of-age story. the hypothesis also suggests the same 'bildungsroman' storyline and a connection to a poem by ernest dowson.step 2: the hypothesis is a logical consequence of the premise, as it is restating the same information but focusing on different aspects. the hypothesis is not contradictory to the premise and offers no new information that would change the understanding of the premise.step 3: based on the given information, the hypothesis can be logically inferred from the premise as they convey the same meaning."
2121,"It is the official solution, Liq. ","This is an unofficial solution, Liq.",0,0,True,"step 1: in the premise, 'it is the official solution' indicates that liq is an authorized or recognized solution to a problem or question. the hypothesis, 'this is an unofficial solution', suggests that liq is not endorsed or recognized by the relevant authorities. these statements present conflicting information. step 2: the hypothesis cannot be logically inferred from the premise because the two statements directly contradict each other. the premise asserts that liq is official, while the hypothesis asserts that it is unofficial. step 3: based on the logical contradiction between the premise and hypothesis, the hypothesis is not entailed by the premise."
2122,"She's crying, but they're not just tears of relief because you saved her baby from a polar bear.",She's crying because she is angry at what you did to her child.,0,0,True,"step 1: in the premise, it is stated that the woman is crying and her tears are not due to relief because her baby was saved from a polar bear. this suggests that the woman's emotional state is not positive, and there is an implication of distress or sadness. however, the premise does not specify the cause of her tears.step 2: the hypothesis proposes that she is crying due to anger. anger is an emotion that often involves crying, but it does not necessarily exclude other emotions like sadness or relief. in this context, the hypothesis is not directly contradictory to the premise, but it does propose a specific emotion that is not explicitly ruled out by the premise.step 3: to determine if the hypothesis is entailed by the premise, we need to consider if the hypothesis can be reasonably inferred from the information given in the premise. while the premise does not provide enough information to definitively rule out the hypothesis, it also does not provide information that directly supports it. the hypothesis introduces a new element (anger) that is not mentioned in the premise, so it cannot be logically inferred from the premise alone.step 4: based on the given information and logical principles, we cannot determine if the hypothesis is entailed by the premise or not, as the premise does not rule out the hypothesis but also does not provide sufficient evidence to support it."
2123,Government Management Reform Act of 1994 (Public Law 103-356) a This legislation expands the requirement for a fully audited financial statement under the CFO Act to 24 agencies and components of federal entities designated by the Office of Management and Budget.,The Government Management Reform Act has not been passed yet.,0,0,True,"step 1: in the premise, it is explicitly stated that the government management reform act of 1994 (public law 103-356) has been passed and that it expands the requirement for a fully audited financial statement under the cfo act to 24 specific agencies and components.step 2: the hypothesis, however, states that the government management reform act has not been passed yet. this directly contradicts the information stated in the premise.step 3: based on the logical negation of the premise's statements, the hypothesis cannot be logically inferred from the premise.step 4: common sense also contradicts the hypothesis, as the premise provides evidence that the government management reform act of 1994 has indeed been passed.therefore, the hypothesis is not entailed by the premise."
2124,Not all fat is  A paunch is more dangerous than chubby hips and thighs.,Having chubby hips and thighs is more dangerous than having a paunch.,0,0,True,"step 1: the premise states that 'not all fat is unhealthy' and that 'a paunch is more dangerous than chubby hips and thighs'. this implies that while having a paunch (excess fat in the abdominal area) is harmful, having chubby hips and thighs (excess fat in the lower body) is less dangerous. common sense and scientific research suggest that having too much fat in the body, regardless of its location, contributes to health issues. however, a paunch is specifically linked to increased risk of certain health problems, such as heart disease and diabetes, due to the way the body processes and stores fat in that area.step 2: the hypothesis suggests that having chubby hips and thighs is more dangerous than having a paunch, which contradicts the premise. the hypothesis states that chubby hips and thighs are more dangerous than a paunch, while the premise states that a paunch is more dangerous than chubby hips and thighs. therefore, the hypothesis cannot be logically inferred from the premise.step 3: based on the logical reasoning, common sense, and the contradictory nature of the hypothesis with the premise, the hypothesis is not entailed by the premise."
2125,"In Eastern Europe, exhumed bodies have been used as symbols by political parties, as anthropologist Katherine Verdery explains in her forthcoming book, The Political Lives of Dead Bodies in the Postsocialist Transformation . For instance, liberal reform parties have disinterred Communist leaders from their mausoleums while reburying pre-Communist nationalist heroes in elaborate sarcophagi.",Verdery researched political traditions in Eastern Asia..,0,0,True,"step 1: in the premise, we have the information that anthropologist katherine verdery has written a book about the use of exhumed bodies as symbols in eastern europe's political parties. the hypothesis states that verdery researched political traditions in eastern asia.step 2: there is no clear logical connection or implication from the premise to the hypothesis. the premise talks about verdery's research in eastern europe, but there is no mention or implication of her research in eastern asia.step 3: based on the given information, the hypothesis cannot be logically inferred from the premise."
2126,"Tax Systems  Management and Technical Weaknesses Must Be Overcome To Achieve Success (GAO/T-AIMD-96-75, March 26, 1996)",Tax Systems Management and Technical Weaknesses Must Stay to Achieve Success,0,0,True,"step 1. in the premise, it is stated that tax systems management and technical weaknesses must be overcome to achieve success. this implies that the presence of these weaknesses poses a challenge or obstacle to the success of tax systems. step 2. the hypothesis suggests that tax systems management and technical weaknesses must stay or remain in order to achieve success. this is a contradiction to the premise, as the premise states that these weaknesses must be overcome, not remained. step 3. based on the logical negation of the hypothesis compared to the premise, it is clear that the hypothesis is not entailed by the premise."
2127,"With the sun gone and the stars rocking into dizzy new configurations, there was no night or day, nor any way to guess the passage of time.","With the sun gone, it was dark and cold in this world.",1,1,True,"step 1: in the premise, the sun has gone, implying a lack of light and likely a drastic drop in temperature, as the sun is the primary source of heat and light for most planets or environments. this is a common-sense understanding of the world. step 2: the hypothesis suggests that it is dark and cold in this world, which is a logical conclusion from the premise, given the role of the sun in providing light and heat. step 3: based on the logical reasoning and common-sense understanding, the hypothesis can be inferred from the premise."
2128,H-2A workers are legally prohibited from remaining in the United States for more than one year.,H-2A workers are restricted this way in an effort to curb illegal immigration.,1,1,True,"step 1: in the premise, it is stated that h-2a workers are legally prohibited from staying in the united states for more than one year. this information is factual and does not contradict any logical principles. step 2: the hypothesis suggests that this restriction is in place to curb illegal immigration. there is a causal relationship implied between the restriction and the goal of reducing illegal immigration. while the premise does not explicitly state this, it is a reasonable and logical inference that restricting h-2a workers' stay in the united states could potentially help reduce illegal immigration, as it limits the length of time they can stay in the country legally. step 3: based on the logical connection between the premise and hypothesis, and the lack of contradictory facts, the hypothesis can be inferred from the premise.step 4: it's important to note that while the hypothesis can be logically inferred from the premise, it does not necessarily mean that this is the only or main reason for this specific restriction. there could be other reasons, such as labor market considerations, that may also play a role.step 5: in summary, the hypothesis that h-2a workers are restricted to curb illegal immigration can be logically inferred from the premise, but it does not exclude the possibility that other reasons might also be involved."
2129,well do you exercise regularly Judy,"Judy, are you done exercising for the day?",0,0,True,"step 1: in the premise, the verb 'exercise' indicates an action that judy performs regularly. this information does not provide any context about the current moment or the completion of her exercise routine.step 2: the hypothesis, 'judy, are you done exercising for the day?' is asking about the state of judy's exercise routine for the current day. it does not make an explicit statement about the completion or non-completion of her exercises.step 3: based on the information provided, the hypothesis cannot be logically inferred from the premise. the premise describes judy's exercise habit, while the hypothesis asks a question about the current status of her exercise routine.step 4: the hypothesis is not entailed by the premise."
2130,"Other attractions include hot springs, a market, and the forests and ski-slopes of nearby Uluda .",Along with those attractions are some of the most beautiful beaches in the world.,1,0,False,"step 1: in the premise, there is a list of attractions mentioned, which includes hot springs, a market, and forests and ski-slopes of uluda. no information is given about beaches in the premise. step 2: the hypothesis introduces the possibility of beautiful beaches existing among the mentioned attractions. while the premise does not directly state the presence of beaches, it does not contradict the hypothesis. step 3: the hypothesis, suggesting the presence of beautiful beaches among the listed attractions, is not logically inferred from the premise as the premise does not explicitly mention beaches. however, it is not a contradiction to the premise either, as the premise leaves room for the possibility of beaches being present."
2131,The contractor attributed $100 million of additional cost to first time manufacturing problems.,The contractor thought that $100 million could have gone towards refurnishing necessary machinery. ,1,0,False,"step 1: the premise states that the contractor identified $100 million in additional costs due to manufacturing problems. this implies that there were issues during the initial manufacturing process that led to these costs. step 2: the hypothesis suggests that the contractor believed $100 million could have been used for refurnishing necessary machinery instead. while there's no direct connection between the premise and hypothesis, it is a plausible assumption that the contractor might have been thinking about how the extra funds could have been allocated more effectively. step 3: although the hypothesis is not directly entailed by the premise, it is a reasonable inference based on common sense and the information provided. contractors may consider various options when faced with unexpected costs, and the hypothesis describes a plausible alternative use for the funds. therefore, the hypothesis can be seen as a possible explanation for the situation described in the premise, but not a logically necessary conclusion."
2132,The day gave them time to practice.,They had no time to practice. ,0,0,True,"step 1: in the premise, 'gave them time' implies that there was a sufficient duration for them to engage in the practice. this is the opposite of 'had no time' in the hypothesis.step 2: the hypothesis contradicts the premise, as it asserts that they had no time to practice while the premise states that they had time. contradictory statements cannot be logically inferred from each other.step 3: based on the logical negation of the premise, the hypothesis is not entailed by the premise."
2133,The questions address problems over the patient's lifetime.,Some of the questions involve cancer treatment and palliative care.,1,1,True,"step 1: in the premise, it is stated that the questions address problems over a patient's lifetime. this implies a broad scope of potential health issues. cancer is a common and significant health issue throughout a person's life, and palliative care is a crucial aspect of managing cancer and other severe conditions. step 2: given the premise, it is reasonable to infer that some questions could pertain to cancer treatment and palliative care, as these issues are known to be relevant to patients' lives. step 3: based on the logical connection between the premise and hypothesis, and the common-sense understanding of health issues throughout a person's lifetime, the hypothesis can be inferred from the premise.step 4: it is important to consider the scope of the hypothesis as well. the hypothesis does not contradict or narrow down the premise, as it is a specific instance of the broader problem scope mentioned in the premise."
2135,He shook his head.,He moved his head back and forth for several seconds. ,1,1,True,"step 1: the premise states that 'he shook his head.' this action can be described as a rapid motion of the head from side to side. step 2: the hypothesis states that 'he moved his head back and forth for several seconds.' this description aligns with the action described in the premise. shaking the head is essentially moving it back and forth. step 3: based on the logical similarity between the two descriptions, the hypothesis can be inferred from the premise."
2137," The reality is that the only way this is going to be solved is if you can prevent it from being a political football, like Al's criticism of me for voting to continue discussion on a variety of options at the same time; the administration was considering the same discussion.",The only way to solve this is for it to become a political football.,0,0,True,"step 1: in the premise, the speaker emphasizes the need to prevent the issue from becoming a political football, suggesting that such an outcome would hinder the solution process. this implies that becoming a political football is undesirable and a hindrance.step 2: contrary to the premise, the hypothesis proposes that the only way to solve the issue is for it to become a political football. this directly contradicts the premise's implication about the negative consequences of politicizing the issue.step 3: based on the logical analysis, the hypothesis cannot be inferred from the premise as it contradicts the information and implications presented.step 4: the hypothesis is not entailed by the premise, as the premise clearly states that preventing the issue from becoming a political football is necessary for a solution, while the hypothesis suggests that the issue must become a political football in order to be solved."
2138,"Road access may be difficult, with the last 8 km (5 miles) along a winding, narrow roadway where an alternating, one-way traffic system is in place.",Road access to the palace is very difficult.,1,1,True,"step 1: in the premise, it is mentioned that road access may be difficult due to a winding, narrow roadway with an alternating, one-way traffic system for the last 8 km (5 miles). this implies that the access conditions for the remaining part of the road are challenging and may significantly impact reaching the destination. the palace is located beyond this point.step 2: the hypothesis 'road access to the palace is very difficult' directly relates to the premise. given the information provided in the premise, it is a logical conclusion that the access to the palace would also be difficult because it is located beyond the described road conditions.step 3: based on the logical connection between the premise and hypothesis, and the lack of contradictory information, the hypothesis is entailed by the premise."
2139,"Unlike some of his class of '94 comrades in the House, who are principled in their bullheaded way, he never met a principle he wouldn't swap for a few more votes.",The graduating class of '94 was very large.,1,0,False,"step 1: in the premise, the text states that 'he' (a specific representative from the class of '94) is not principled and swaps principles for votes. there's no information provided about the size of the graduating class. step 2: the hypothesis, stating that the graduating class of '94 was very large, is not logically related to or directly inferred from the premise. the premise only discusses the behavior and principle-swapping tendencies of one individual from the class. step 3: based on the given information, there is no entailment from the premise to the hypothesis. the size of the graduating class is not mentioned or implied in the premise."
2140,They would eliminate senatorial holds.,They would add congressional holds.,0,0,True,"step 1: the premise refers to the elimination of senatorial holds, which are actions taken by senators to delay or block the confirmation of presidential nominees. the context does not provide any information about congressional holds, which are actions taken by members of the house of representatives to delay or block legislation. the two concepts - senatorial holds and congressional holds - are distinct and refer to different things.step 2: the hypothesis suggests the addition of congressional holds, which is the opposite of the elimination mentioned in the premise. the hypothesis cannot be logically inferred from the premise because they propose contradictory actions.step 3: based on the given information, the hypothesis cannot be inferred from the premise."
2141,"up on the tidal bulge into a storm'sbarometric low,",The storm was at its highest barometrically at the tidal bulge.,0,0,True,"step 1. the premise describes a location, 'up on the tidal bulge,' which is a feature of the ocean caused by the interaction of tides and weather patterns. a storm's 'barometric low' refers to a region of lower atmospheric pressure associated with a storm. this information provides the context, but it doesn't directly establish a logical connection between the premise and hypothesis. however, step 1 also considers commonsense understanding and factual consistency, which can be important in natural language reasoning. in this case, it's reasonable to assume that a storm's lowest pressure area could potentially be located at the tidal bulge. this is because tidal bulges can affect weather patterns, including the development and movement of storms. step 2. the hypothesis suggests that 'the storm was at its highest barometrically at the tidal bulge.' this statement contradicts the premise, as the premise does not indicate that the storm had its highest pressure at the tidal bulge but rather that it was at a low pressure there. step 3. based on the information provided, the hypothesis cannot be logically inferred from the premise. in fact, the hypothesis contradicts the premise."
2142,Those listed with a quadruple asterisk (****) have won the Tony Award for Best Actor or Best Actress in a Musical or Play.,Those listed with a quadruple asterisk * * * * have won the Tony Award for Best Actor.,1,1,True,"step 1. in the premise, the asterisk (****) is used to denote individuals who have won a tony award for best actor or best actress in a musical or play. step 2. the hypothesis states that those listed with a quadruple asterisk have won the tony award for best actor, which is consistent with the information in the premise since best actor is a subcategory of best actor or best actress. step 3. since the hypothesis is a specific case of the premise, it can be logically inferred from the premise."
2143,i bet that's true,I think it may be false,0,0,True,"step 1: in the premise, the speaker expresses a belief that something is true using the first person perspective 'i bet that's true'. in the hypothesis, another first person perspective 'i think it may be false' is used to express a different belief. both statements represent subjective opinions rather than statements of fact.step 2: the hypothesis does not logically follow from the premise. the fact that one person believes something to be true does not necessarily entail that another person believes it to be false.step 3: based on the given information, there is no logical entailment relationship between the premise and hypothesis."
2144,Time agrees and seeks an exit strategy to end the mess.,Time magazine disagrees.,0,0,True,"step 1: the premise is about time, referring to it as an abstract concept that agrees and seeks an exit strategy. this does not provide sufficient information to determine if time the magazine agrees or disagrees with something. the concept of time cannot hold opinions or strategies.step 2: the hypothesis directly contradicts the premise by suggesting that time magazine disagrees, instead of agreeing and seeking an exit strategy as stated in the premise.step 3: given that the premise does not provide enough information to determine the agreement or disagreement of time magazine, and the hypothesis contradicts the premise, the hypothesis cannot be logically inferred from the premise.step 4: the hypothesis is not entailed by the premise, as they convey different meanings."
2145,"In this respect, it's striking that in the press release announcing the latest turmoil, Dunlap said, I want to stress that getting the right cost structure is only the first step in the process of building a powerful global business.","He wants to stress that getting the right cost structure is not the first step, in fact it isn't a step.",0,0,True,"step 1: in the premise, dunlap acknowledges that 'getting the right cost structure' is only the first step in building a powerful global business. this implies that there are other steps involved in the process as well. step 2: the hypothesis, however, suggests that 'getting the right cost structure' is not a step at all. this directly contradicts the premise, as the premise clearly states that it is a step. step 3: based on the logical negation of the premise in the hypothesis, it is clear that the hypothesis cannot be logically inferred from the premise."
2146,A goalie braces himself for the ball that's coming his way.,A baseball player swinging at a pitch.,0,0,True,"step 1: in the premise, a goalie is preparing for a ball. this implies the presence of a ball being in motion towards the goalie. however, the premise does not specify the type of ball or the context of the situation. the hypothesis describes a baseball player swinging at a pitch, which implies the presence of a baseball. step 2: the hypothesis does not logically follow from the premise because a goalie and a baseball player are two distinct roles with different contexts and actions. a goalie is a type of sports player who defends a goal in various team sports, such as soccer or hockey. swinging a bat to hit a ball is an action specific to baseball players. step 3: based on the given information, the hypothesis cannot be inferred from the premise as there is no logical connection or common sense reasoning that can establish this relationship."
2147,so you haven't been tempted uh to to call any of these nine hundred numbers trying to get a credit card then,"You know I don't care about whether or not you called those numbers, right?",0,0,True,"step 1: in the premise, the speaker is asking if the interlocutor (you) have been tempted to call 'these nine hundred numbers' to get a credit card. the premise does not provide any information about the interlocutor's actions or whether they actually called the numbers or not. it only shows that the speaker is inquiring about the interlocutor's potential interest in calling these numbers.step 2: in the hypothesis, the speaker is stating that they don't care about whether or not the interlocutor called those numbers. the hypothesis does not logically follow from the premise because the premise does not provide sufficient information to infer that the interlocutor actually called the numbers.step 3: based on the information provided in the premise, the hypothesis is not entailed. the premise only indicates that the speaker is inquiring about the interlocutor's potential interest or actions, whereas the hypothesis makes a statement about the speaker's indifference to the interlocutor's actions."
2148,A young dark-haired woman crouches on the banks of a river while washing dishes.,A man cuts his hair.,0,0,True,"step 1: in the premise, a young dark-haired woman is performing the action of washing dishes next to a river. there is no mention of any other individuals or their actions. step 2: the hypothesis states that a man is cutting his hair. this action is unrelated to the scene described in the premise. step 3: based on the given information, the hypothesis cannot be logically inferred from the premise as there is no connection between the two sentences."
2149,"The second thing I learned is the importance of collaboration among judges, bar associations, private attorneys and civil legal service providers.",Those who work in law must retain a largely antagonistic relationship with others who work in law.,0,0,True,"step 1: in the premise, the importance of collaboration among judges, bar associations, private attorneys, and civil legal service providers is emphasized. this implies a cooperative and interdependent relationship among these entities in the legal field. step 2: the hypothesis suggests a largely antagonistic relationship, which contradicts the premise as it implies a hostile or opposing relationship. step 3: based on the information in the premise, the hypothesis cannot be logically inferred and is, in fact, contradictory."
2150,Soon small huts and tents dotted the landscape.,"The landscape would soon be filled with huts, tents and people",1,1,True,"step 1: in the premise, 'small huts and tents' are mentioned, indicating temporary shelters. the landscape being dotted with these structures suggests that there will be an increase in habitation. the presence of huts and tents implies the presence of people as they are typically used for shelter by individuals or families. step 2: the hypothesis 'the landscape would soon be filled with huts, tents and people' can be logically inferred from the premise. the premise sets the scene for an increase in habitation, and the hypothesis extends this by explicitly stating the presence of people. step 3: based on the logical connection between the premise and hypothesis, the hypothesis can be inferred from the premise."
2151,a bride and a groom at their wedding kissing,A newly married couple kiss.,1,1,True,"step 1: in the premise, we have two individuals identified as a bride and a groom engaging in the act of kissing. this indicates that they have recently gotten married. step 2: the hypothesis describes a newly married couple kissing, which is identical to the situation described in the premise. the hypothesis is a special case or instance of the premise. step 3: given the identity of the individuals and the action described in both the premise and hypothesis, it follows logically that the hypothesis can be inferred from the premise."
2152,"In the Victorian era, the town expanded northward from its original site (a Roman settlement at Waterhead); the commercial center now lies approximately 1 km (1.2 mile) from the lake.",There was no Roman settlement in the area in the Victorian era.,0,0,True,"step 1: in the premise, it is mentioned that there was a roman settlement at waterhead during the original site of the town. the victorian era expansion occurred approximately 1 km (1.2 miles) from this site. step 2: the hypothesis suggests that there was no roman settlement in the area during the victorian era. the premise and hypothesis are contradictory, as the premise states that there was indeed a roman settlement at waterhead during the victorian era era's early stages. step 3: based on the logical contradiction between the premise and hypothesis, the hypothesis is not entailed by the premise."
2153,now that's a good idea,That's a really bad idea.,0,0,True,"step 1: in the premise, 'now that's a good idea' signifies approval or agreement with a suggested idea. the hypothesis, 'that's a really bad idea', signifies the opposite, disapproval or rejection of the idea.step 2: a good idea and a bad idea cannot be logically inferred from each other. the premise and hypothesis represent contradictory viewpoints.step 3: based on the logical principles of non-contradiction and the given information, the hypothesis is not entailed by the premise."
2154,Paper goods.,Metal goods.,0,0,True,"step 1: paper goods refer to items made of paper, such as stationery, paper plates, and paper bags. metal goods, on the other hand, are items made of metal, like tools, utensils, and appliances. there is no commonality or logical connection between paper and metal as materials or goods. the premise mentions nothing about metal goods.step 2: the hypothesis, 'metal goods', cannot be logically inferred from the premise, 'paper goods'. the hypothesis introduces a new concept, metal, which is not related to the original concept, paper.step 3: based on the logical analysis, the hypothesis, 'metal goods', is not entailed by the premise, 'paper goods'."
2156,You realize that he chose the one place in the house to hide it where its presence would not be remarked? ,He wanted the item to be found. ,0,0,True,"step 1: the premise suggests that the person went to great lengths to hide an item in a place where its presence would not be noticed. this implies an intention to conceal the item. step 2: the hypothesis, however, states that the person wanted the item to be found. this is a contradictory statement as wanting an item to be found is the opposite of hiding it. step 3: based on the logical inconsistency between the premise and hypothesis, no, the hypothesis cannot be inferred from the premise."
2158,oh you know i like what i'm doing right now,What I'm doing now is torturous.,0,0,True,"step 1: in the premise, the speaker expresses a liking or enjoyment for what they are currently doing. this statement does not provide any specific information about the nature or context of the action. the hypothesis, on the other hand, asserts that the current action is torturous or extremely unpleasant. step 2: a person expressing enjoyment for an action does not logically imply that the same action is torturous. in fact, these statements contradict each other. therefore, the hypothesis cannot be logically inferred from the premise. step 3: based on the logical analysis, the hypothesis is not entailed by the premise."
2159,Walk right in.,Do not hesitate to get in.,1,1,True,"step 1: in the premise, 'walk right in' is an imperative phrase meaning to enter a place without delay or hesitation. it suggests a direct and confident action. step 2: the hypothesis, 'do not hesitate to get in', is a negated imperative meaning the same thing as the premise but with a negative form. it also suggests a direct and confident action, which is similar to the meaning of the premise. step 3: given the identical meanings and the logical equivalence between the premise and hypothesis, they are logically equivalent. therefore, the hypothesis can be inferred from the premise. step 4: it is important to note that logical equivalence does not necessarily mean that every premise implies every hypothesis, but in this case, they are identical in meaning."
2160,"The palace was almost totally destroyed in the air raids of World War II, then rebuilt in ferroconcrete.",The palace was totally destroyed in World War II and has never been rebuilt.,0,0,True,"step 1: in the premise, it is stated that the palace was almost totally destroyed during the air raids of world war ii, but it was later rebuilt in ferroconcrete. this implies that there was significant damage inflicted on the palace during the war, but it was not completely destroyed since it was later rebuilt. step 2: the hypothesis suggests that the palace was totally destroyed during the war and has never been rebuilt. this contradicts the information from the premise that the palace was rebuilt. step 3: based on the logical analysis, the hypothesis cannot be inferred from the premise as it contradicts the given information."
2161,i think the rate of processing is just about uh reached the rate of housing anyway so keep the keep the normal as it is can't upset the system very much,The rate of processing is way higher than the rate of housing to upset the system.,0,0,True,"step 1. the premise expresses a speaker's opinion that the current rate of processing is nearly equal to the rate of housing, and it is important not to upset the system. step 2. the hypothesis states that the rate of processing is significantly higher than the rate of housing, which contradicts the information in the premise. in order for the hypothesis to be logically inferred from the premise, the premise would need to indicate that the current rate of processing can handle being higher than the rate of housing without upsetting the system. however, there is no such indication in the premise. step 3. based on the given information, the hypothesis is not logically inferable from the premise."
2162,That would do for a little extra cover- it was almost my size.,The tree was tiny.,0,1,False,"step 1. the speaker in the premise is commenting that the tree provides sufficient cover and is almost the same size as something else. this implies that the tree is not overly large. common sense suggests that a tiny tree would be small enough to be almost the same size as something else. no contradictory information is given.step 2. the hypothesis 'the tree was tiny' is logically consistent with and can be inferred from the premise. the tree being tiny would explain why it is almost the same size as something else.step 3. based on the logical reasoning and common sense, the hypothesis 'the tree was tiny' can be inferred from the premise."
2163,"Women, you will notice, bathe in full sari.",You'll notice the women bathing fully dressed to stay warm.,1,0,False,"step 1: in the premise, it is stated that women bathe in full saris. a sari is a traditional indian garment that covers the entire body, leaving the midriff and head exposed. it is not explicitly stated why women bathe in this attire. step 2: the hypothesis suggests an alternate reason for why women bathe in full saris - to stay warm. this reason does not contradict the information in the premise, but it is an addition to it. it is a plausible explanation as bathing in a full sari could provide extra insulation, especially in colder climates. step 3: while the hypothesis cannot be logically inferred directly from the premise, as it introduces a new reason not explicitly stated in the premise, it does not contradict it and is a reasonable assumption based on common sense and possible cultural context. step 4: however, without more context or specific information, it is impossible to definitively say if all instances of women bathing in saris are for the purpose of staying warm or if there are other reasons as well. therefore, we cannot label this as entailment but rather a plausible assumption."
2164,"In 1889, two million visitors paid 5 francs a head to climb to the top and it has bewitched the world ever since.","Two million visitors went there in 1889., up 30% from the year before.",1,0,False,"step 1. in the premise, we have a statement about the number of visitors and the admission fee in the year 1889. no specific information is given about the number of visitors from the previous year. step 2. the hypothesis suggests an increase of 30% from the number of visitors in the year before 1889. however, the premise does not provide enough information to infer the number of visitors in the year before 1889, nor does it indicate any percentage change. step 3. based on the given information, the hypothesis cannot be logically inferred from the premise."
2166,other agencies providing legal help and basic,There are many other agencies that provide legal help.,1,1,True,"step 1: in the premise, 'other agencies' are mentioned as providing 'legal help'. this implies the existence and role of multiple organizations offering legal assistance. step 2: the hypothesis 'there are many other agencies that provide legal help' is a statement that affirms the existence and quantity of the 'other agencies' mentioned in the premise. the hypothesis is logically equivalent to the information provided in the premise. step 3: based on the logical equivalence, common sense, and lack of contradictory information, the hypothesis is entailed by the premise."
2167,"Sports Illustrated , by far the best-written sports print magazine, is more disappointing online.",The online Sports Illustrated is better than the print version.,0,0,True,"step 1: in the premise, the statement 'sports illustrated, by far the best-written sports print magazine' indicates that the print version of sports illustrated is considered to have high-quality writing. the statement 'is more disappointing online' implies that the online version does not meet or live up to the expectations set by the print version.step 2: the hypothesis 'the online sports illustrated is better than the print version' directly contradicts the premise as it suggests the opposite of what is stated. common sense and logical reasoning do not support this conclusion, as the premise explicitly states that the print version is superior.step 3: based on the given information, the hypothesis 'the online sports illustrated is better than the print version' cannot be inferred from the premise.step 4: the hypothesis contradicts the premise, making it a clear case of no entailment."
2168,um-hum yeah yeah i usually um you know i get Usenet so i usually just uh look at the recipe groups in there uh for interesting things,Online groups are interesting sources of new recipes.,1,1,True,"step 1: in the premise, the speaker mentions their personal habit of using usenet groups to find interesting recipes. this implies that they find value in these online groups for this specific purpose. step 2: the hypothesis states that online groups are interesting sources of new recipes. this statement is logically equivalent to the content the speaker finds in the recipe groups being 'new' and 'interesting'. since the speaker finds new and interesting recipes in usenet groups, the hypothesis is a logical consequence of the premise. step 3: based on the logical connection between the premise and hypothesis, and the lack of contradictory information, the hypothesis can be inferred from the premise."
2169,"Although all four categories of emissions are down substantially, they only achieve 50-75% of the proposed cap by 2007 (shown as the dotted horizontal line in each of the above figures).",All of the emission categories experienced a downturn except for one.,0,0,True,"step 1: in the premise, it is stated that all four categories of emissions have decreased substantially but have not yet reached the proposed cap by 2007. this implies that there is still a gap between the current emissions and the proposed cap for each category. step 2: the hypothesis proposes that all but one category of emissions experienced a downturn. this hypothesis does not directly contradict the premise, as it is still possible for one category to have an increase while the others are decreasing, and the total emissions still fall short of the proposed cap. however, based on the given information, it's not possible to determine if the hypothesis is true or false without more context. step 3: the hypothesis is not entailed by the premise, as the premise does not provide sufficient information to infer that only three out of the four categories have experienced a downturn."
2170,he'll come in mama i think the ghost is in the house mama i hear it,"It's all right ma, the ghost left us.",0,0,True,"step 1. the premise describes a situation where a person (likely a child) expresses their belief that they hear a ghost in the house. this belief is based on their perception of unusual sounds. step 2. the hypothesis, on the other hand, asserts that the ghost has left the house. there are no direct logical connections between the premise and hypothesis based on the given information. common sense suggests that the person's belief in the presence of a ghost does not directly infer the absence of the ghost. step 3. the hypothesis cannot be logically inferred from the premise as there is no sufficient evidence provided in the premise to support the hypothesis."
2171,The monetary wealth and vast tracts of land owned by the monasteries were redistributed according to Henry's favor.,The monasteries were able to keep their vast amounts of land and the wealth they had created for themselves.,0,0,True,"step 1: in the premise, henry is responsible for redistributing the monetary wealth and lands owned by the monasteries according to his favor. this implies that the monasteries did not keep all their wealth and lands for themselves. however, the premise does not explicitly state that the monasteries lost all their wealth and lands. it only states that some of it was redistributed. step 2: the hypothesis suggests that the monasteries were able to keep their vast amounts of land and the wealth they had created for themselves. this is not directly contradictory to the premise, as the premise does not state that all of the monasteries' wealth and lands were taken away. however, it is not explicitly stated in the premise that the monasteries kept any of their wealth or lands. step 3: to determine if the hypothesis can be logically inferred from the premise, we need to consider the meaning of 'able to keep' in the hypothesis. 'able to keep' suggests that the monasteries had some degree of control over their wealth and lands despite henry's redistribution. this is not necessarily contradictory to the premise, as it is possible that the monasteries were able to keep some of their wealth and lands while still having some redistributed. therefore, based on the information provided, it is not clear that the hypothesis can be logically inferred from the premise. however, without additional context or information, it is also not possible to definitively say that the hypothesis is false. thus, the label is 0 for no entailment."
2172,"Clients could rarely, if ever, earn a positive net interest.",Clients often earned a positive net interest.,0,0,True,"step 1: the premise states that clients rarely or never earned a positive net interest. this implies a general condition where the interest earned by clients is less than the interest paid out. step 2: the hypothesis suggests a contrasting condition where clients often earned a positive net interest, meaning the interest earned by clients was more than the interest paid out. these two conditions contradict each other as they cannot both be true based on the information given in the premise. step 3: since the hypothesis contradicts the premise, it cannot be logically inferred from it."
2173,The rumble of the horses rode into the darkness of night.,The horses rode into the dark night to escape from battle.,1,0,False,"step 1: in the premise, 'the horses rode into the darkness of night', the key information is the horses moving into the night. this movement could be for various reasons, including escaping from battle. the night setting is neutral and can be explained by different scenarios. common sense and logical principles do not directly contradict the hypothesis.step 2: the hypothesis 'the horses rode into the dark night to escape from battle' is not logically inferred from the premise. while the premise does not exclude the possibility of the horses escaping from battle, it does not provide sufficient evidence to infer that they were indeed doing so.step 3: based on the given information, the hypothesis cannot be logically inferred from the premise. the premise describes the horses moving into the night, but it does not specify the reason for their movement. the hypothesis adds an additional detail - escaping from battle - which is not present in the premise."
2174,so anyway i think our society is just worse off than i realized that's what i thought,I thought we were doing a lot better but then I read an article that said that we're not.,1,1,True,"step 1: in the premise, the speaker expresses their personal belief that they had previously underestimated the state of society. no specific information about the reasons for this belief or the nature of society is provided. in the hypothesis, the speaker also expresses a change in their belief, this time indicating that they had previously overestimated the current state of affairs.step 2: the hypothesis can be logically inferred from the premise because both statements express a change in the speaker's belief about society's condition. the hypothesis does not contradict the premise but rather presents a contrasting view that might have arisen from the same or similar evidence.step 3: based on the given information, it is not possible to definitively determine if the premise and hypothesis are factually true or false. however, from a logical perspective, the hypothesis is a reasonable inference from the premise because both statements concern the speaker's changing perception of society.the focus of this analysis is on whether the hypothesis is logically entailed by the premise, not on the truth or falsity of their contents."
2175,"Sainte-Anne itself has a long, broad beach used not only by fishermen in vividly painted boats, but also by families with small children.",Only fishermen and their boats can be seen lining the beaches of Sainte-Anne.,0,0,True,"step 1. in the premise, we have information about the type of people using the beach at sainte-anne - fishermen and families with small children. the description of 'vividly painted boats' further emphasizes the presence of fishermen. step 2. the hypothesis suggests that only fishermen and their boats are present at the beach. while the hypothesis is consistent with the information in the premise, it is not an exact entailment. the families with small children are not mentioned in the hypothesis. step 3. based on the given information, the hypothesis cannot be logically inferred from the premise as it is not an exact entailment."
2176,"Although some government agencies hire individuals with the title "" Criminologist, "" nominally a criminologist has a Ph.D. in Criminal Justice.","Although some government agencies hire individuals with the title ""Criminologist,"" nominally a criminologist has a Ph.D. in Criminology or Criminal Justice.",1,1,True,"step 1: in the premise, it is stated that some government agencies hire individuals with the title 'criminologist,' and it is clarified that a criminologist, in this context, holds a ph.d. in criminal justice. this implies that having a ph.d. in criminal justice is a requirement or an essential characteristic for being called a criminologist in this context.step 2: the hypothesis states that a criminologist has a ph.d. in criminology or criminal justice. this is equivalent to the premise, as 'criminology' is a subfield of 'criminal justice.' thus, the hypothesis can be logically inferred from the premise.step 3: based on the logical equivalence between 'criminal justice' and 'criminology' as fields of study for a ph.d., the hypothesis is a logical entailment of the premise."
2177,8. Are there significant policy issues that must be resolved to make interventions for alcohol problems more feasible?,There are a lot of policy issues that must be fixed to make it easier to intervene in drug problems.,0,1,False,"step 1: in the premise, the existence and significance of policy issues related to alcohol problems are stated. step 2: the hypothesis suggests that there are policy issues related to drug problems that need to be addressed in order to make interventions easier. while the premise and hypothesis are not identical, they do share a common theme - policy issues hindering interventions. step 3: given the close relationship between policy issues regarding alcohol and drug problems, it is reasonable to infer that addressing the policy issues mentioned in the hypothesis would also help make interventions for alcohol problems more feasible. therefore, the hypothesis can be inferred from the premise, although not directly, as they are not identical.step 4: it is important to note that the hypothesis goes beyond the scope of the premise by mentioning 'drug problems' instead of 'alcohol problems'. however, this difference does not negate the entailment, as the resolution of policy issues for drug problems would logically lead to easier interventions for alcohol problems, given their similarities.step 5: in summary, the hypothesis can be inferred from the premise as it logically follows from the premise's content, with a reasonable degree of extension to include drug problems in addition to alcohol problems."
2178,The second step-initial testing-can be done by applying logical tests to electronic data files or hard copy reports.,Testers generally prefer electronic data over the hard copy reports.,1,0,False,"step 1: in the premise, it is stated that the second step-initial testing-can be done with logical tests on both electronic data files and hard copy reports. this implies that both forms of data are used and valid for testing. step 2: the hypothesis suggests a preference of testers towards electronic data over hard copy reports, but it does not contradict the premise as it doesn't state that they exclusively use electronic data or that hard copy reports are no longer used. it is common sense that people, including testers, may have preferences for certain tools or methods, even if multiple options are available. step 3: while the premise and hypothesis do not directly entail each other, the hypothesis does not contradict the premise and could potentially be true in the context described. the final conclusion is that the hypothesis is not logically entailed by the premise, but it is not a contradiction either."
2179,Among runners-up is Boston solo Eleanor Newhoff.,Eleanor Newhoff had trained hard for the Olympic triathlon. ,1,0,False,"step 1: in the premise, 'among runners-ups' refers to individuals who came in second place. 'boston solo eleanor newhoff' indicates that eleanor newhoff was one of those individuals. this information does not directly relate to her training for the olympic triathlon. common sense suggests that individuals who compete in races, especially those who come in second place, would typically train hard to achieve their best performance. however, there's no explicit statement in the premise that confirms or denies eleanor newhoff's training. step 2: the hypothesis 'eleanor newhoff had trained hard for the olympic triathlon' cannot be logically inferred from the premise 'among runners-ups is boston solo eleanor newhoff' alone, as there's no direct evidence or logical connection between the two statements. step 3: based on the information given, it's impossible to determine with certainty if the hypothesis 'eleanor newhoff had trained hard for the olympic triathlon' is entailed by the premise 'among runners-ups is boston solo eleanor newhoff'."
2180,"Time 's cover package attacks corporate  In some ways, it represents pork-barrel legislation of the worst order.",Time writes about pork-barrel legislation that harms small towns.,1,1,True,"step 1: the premise describes time's cover package criticizing pork-barrel legislation, which is a type of government spending that often benefits specific interest groups at the expense of the general population. this spending is often seen as wasteful and inefficient. step 2: the hypothesis suggests that time writes about pork-barrel legislation that harms small towns. this is a specific instance of pork-barrel legislation, as it implies spending that benefits certain areas to the detriment of others. the hypothesis is related to the premise as they both involve pork-barrel legislation. step 3: given that the premise discusses time's criticism of pork-barrel legislation and the hypothesis describes a specific instance of such legislation, it can be reasonably inferred that the hypothesis is entailed by the premise.step 4: in conclusion, the hypothesis 'time writes about pork-barrel legislation that harms small towns' is a logical implication of the premise 'time's cover package attacks corporate pork-barrel legislation of the worst order'."
2181,Jerusalem is the undisputed star attraction of Israel.,Jerusalem sees hundreds of thousands of visitors daily. ,1,1,True,"step 1: in the premise, jerusalem is described as the 'undisputed star attraction' of israel. this implies that jerusalem is a significant and popular destination for tourists. step 2: the hypothesis suggests that jerusalem sees hundreds of thousands of visitors daily. this is a reasonable inference from the premise, as it is common sense that a major tourist attraction would have a large number of visitors. step 3: based on the logical connection between a major tourist attraction and large crowds of visitors, and the lack of contradictory information in the premise or hypothesis, the hypothesis can be inferred from the premise."
2182,"And so the cult of Napoleon was, finally, a cult of the tomb.",All members of the cult were loyal to Napoleon.,1,0,False,"step 1: in the premise, it is stated that the 'cult of napoleon was, finally, a cult of the tomb'. this implies that the focus of the cult's devotion shifted towards napoleon's tomb. however, it does not necessarily mean that the members were not loyal to napoleon while he was alive or that their loyalty ended with his death. it is a common belief that people can be deeply devoted to a historical figure or symbol, even if they cannot physically interact with that person. step 2: the hypothesis, 'all members of the cult were loyal to napoleon', does not directly contradict the premise. it is possible for a cult to be both devoted to a tomb and to its historical figure. step 3: while the premise does not explicitly state or deny the loyalty of the cult members to napoleon, it is reasonable to assume that the loyalty of the cult members to napoleon could have been a contributing factor to the cult's development into a cult of the tomb. thus, the hypothesis is not logically inferred from the premise, but it is not contradictory either. the premise and hypothesis can coexist, as the loyalty of the cult members to napoleon is a plausible explanation for the cult's focus on the tomb.step 4: it is important to note that the premise and hypothesis describe different aspects of the cult's behavior. the premise describes the cult's focus or devotion, while the hypothesis describes the loyalty of the cult members to napoleon. these two statements are related but distinct, and it is possible for both to be true at the same time.therefore, based on the given information, the hypothesis 'all members of the cult were loyal to napoleon' is not logically inferred from the premise, but it is not contradictory either.label: 0"
2183,Phentermine is a relative of amphetamine that reduces hunger and increases metabolism.,"Phentermine is a highly illegal, deadly drug, that increases hunger.",0,0,True,"step 1. in the premise, we have the information that phentermine is a relative of amphetamine, reduces hunger, and increases metabolism. this means it is a prescription medication used for weight loss, acting on the nervous system to suppress appetite. commonsense understanding and factual consistency support this interpretation. step 2. the hypothesis states that phentermine is a highly illegal, deadly drug that increases hunger, which is a direct contradiction of the premise's information. the hypothesis is not logically related to the premise. step 3. based on the logical reasoning, the hypothesis is not entailed by the premise."
2184,"The lovely Bianca has several admirers in the play, but Baptista has refused to allow her to marry until his shrewish daughter Kate has found a husband.","The lovely Ignacik has several admirers in the play, but Baptista has refused to allow her to marry until his shrewish daughter Kate has found a husband.",0,1,False,"step 1: in the premise, bianca is described as a lovely woman with several admirers in the play. baptista, her father, has refused to allow her to marry until his other daughter, kate, has found a husband. this indicates a situation where bianca's marriage is delayed due to a condition concerning kate.step 2: the hypothesis describes ignacik as a lovely woman with several admirers in the play, and her marriage being delayed due to a condition concerning kate. this is similar to the situation described in the premise, with the exception of the names of the individuals involved.step 3: although the hypothesis involves different names, the logical relationship between the events described in the premise and hypothesis is the same. since the hypothesis is a logical transformation of the premise with different names, it can be inferred from the premise.step 4: common sense and logical principles do not contradict this conclusion. the hypothesis follows naturally from the premise by substituting ignacik for bianca.step 5: based on the logical reasoning, the lack of contradictory facts, and the similarity between the premise and hypothesis, the hypothesis is entailed by the premise."
2185,"To supplement our ongoing audit work at federal agencies and gain a broader understanding of how information security programs can be successfully implemented, we studied the management practices of eight nonfederal",We felt that the implementation of information security programs in a federal context deserved more research.,1,1,True,"step 1: in the premise, the context is set as studying management practices of eight nonfederal organizations for the purpose of supplementing ongoing audit work at federal agencies and gaining a better understanding of how information security programs can be effectively implemented in a federal context.step 2: the hypothesis, stating 'we felt that the implementation of information security programs in a federal context deserved more research', is consistent with the premise as it also expresses a desire for further investigation into information security programs in a federal context.step 3: based on the logical relationship between the premise and hypothesis, and the absence of contradictory information, the hypothesis can be inferred from the premise as it represents an extension or elaboration of the actions described in the premise."
2186,"Conspiracy theorists  MasterCard is investing in a chip that can store electronic cash, your medical history, and keys to your home and office.",No one thinks Mastercard is up to anything nefarious.,0,0,True,"step 1: in the premise, it is stated that conspiracy theorists believe mastercard is investing in a chip that can store electronic cash, medical history, and keys. this implies that there are concerns about the potential misuse or privacy invasion associated with this technology. step 2: the hypothesis suggests that no one thinks mastercard is up to anything nefarious, which directly contradicts the premise. this contradiction indicates that the hypothesis cannot be logically inferred from the premise. step 3: based on the logical contradiction between the premise and hypothesis, the hypothesis is not entailed by the premise."
2187,"At the top of the escalator, the phat lady made a sharp left into a silky hedge of Liz Claiborne blouses to confer with a salesclerk.",The phat lady is asking a salesclerk about the latest trends.,1,1,True,"step 1: in the premise, the phat lady is identified as making a sharp left into a section of liz claiborne blouses to confer with a salesclerk at the top of an escalator. this scenario implies that the phat lady is likely seeking information or advice about the liz claiborne blouses, possibly inquiring about the latest trends. step 2: the hypothesis also suggests that the phat lady is asking a salesclerk about something - in this case, about trends. given the context of the premise, the hypothesis is a reasonable and logical extension of the information provided. step 3: based on the logical connection between the premise and hypothesis, common sense understanding of shopping behavior, and the lack of contradictory information, the hypothesis can be inferred from the premise."
2188,"He appropriated for the State much of the personal fortunes of the princes, but found it harder to curtail the power of land-owners who had extensive contacts with the more conservative elements in his Congress Party.","It was difficult to curtail the power of land-owners in extensive contact with the more conservative elements in the Congress Party, because the Party was paying them off.",1,0,False,"step 1: the premise describes the historical situation where a person, likely a political leader, confiscated wealth from the princes but struggled to limit the influence of landowners with connections to the more conservative faction within his congress party. the premise does not provide any information about the nature of these payments or transactions between the landowners and the congress party.step 2: the hypothesis suggests a reason for the difficulty in curtailing the power of these landowners. it proposes that the congress party was paying them off as an explanation. however, the premise does not explicitly state or imply that such payments were taking place.step 3: while the hypothesis might be plausible or even likely in certain contexts, it cannot be logically inferred from the premise alone. the premise does not provide enough information to deduce the existence of such payments.step 4: without sufficient evidence or logical connection, the hypothesis cannot be considered a valid entailment of the premise. there might be situations where the power of landowners could be attributed to other factors, such as their political influence or alliances.therefore, the hypothesis is not entailed by the premise."
2189,"I only say that it would explain many things such as why Kitchell has not been caught."" ",He had not been captured because he was an escape artist.,1,1,True,"step 1: in the premise, the speaker states that kitchell's unexplained absence and failure to be caught could be explained by various reasons, including him being an 'escape artist'. this implies that there is some evidence or suspicion suggesting that kitchell has the ability to evade capture.step 2: the hypothesis proposes that kitchell's ability to not be caught is due to him being an 'escape artist'. this explanation is consistent with the premise, as it offers a potential solution to the question of why kitchell hasn't been caught. the hypothesis does not contradict any information presented in the premise.step 3: based on the given context, the hypothesis can be reasonably inferred from the premise, as it offers a plausible explanation for the observed phenomenon."
2190,"The effects on personal consumption show a decline of between $13 billion and $31, or 0.1% to 0.3%, depending on the scenario.",The decline is expected to continue. ,1,1,True,"step 1: in the premise, we have an estimate of a decline in personal consumption, with a range given by two different scenarios. the decline is quantified in dollars and percentage. step 2: the hypothesis states that the decline is expected to continue. this implies that no change or reversal of the downward trend in personal consumption is anticipated. step 3: given the information in the premise, there is no contradiction with the hypothesis. the premise describes the decline and the hypothesis infers that it will persist. step 4: while the premise does not explicitly state that the decline is a one-time event, the information provided does not indicate an expectation for an increase or recovery. the hypothesis, therefore, is a reasonable inference based on the premise and common sense understanding of economic trends. step 5: the hypothesis is a logical inference from the premise, as it does not contradict the given information and is a continuation of the trend described in the premise."
2191,To Be to Be is a 1983 American war comedy film directed by Alan Johnson and produced by Mel Brooks.,To Be or Not to Be is a 1983 American war comedy film directed by Alan Johnson and produced by Mel Brooks.,1,1,True,"step 1: the premise and hypothesis both provide the title, genre, year, type (film), director, and producer of the same movie. no contradictory information is presented. step 2: the hypothesis is a slight variation of the premise, with the word 'or' instead of 'to be'. however, the meaning is the same, as both sentences refer to the same movie. step 3: given the identical information in both the premise and hypothesis, and the minor difference in wording not affecting the meaning, the hypothesis can be inferred from the premise."
2192,oh i see well i worked for the government so i i moved uh,"I have never even had a job, let alone worked for the government as a spy. ",0,0,True,"step 1: in the premise, the speaker mentions that they have worked for the government. this statement provides factual information about the speaker's past employment history. in the hypothesis, the speaker denies ever having had a job, let alone working for the government. step 2: the hypothesis contradicts the premise, as it asserts that the speaker has never had a job, whereas the premise states that they have. the denial of having a job at any point in their life makes it impossible for them to have worked for the government, as stated in the premise. step 3: based on the logical contradiction between the premise and hypothesis, the hypothesis is not entailed by the premise."
2193,well i hear my kids are needing me again so i'll go see what they need  and we'll maybe talk to you again,My kids are independent and do not need me at all.,0,0,True,"step 1: in the premise, the speaker mentions that they are going to see their kids because they need help and possibly talk to someone again. this implies that the kids are currently in a situation where they require the speaker's assistance or presence. step 2: the hypothesis states that the kids do not need the speaker at all and are independent. this directly contradicts the information in the premise. step 3: based on the information provided, the hypothesis cannot be inferred from the premise as it goes against the logical connections and facts presented.step 4: common sense also suggests that the hypothesis cannot be inferred from the premise, as the premise mentions the kids needing help, which is inconsistent with the hypothesis that they do not need the speaker at all.therefore, the label is: 0"
2194,A 12-inch golden-dragon magnolia.,She gave him a twelve inch magnolia. ,1,0,False,"step 1: in the premise, a '12-inch golden-dragon magnolia' is described. this information doesn't directly involve any actions or agents, it is just a description of an object.step 2: the hypothesis introduces an agent 'she' and an action 'gave'. however, there is no clear connection between the premise and hypothesis based on the provided information. a '12-inch golden-dragon magnolia' could have been given to someone, but there's no evidence in the premise that such an event occurred.step 3: based on the given information, the hypothesis 'she gave him a twelve inch magnolia' cannot be logically inferred from the premise 'a 12-inch golden-dragon magnolia'."
2195,"A young woman in a green ""Aeropostale"" shirt and a green bracelet with a black purse, looking down with pursed lips.",The shirt is white.,0,0,True,"step 1: analyze the given premise and identify the key information. the premise describes a young woman with a green aeropostale shirt, a green bracelet, and a black purse. the woman is also described as looking down with pursed lips. step 2: the hypothesis, 'the shirt is white,' contradicts the information given in the premise. the woman's shirt is stated to be green in the premise. step 3: since the hypothesis contradicts the premise, it cannot be logically inferred from the given information."
2196,More than a dozen times in a504(a) Congress made the decision that certain activities could not be funded at all without crippling the LSC program with political pressures.,"To correct this, Congress is currently looking at the LSC program funding model.",1,1,True,"step 1: in the premise, it is stated that congress has made the decision more than a dozen times to prevent certain activities from being funded due to the potential harm it could cause to the lsc program. this suggests a history of political pressures affecting the lsc program funding. step 2: the hypothesis indicates that congress is currently addressing this issue by looking at the lsc program funding model. this action could be seen as a response to the identified problem of political pressures adversely affecting the lsc program funding. step 3: based on the logical connection between the premise and hypothesis, it can be inferred that the hypothesis is a reasonable response to the identified problem in the premise. this inference is supported by the information provided in the premise and the common-sense understanding that when there are recurring issues with a program, efforts are often made to address and correct the underlying causes.step 4: the hypothesis does not contradict the premise. in fact, it could be seen as a result of the identified problem in the premise.therefore, the hypothesis can be logically inferred from the premise."
2197,"Nestling at the foot of its ruined castle, the pretty medieval town of Kaysersberg is widely known as the birthplace of Nobel Peace Prize winner Albert Schweitzer (1875 1965).","Above the flourishing castle was Kaysersberg, where no one of import was born.",0,0,True,"step 1: in the premise, kaysersberg is described as a medieval town at the foot of a ruined castle, known as the birthplace of albert schweitzer. the castle is not described as being above the town, but rather the town is described as being at the foot of the castle. this location description does not contradict the fact that albert schweitzer was born there. step 2: the hypothesis states that 'above the flourishing castle was kaysersberg' which is not consistent with the information in the premise. the premise states that kaysersberg is at the foot of the castle. step 3: based on the logical reasoning, the hypothesis is not entailed by the premise as the descriptions of the location of kaysersberg in the two sentences are inconsistent."
2199,Jon's defense began to weaken and slow.,Jon felt stronger and more defensive than ever. ,0,0,True,"step 1: the premise describes a situation where jon's defense is weakening and slowing down, which can be interpreted as a decrease in his ability to defend himself. this does not necessarily provide any information about jon's feelings or emotions. step 2: the hypothesis suggests the opposite situation, that jon felt stronger and more defensive than ever. these two statements are contradictory, as they cannot both be true at the same time based on the given information. step 3: given that the hypothesis contradicts the premise, it cannot be logically inferred from the premise."
2200,and maybe we'll get to talk again okay bye-bye,Goodbye and good riddance.,0,0,True,"step 1: in the premise, the speaker is expressing a farewell and the possibility of future communication. this is a common expression used in various contexts, such as ending a conversation or leaving a place. no specific information about the relationship between the speaker and the person being addressed is given. the hypothesis is also a farewell statement.step 2: the hypothesis is not logically entailed by the premise. while both statements express farewells, they differ in tone. 'goodbye and good riddance' is a more negative and dismissive farewell, which is not suggested or implied in the premise.step 3: based on the logical analysis and the lack of common ground between the two statements, the hypothesis cannot be inferred from the premise."
2201,"Conservatives have attacked ENDA in several ways--by claiming, for example, that it entails job quotas (i.e.",Conservatives support the ENDA and believe they are a positive association.,0,0,True,"step 1: in the premise, it is stated that conservatives have attacked enda in various ways, specifically by making a claim about enda entailing job quotas. this indicates that conservatives have expressed opposition to enda based on this belief. step 2: the hypothesis, on the other hand, suggests a direct opposite to this relationship. it proposes that conservatives support enda. this contradicts the premise, as the premise states that conservatives have actively worked against enda, not in its favor. step 3: based on the logical inconsistency between the premise and hypothesis, it can be concluded that the hypothesis is not entailed by the premise."
2202,From Styles Court.,Styles Court was the return address.,1,1,True,"step 1: the premise 'from styles court' is indicating a location. a return address is a piece of information that specifies the sender's address in a mailing system. in this context, 'from styles court' is likely the sender's address. step 2: the hypothesis 'styles court was the return address' is identical to the premise. the hypothesis is logically equivalent to the premise, and therefore it can be inferred from the premise. step 3: based on the logical equivalence of the premise and hypothesis, the hypothesis is entailed by the premise."
2203,"Do you think I ought to go away from here at once?""",Should I go?,1,1,True,"step 1: analyzing the premise, 'do you think i ought to go away from here at once?' is a question asking for advice or an opinion about the necessity of leaving a certain location immediately.step 2: the hypothesis, 'should i go?' is a simpler and more direct form of the premise, expressing the same question or request for advice. the hypothesis is a logical and grammatically correct way of rephrasing the premise, not contradicting it in any way.step 3: based on the logical relationship between the premise and hypothesis, the hypothesis is entailed by the premise as they both represent the same request or question."
2204,"No, hear me!""  He lifted his hand in a brief gesture and Hanson felt a thickness over his lips that made speech impossible.",There was something covering his mouth.,1,1,True,"step 1: the premise describes a situation where the speaker tries to speak but is unable to due to a physical obstruction. the description of 'a thickness over his lips' is consistent with something covering the mouth. common sense and logical reasoning suggest that this 'thickness' is likely a physical object or material.step 2: the hypothesis 'there was something covering his mouth' can be logically inferred from the premise since the premise itself indicates the presence and cause of the object covering the mouth. the hypothesis is a more specific description of the situation presented in the premise.step 3: based on the logical connections between the premise and hypothesis, the common sense understanding of the situation, and the factual consistency of the given information, the hypothesis can be inferred from the premise."
2206,The Long-Term Budget Outlook.,Short term budget outlook. ,0,0,True,"step 1. in the premise, 'the long-term budget outlook' is mentioned, but no specific details or information about the contents of this outlook are provided. the term 'budget outlook' generally refers to an assessment or forecast of future financial conditions or trends. step 2. the hypothesis, 'short term budget outlook', is also a reference to a financial forecast, but it specifies that the focus is on a shorter time frame than the premise's 'long-term budget outlook'. step 3. based on the given information, the hypothesis does not logically follow from the premise. while both refer to budget outlooks, there is no necessary connection between a long-term outlook and a short-term one. the premise does not provide any indication that the short-term outlook is implied or entailed within the long-term outlook.step 4. it is important to note that the premise and hypothesis can still be related, as a short-term outlook is typically a component of a long-term outlook. however, the hypothesis itself is not logically inferred from the premise.step 5. in summary, the hypothesis 'short term budget outlook' is not logically entailed by the premise 'the long-term budget outlook'."
2207,"In both performance measurement and human capital development, practices used by the federal CIOs differed from those of CIOs in leading organizations, though federal CIOs were actively trying to address the issues.",Federal CIOs are much more efficient than other CIOs.,1,0,False,"step 1. the premise states that federal cios have different practices in performance measurement and human capital development compared to leading organizations. it also mentions that federal cios are actively trying to address these differences. however, the premise does not provide any information about the efficiency of federal cios compared to others.step 2. the hypothesis directly contradicts the premise by asserting that federal cios are 'much more efficient' than other cios, but the premise does not provide any evidence or indications of superior efficiency for federal cios.step 3. based on the information provided, the hypothesis cannot be logically inferred from the premise. the premise only mentions differences in practices and efforts to address them, it does not provide any evidence or indications of superior efficiency.label: 0"
2208,It is home to a major university as well as an arts and crafts college.,The major university was founded earlier than the arts and crafts college.,1,0,False,"step 1: in the premise, we have a description of a location that hosts both a major university and an arts and crafts college. no specific information is given about the founding dates of these institutions. step 2: the hypothesis suggests that the major university was established before the arts and crafts college. it is important to note that neither the premise nor the hypothesis make any logical contradictions or inconsistencies. step 3: while we cannot definitively infer the hypothesis from the premise because there is no direct information about the founding dates provided, it is not unreasonable to assume that one institution could have been established before the other. this is a common occurrence in real life, with older universities sometimes having been founded before the establishment of arts and crafts colleges or other specialized institutions. therefore, even though the hypothesis cannot be logically deduced from the premise, it is a plausible assumption based on real-world knowledge and common sense."
2209,"Nope, caught sight of them ridin' in.","No, didn't see them at all.",0,0,True,"step 1: in the premise, 'i caught sight of them ridin'' indicates that the speaker saw something or someone. however, the identity of the 'them' is not explicitly stated. the hypothesis, 'i didn't see them at all', contradicts the premise. step 2: the hypothesis cannot be logically inferred from the premise because the hypothesis states the opposite of what is stated in the premise. step 3: based on the given information, the hypothesis is not entailed by the premise."
2210,of course we kind of concentrate on there wasn't much to take out of the country i felt like we're going in and taken all their um their gold or oil or bananas or coffee or anything like that because uh it just,I felt bad about it.,1,0,False,"step 1: in the premise, the speaker describes the lack of valuable resources taken from a country during a visit, and expresses a feeling of guilt or unease about the situation. the hypothesis states that the speaker felt bad about something. while there's no direct connection between the actions mentioned in the premise and the feeling expressed in the hypothesis, it's important to note that feeling bad isn't necessarily a logical consequence of not taking valuable resources. it could be related to various reasons like moral, ethical, or empathetic considerations.step 2: the hypothesis is not logically entailed by the premise, as there's no clear causal relationship between the actions described and the feeling expressed. the hypothesis might be true, but it cannot be deduced directly from the premise.step 3: based on the given information, the hypothesis is not entailed by the premise."
2211,Backside view of a South America street vendor tending to her upright oven with a second woman looking away.,Backside view of a South America street vendor tending to her car.,0,0,True,"step 1: in the premise, we have a south america street vendor tending to an upright oven with another woman looking away. this implies a scene of a vendor working in a street setting, which is common in south america. there's no mention of a car in the premise.step 2: the hypothesis suggests a different scenario, with the same south america street vendor tending to a car instead of an oven. this contradicts the information given in the premise, as there is no indication of a car in the scene described.step 3: based on the logical analysis, the hypothesis is not entailed by the premise, as it presents a contradictory situation."
2212,"Superstition in this day and age!""  He swung to face Dave, whose vocal cords were still taut with the shock of the sight of the knife.",Dave was afraid of the knife.,1,1,True,"step 1: in the premise, the speaker expresses surprise about superstition in the present context. this context is not directly related to the presence or absence of a logical relationship between the premise and hypothesis. however, the second sentence in the premise describes dave's reaction to the sight of a knife, which is a typical reaction of fear.step 2: the hypothesis 'dave was afraid of the knife' is directly entailed by the premise as we can logically infer that the shock and fear described in the second sentence of the premise are a result of dave being afraid of the knife.step 3: based on the logical relationship between the premise and hypothesis and the common sense understanding of human reactions to potential threats, the hypothesis can be inferred from the premise."
2213,"The summary rating levels include achieved results, minimally satisfactory, and unsatisfactory.",The rating level of exceptional was reserved for the best performances.,0,0,True,"step 1: in the premise, three rating levels are mentioned - achieved results, minimally satisfactory, and unsatisfactory. there is no explicit mention of an 'exceptional' rating level, but the absence of such a mention does not necessarily mean that it does not exist. it is common sense and typical in many contexts for 'exceptional' to be used to denote the highest level of performance.step 2: the hypothesis suggests that 'exceptional' is used to denote the best performances. this is a reasonable inference given the common sense understanding of the term 'exceptional' and the lack of information to the contrary in the premise.step 3: based on the logical reasoning, common sense understanding of the term 'exceptional', and the lack of contradictory information in the premise, the hypothesis can be inferred from the premise.step 4: however, it is important to note that the premise itself does not entail the hypothesis directly. the hypothesis is a reasonable inference that can be drawn from the information in the premise, but it is not a logically necessary conclusion."
2214,Their sea-resistant limestone foundations stand on massive pinewood stilts driven 8 m (26 ft) into the lagoon bed.,The foundation was created with concrete.,0,0,True,"step 1: in the premise, it is mentioned that the foundation is made of limestone and is built on pinewood stilts. the method of construction or the material used for the foundation itself is not explicitly stated. however, the fact that the foundation is built on stilts indicates that it is a raised structure designed to withstand water. common sense and knowledge about construction techniques do not suggest that concrete would be used for a raised foundation in a lagoon or waterbody because concrete is not waterproof and would not be effective in this context. instead, materials like limestone or concrete blocks with waterproofing treatment are typically used for such structures. step 2: the hypothesis 'the foundation was created with concrete' contradicts the premise as it suggests the opposite of what the premise states. step 3: based on the information identified in the premise and the logical principle that the hypothesis contradicts the premise, the hypothesis cannot be logically inferred from the premise."
2215,"I suppose that there are people who feel happiness or sorrow or jealousy or triumph directly, without any combination of words, either remembered or made up for the purpose.",Human beings don't have feelings.,0,0,True,"step 1: in the premise, it is stated that there are people who experience feelings directly, without the need for language. this implies that feelings are a fundamental aspect of human experience. step 2: the hypothesis, 'human beings don't have feelings,' contradicts the premise. the premise assumes that feelings exist in people, while the hypothesis denies this. step 3: based on the logical negation of the premise, the hypothesis cannot be logically inferred from the premise."
2217,This is one of the subtlest issues in the book.,This book is not subtle for the most part. ,1,0,False,"step 1: the premise indicates that the 'subtlest issues' in the book are complex and nuanced. this implies that the book contains intricate and delicate points that require careful consideration. step 2: the hypothesis, on the other hand, states that the book is not subtle for the most part, suggesting that the book is relatively straightforward and easy to understand. these two statements appear to contradict each other. step 3: however, it's important to consider context. the term 'subtle' can have different meanings. in the premise, it refers to the complexity of the issues. in the hypothesis, it might be used to describe the clarity or simplicity of the book's writing. thus, the hypothesis doesn't necessarily contradict the premise if we interpret 'subtle' differently in each context. however, without more information, it's not clear that the hypothesis can be logically inferred from the premise. step 4: in conclusion, based on the information provided, it's not possible to definitively determine if the hypothesis is entailed by the premise or not. the context and meaning of 'subtle' as used in the hypothesis might differ significantly from the premise, making a definitive answer uncertain."
2218,"Four hundred of Cumberland's troops died in an epidemic of yellow fever and dysentery, and the British had to withdraw less than three months after their victory.",The troops lacked any sort of medicine to treat yellow fever.,1,1,True,"step 1: in the premise, it is stated that an epidemic of yellow fever and dysentery resulted in the death of 400 troops and the british withdrawal. this implies that the troops were afflicted by these diseases and could not effectively counter them. step 2: the hypothesis suggests that the troops 'lacked any sort of medicine to treat yellow fever'. this is a reasonable inference based on the information in the premise, as the fact that the disease(s) led to the death of 400 troops and the withdrawal of the british implies that they were unable to effectively treat or prevent the illnesses. step 3: based on the logical reasoning derived from the information in the premise and the common-sense understanding that a lack of medicine would make it difficult to treat and prevent the spread of diseases, the hypothesis is entailed by the premise."
2219,Privatization is not a solution.,Privatization can be replaced with communism.,1,0,False,"step 1: in the premise, 'privatization is not a solution' implies that privatization does not effectively address a problem or need. it does not provide any information about communism or its relationship to privatization. step 2: the hypothesis 'privatization can be replaced with communism' suggests a different solution or approach to address the same problem or need. however, the premise does not entail or logically imply this hypothesis. step 3: although privatization and communism are two distinct economic systems, the premise does not provide enough information to logically infer the hypothesis. the premise only states that privatization is not a solution, which does not directly relate to communism. step 4: based on the given information, the hypothesis is not logically entailed by the premise."
2220,Simcere Pharmaceutical is a manufacturer and supplier of branded generic pharmaceuticals in the Chinese market.,Simcere Pharmaceutical Group or Simcere Pharmaceutical () is a manufacturer and supplier of branded generic pharmaceuticals in the Chinese market.,1,1,True,"step 1: in the premise, simcere pharmaceutical is identified as a manufacturer and supplier of branded generic pharmaceuticals in the chinese market. the company name 'simcere pharmaceutical' is explicitly stated. step 2: the hypothesis uses the same description of simcere pharmaceutical, rephrasing it slightly as 'simcere pharmaceutical group' or 'simcere pharmaceutical ()'. the variations 'group' and '()' do not change the essential meaning of the premise. step 3: based on the logical equivalence of the premise and hypothesis, the hypothesis can be inferred from the premise."
2221,"He put her through some searching tests, and exposed her loss of memory to be fraudulent; but she had taken a note of his methods and reproduced them on me.","She learned how to test if memory loss was genuine, and used it on me.",1,1,True,"step 1: the premise describes a situation where a man (he) exposed a woman's (her) fraudulent memory loss. the woman (she) then learned the methods used by the man and applied them to someone else (me). this implies that the woman gained knowledge about testing for genuine memory loss and used it maliciously.step 2: the hypothesis can be logically inferred from the premise since the premise establishes that the woman obtained and used the man's methods for testing memory loss. the hypothesis goes one step further by stating that she specifically used this knowledge on someone else, which aligns with the information in the premise.step 3: based on the logical connection between the premise and hypothesis, and the lack of contradictory information, the hypothesis can be inferred from the premise."
2222,Drew could not really name the emotion he felt.,"He knew that he was, once again, surrendering to anger.",0,0,True,"step 1: the premise indicates that drew had difficulty identifying the emotion he was feeling. it does not provide any information about the nature or cause of this emotion. step 2: the hypothesis suggests that drew was experiencing anger. this emotion is a common and well-known feeling that can be surrendered to, meaning acknowledging or giving in to it. step 3: although the premise does not directly state that drew was experiencing anger, it does not contradict this hypothesis either. it is possible that drew was unable to name his emotion due to strong feelings of anger. based on this reasoning and the lack of contradictory information, the hypothesis 'he knew that he was, once again, surrendering to anger' can be inferred from the premise.step 4: it is important to note that while the hypothesis is a possible inference from the premise, it is not the only possible interpretation. the premise does not definitively determine that drew was feeling anger, and other emotions could also potentially explain his inability to name his feeling."
2223,"OSHA has estimated that in the first year there will be 1,300,000 respondents incurring total burden hours of 8,926,558, or an average burden per firm of 6.87 hours, at a cost of $180,787,295.","OSHA says the locations will only have 10,000 burden hours.",0,0,True,"step 1: osha's estimate of 1,300,000 respondents incurring a total of 8,926,558 burden hours translates to an average burden per firm of 6.87 hours. this is a clear statement of fact, stating the total hours and the number of firms. the hypothesis, on the other hand, provides a specific value for the total burden hours, without mentioning the number of respondents. step 2: the hypothesis directly contradicts the premise, as it asserts a significantly lower total burden hour value. step 3: based on the given information, the hypothesis cannot be logically inferred from the premise. the hypothesis is a clear contradiction of the facts presented in the premise."
2224,"And I'd be getting some fat residual payments, that great Writers Guild health insurance, and jeez, just the weekly paychecks would be terrific.",I would only receive the measly weekly paychecks and nothing else.,0,0,True,"step 1: in the premise, the speaker mentions several benefits they would be getting if they were a 'great writer', including fat residual payments, guild health insurance, and weekly paychecks. these benefits suggest a stable and financially rewarding career as a writer.step 2: the hypothesis states that the speaker would only receive the weekly paychecks and nothing else. this is a contradiction to the premise, as the premise indicates the receipt of additional benefits beyond just the weekly paychecks.step 3: based on the logical negation of the premise's information, the hypothesis cannot be inferred from the premise as it contradicts it."
2225,"The best Westchester novel of the past quarter-century, E.L.",None of the other Westchester novels are similar.,1,0,False,"step 1. in the premise, there is no explicit mention of any other westchester novels or their similarities or differences. the focus is on the best westchester novel of the past quarter-century, 'e.l'.step 2. the hypothesis states that 'none of the other westchester novels are similar.' this implies a comparison between 'e.l' and other westchester novels. however, the premise does not provide sufficient information to logically infer the hypothesis as it does not discuss the similarities or differences between 'e.l' and other westchester novels.step 3. based on the information provided, the hypothesis cannot be logically inferred from the premise."
2227,Testimony identified particular issues regarding agricultural workers who are permanent resident aliens and thus eligible for general representation.,There were no issues surrounding permanent resident aliens.,0,0,True,"step 1: in the premise, 'testimony identified particular issues' implies that there were issues reported regarding agricultural workers who are permanent resident aliens. 'eligible for general representation' further indicates that these are individuals with a specific legal status. step 2: the hypothesis 'there were no issues' directly contradicts the premise, as the premise states that issues were identified. step 3: based on the information provided, the hypothesis cannot be logically inferred from the premise, as the premise explicitly states that issues existed, while the hypothesis denies this fact."
2228,A woman in a pink shirt is painting the last two stars on a painting of the American flag.,The woman is sewing,0,0,True,"step 1. in the premise, a woman is described as painting the last two stars on an american flag. the activity of painting involves applying pigment to a surface with a brush. this action is clearly different from sewing, which involves joining two pieces of fabric together using a needle and thread.step 2. the hypothesis 'the woman is sewing' contradicts the information in the premise, as painting and sewing are distinct activities. inferring the hypothesis from the premise is not logically valid.step 3. based on the logical analysis, the hypothesis 'the woman is sewing' cannot be inferred from the premise 'a woman in a pink shirt is painting the last two stars on a painting of the american flag'."
2229,"Wal, sure, Kirby, Tobe Kells is a man o' his word.",Kirby is lying about Tobe.,1,0,False,"step 1: in the premise, it is stated that tobe kells is a man of his word, meaning that he keeps his promises and is trustworthy. step 2: the hypothesis, 'kirby is lying about tobe', suggests the opposite of what is stated in the premise. this implies that if the hypothesis were true, it would mean that tobe is not a man of his word. step 3: however, the premise and hypothesis contradict each other, as they present conflicting information about tobe's character. therefore, the hypothesis cannot be logically inferred from the premise."
2230,Product cream skimming is where a competitor tries to capture the most profitable portion of the market for a product with heterogeneous costs.,"Product cream skimming is pretty common, because it can yield quick and high returns.",1,1,True,"step 1: in the premise, 'product cream skimming' is defined as a competitive strategy where a company targets the most profitable portion of a market with heterogeneous costs. this strategy is a common business practice in markets where product differentiation exists and customers are willing to pay varying prices for different qualities or services.step 2: the hypothesis states that 'product cream skimming is pretty common' and that it 'can yield quick and high returns'. this statement can be logically inferred from the premise because the nature of product cream skimming itself implies the potential for quick and high returns. companies targeting the most profitable portion of a market are aiming to maximize their profits, which often results in quick returns. the common occurrence of this strategy is supported by the fact that it is a recognized business practice.step 3: based on the logical reasoning and the lack of contradictory information, the hypothesis can be inferred from the premise."
2231,"As black as it is, Heathers has the same theme as the Ringwald/Cusack movies.",Heathers was a wonderful dark comedy ,1,1,True,"step 1: in the premise, 'as black as it is' is a figurative expression meaning that heathers shares a great deal of similarity or themes with the ringwald/cusack movies. these movies are known for their dark comedic elements. step 2: the hypothesis states that heathers was a 'wonderful' dark comedy. this is consistent with the premise as it acknowledges that heathers shares the dark comedic themes with the ringwald/cusack movies. step 3: based on the logical connection between the premise and hypothesis, the hypothesis can be inferred from the premise. the premise sets up the expectation that heathers is a dark comedy, and the hypothesis confirms this."
2232,"a 1395ww(d)(4)(C), requires the Secretary to annually adjust the weights and classifications for the diagnosis related groups to which Medicare beneficiaries' hospital stays may be assigned.",The Secretary is never allowed to adjust weights and classifications.,0,0,True,"step 1: the premise indicates a legal requirement stating that the secretary must annually adjust the weights and classifications for medicare beneficiaries' hospital stays. this is a mandatory action. step 2: the hypothesis, on the other hand, states that the secretary is 'never allowed' to adjust weights and classifications. 'never allowed' is the opposite of 'required to'. therefore, the hypothesis contradicts the premise. step 3: based on the logical analysis, the hypothesis cannot be inferred from the premise as they are in direct contradiction."
2233,"In the succeeding months, these attorneys worked with representatives of the Greater Wenatchee Housing Authority, the state Office of Community Development, Chelan County, the City of East Wenatchee, state legislators, Jennings and others to secure funding and find a solution.","These attorneys, along with the departments and agencies they were working with, managed to find a good amount of funding.",1,1,True,"step 1: the premise describes a series of actions taken by these attorneys in collaboration with various departments, agencies, and individuals to secure funding and find a solution. it is a common occurrence for funding to be necessary and obtained in order to solve problems or address issues. step 2: the hypothesis proposes that a 'good amount' of funding was found. this is consistent with the actions described in the premise as they were working to secure funding. step 3: the premise implies that the efforts of these attorneys and their collaborators were successful in finding a solution, which in turn implies that they were able to secure a sufficient amount of funding to address the issue. therefore, the hypothesis is a logical inference from the premise."
2234,"The price in the restaurants on Tor Road is exorbitant, but you might like to try the beef either grilled straight or prepared Japanese-style as sashimi (raw), sukiyaki (thinly sliced and pan-fried), or shabu-shabu (stewed in a hot-pot broth).",You should try Japanese-styled sashimi or sukiyaki at least once.,1,1,True,"step 1: the premise describes the high prices at the restaurants on tor road and suggests trying the beef prepared in various japanese styles: sashimi, sukiyaki, or shabu-shabu. the premise does not provide any contradictory information or logical connections to the hypothesis. step 2: the hypothesis advises trying at least one of the japanese-styled dishes, sashimi or sukiyaki, based on the information provided in the premise. this suggestion is a reasonable inference, as the premise suggests that the japanese-styled dishes are available and the high prices might make trying multiple dishes impractical. step 3: given the information in the premise and the logical and common-sense reasoning, the hypothesis can be inferred from the premise."
2235,Time says Dolly the cloned sheep could be a fake.,Dolly is confirmed real sheep by Time.,0,0,True,"step 1: in the premise, time expresses a doubt about dolly being a real sheep due to potential fakery. this statement does not provide any direct information about dolly's confirmation as a real sheep.step 2: the hypothesis, on the other hand, asserts that dolly is a confirmed real sheep by time. however, the premise does not logically entail nor directly suggest this.step 3: based on the available information, the hypothesis is not entailed by the premise. the premise only expresses doubt, and the hypothesis makes a positive claim about confirmation. therefore, the hypothesis cannot be logically inferred from the premise."
2236,"Federer made six doubles finals during this time, but lost the Indian Wells Masters event in 2002.","Federer made six doubles finals during this time, but lost the Indian Wells Masters event in 2003.",0,0,True,"step 1: the premise states that federer made six doubles finals during a certain time period but lost in the indian wells masters event in the year 2002. this information does not specify whether federer participated in doubles or singles events during that time. the hypothesis also states that federer lost in the indian wells masters event but in the year 2003 instead of 2002.step 2: the hypothesis cannot be logically inferred from the premise because the premise does not provide enough information to support the hypothesis. the hypothesis contradicts the premise in the specific detail of the year of the lost event.step 3: based on the given information, the hypothesis is not entailed by the premise."
2237,"In the midst of the predominantly Germanic old city center, the Ceteau des Rohan, the classical 18th-century residence that was the home of Strasbourg's princes and cardinals, makes an emphatically French statement.",Ceteau des Rohan was among many other French buildings and no German ones.,0,0,True,"step 1: the premise describes the ceteau des rohan as a classical 18th-century residence that was the home of strasbourg's princes and cardinals, which is located in the old city center. it also mentions that the city center is predominantly germanic. however, the sentence 'makes an emphatically french statement' implies that the ceteau des rohan is distinctively french despite being in a germanic area. it's important to note that this statement does not necessarily mean that there are no german buildings nearby, but rather that the ceteau des rohan stands out as french.step 2: the hypothesis suggests that there were 'many other french buildings and no german ones' near the ceteau des rohan. this statement goes beyond the information provided in the premise and contradicts the known fact that the city center is predominantly germanic. it is not logically entailed by the premise as it makes additional assumptions about the absence of german buildings.step 3: based on the given information, the hypothesis cannot be logically inferred from the premise as it introduces new and contradictory information. the premise only states that the ceteau des rohan is a french building in a predominantly germanic area, it does not provide enough evidence to support the hypothesis that there were 'many other french buildings and no german ones'."
2238,Not suitable for young children.,Children are allowed to come if accompanied by a parent.,0,0,True,"step 1: the premise indicates that the content or environment is not suitable for young children. this doesn't necessarily mean that children are explicitly forbidden, but it suggests caution or age restrictions. step 2: the hypothesis states that children are allowed to come if accompanied by a parent. this is a different but related condition compared to an outright ban. step 3: the hypothesis can be inferred from the premise because it represents a restriction that still allows children to attend when specific conditions are met (accompanied by a parent). this restriction, while different, is consistent with the general caution or age restriction indicated by the premise. step 4: in this case, the hypothesis can be seen as a more specific or qualified version of the premise, rather than a contradiction or unrelated statement."
2239,"Numerous people sitting in a dim lit room talking, drinking coffee and using computers.",People are in a dimly lit room drinking coffee.,1,1,True,"step 1: in the premise, we have a description of a scene where numerous people are present in a dim lit room. they are engaged in activities such as talking, drinking coffee, and using computers. the description implies a setting where people are gathered for a purpose, possibly for a meeting or work.step 2: the hypothesis suggests a subset of the activities described in the premise. 'people are in a dimly lit room drinking coffee' is a logical implication of the premise, as the presence of people drinking coffee is explicitly stated in the premise. the hypothesis does not add any new information, but rather focuses on a specific aspect of the scene.step 3: based on the logical relationship between the premise and hypothesis, and the lack of any contradictory information, we can conclude that the hypothesis is logically entailed by the premise."
2240,Did Tripp have any input into the salary for her current position?,I do not care if Tripp had any input on her salary.  ,0,0,True,"step 1: in the premise, the question is asking about tripp's involvement in determining her salary. the premise does not provide any information about whether tripp had any influence on her salary or not. it only asks if she had any input. step 2: the hypothesis states that the speaker does not care whether tripp had any input on her salary or not. this statement is neither logically consistent nor contradictory with the premise, as the premise neither affirmatively states nor denies tripp's involvement in her salary. step 3: based on the information given, the hypothesis cannot be inferred from the premise as there is no logical connection between the two."
2241,"Yes, I have a wife and two sons.","Yes, I am divorced and don't have any kids.",0,0,True,"step 1: in the premise, the person is stated to have a wife and two sons. this information does not contradict each other, as having a wife and children can coexist. however, the premise does not provide any information about the person's marital status or the existence of any previous marriages. step 2: in the hypothesis, the person is described as being divorced and not having any kids. this directly contradicts the information in the premise since it states that the person does have a wife and two sons. step 3: based on the logical contradiction between the premise and hypothesis, the hypothesis cannot be inferred from the premise."
2242,"It is not a military rank, requires no duties, and carries with it no pay.","It is not a military rank, requires no duties, and carries with it no pay or other compensation.",1,1,True,"step 1: the premise states that something is not a military rank, requires no duties, and carries no pay. this description is identical to that in the hypothesis. no logical connections or contradictions are present between the two statements. step 2: the hypothesis can be logically inferred from the premise, as the hypothesis is a more specific version of the premise. the premise sets a minimum requirement, and the hypothesis meets and extends that requirement. step 3: since there is no contradiction between the two statements, and the hypothesis can be logically inferred from the premise, the hypothesis is entailed by the premise."
2243,Inside are leather-bound regimental books with each serviceperson's name duly inscribed.,There are books that tell how and when each person was killed.,1,0,False,"step 1: the premise describes a collection of leather-bound regimental books, each bearing the name of a serviceperson. this implies an organized record of individuals, likely containing information about their military service. step 2: the hypothesis suggests that there are books detailing how and when each person was killed. although not explicitly stated in the premise, it's possible for such records to exist, as they may be included in regimental books to commemorate the fallen or detail past military engagements. step 3: while the hypothesis cannot be definitively proven or disproven based on the given premise alone, it's not a contradiction and is plausible in the context of historical regimental records. the premise does not entail the hypothesis, but the hypothesis could be a possible expansion or addition to the information provided in the premise."
2244,"The stout-limbed can follow his example, and start by climbing the 300-odd stairs to the platform just below the steeple for a fine view over the city.",The platform is just a few steps away from the bottom.,0,0,True,"step 1: in the premise, it is stated that the stout-limbed can follow an example to climb the 300-odd stairs to reach a platform for a fine view over the city. this implies that the platform is located at the top of the stairs, and that climbing stairs is a necessary action to reach it.step 2: the hypothesis states that the platform is just a few steps away from the bottom. this directly contradicts the premise since the premise explicitly states that there are 300-odd stairs to climb to reach the platform.step 3: based on the logical reasoning, the hypothesis cannot be inferred from the premise as it contradicts the information provided in the premise."
2245,"The door is too thick.""",The door is thick enough to block out sound.,1,1,True,"step 1: in the premise, 'too thick' implies that the door has a thickness greater than what is required for effective sound insulation. however, having a thickness greater than the minimum required does not necessarily mean that the door is thick enough to block out sound completely. common sense and real-world experience show that thick doors can effectively insulate against sound. step 2: the hypothesis 'the door is thick enough to block out sound' can be inferred from the premise under the assumption that 'too thick' implies a thickness greater than the minimum required for effective sound insulation. in other words, if we assume that the speaker meant 'too thick for normal use' instead of 'too thick for sound insulation', then the hypothesis can be inferred. however, without additional context, it is impossible to be certain of the speaker's intent. step 3: based on the logical reasoning, common sense, and assumptions about the speaker's intent, the hypothesis can be inferred from the premise with some degree of certainty."
2246,James Mason and Orson Welles began their acting careers here.,Orson Welles never acted here.,0,0,True,"step 1: in the premise, it is stated that james mason and orson welles both started their acting careers at a specific location. this information does not necessarily imply that orson welles continued acting at this location throughout his career. it is a common occurrence for actors to start their careers in one place and then go on to work in various other locations. step 2: the hypothesis, 'orson welles never acted here', contradicts the premise, 'james mason and orson welles began their acting careers here'. if orson welles never acted at the specified location, then he did not begin his acting career there. step 3: based on the given information and logical principles, the hypothesis 'orson welles never acted here' cannot be logically inferred from the premise 'james mason and orson welles began their acting careers here'. the premise does not provide enough detail to entail the hypothesis."
2247,"I owe you something for the relentless way you've squashed me whenever I've tried to be sentimental."" Tuppence raised her face to his.",I don't appreciate that you wouldn't let me be sentimental.,0,1,False,"step 1. the premise implies a situation where tuppence feels that she has been prevented from expressing or acting sentimentally, and she feels that this has been done by the person addressed in a forceful or relentless manner. this implies that the person has not allowed tuppence to be sentimental, creating a contrast between tuppence's desire to be sentimental and the person's actions.step 2. the hypothesis states that tuppence doesn't appreciate the person's behavior because they wouldn't let her be sentimental. this hypothesis can be logically inferred from the premise, as the premise already indicates that tuppence's sentimentality has been suppressed and she feels negatively about this.step 3. based on the logical connection between the premise and hypothesis, common sense understanding of human emotions, and the lack of contradictory information, the hypothesis can be inferred from the premise."
2248,"Instead it congratulated the couple on the courage and optimism that had enabled them in the end to  You got home in time to see the film, so it really wasn't such a bad day.",The two people were recognized for their pessimistic thinking.,0,0,True,"step 1. in the premise, the text indicates that the two people had a bad day but managed to watch a film and find positivity in it, leading to congratulations from 'it'. this implies a turnaround from a negative situation to a more optimistic one. step 2. contrary to the hypothesis, the text does not suggest any recognition or praise for pessimistic thinking. in fact, the people were congratulated for their courage and optimism in turning a bad day around. step 3. based on the information in the premise and the logical negation of the hypothesis, it can be concluded that the hypothesis is not entailed by the premise."
2249,"Under its subsequent extensions, the President was authorized to negotiate agreements with other countries for tariff reduction.","Under this act and its subsequent extensions, the President was authorized to negotiate agreements with other countries for tariff reduction.",1,1,True,"step 1: the premise states that the president was authorized to negotiate tariff reduction agreements with other countries under subsequent extensions. this implies that there exists an act or legislation which was extended, allowing the president this authority. the hypothesis is identical to the premise, suggesting a direct logical relationship.step 2: the hypothesis, like the premise, indicates that the president was authorized to negotiate tariff reduction agreements with other countries under the given act and its extensions. there are no contradictory elements in the hypothesis, and it is consistent with the information provided in the premise.step 3: the hypothesis is a restatement of the premise, and therefore, it is logically entailed by the premise. the hypothesis is not only consistent with the premise but is the very same statement as the premise."
2250,Of our adventure! ,It was a great adventure.,1,1,True,"step 1: in the premise, the word 'adventure' is used with excitement and enthusiasm, indicating a positive and exciting experience. the absence of any negative information in the premise suggests that the adventure was enjoyable and successful. step 2: the hypothesis 'it was a great adventure' aligns with the information provided in the premise, as 'great' implies something positive and enjoyable. the hypothesis is not contradictory to the premise. step 3: the hypothesis can be reasonably inferred from the premise as the premise sets the stage for a great adventure, and the hypothesis affirms that outcome."
2251,"Title 31 defines an aagency- subject to GAOas authority very expansively, to mean a adepartment, agency, or instrumentality- of the United States government, but not the legislative branch or the Supreme Court.",Title 31 includes the Supreme Court in its definition of an agency.,0,0,True,"step 1: in the premise, title 31 is defined to include 'agencies, departments, or instrumentalities' of the united states government, excluding the legislative branch and the supreme court. this definition specifies what is meant by 'agency' in the context of title 31.step 2: in the hypothesis, it is stated that title 31 includes the supreme court in its definition of an agency. however, the premise directly states that the supreme court is excluded from the definition.step 3: based on the information provided, the hypothesis is not logically inferable from the premise. the premise explicitly states that the supreme court is not an agency as defined by title 31. therefore, the hypothesis contradicts the premise and cannot be inferred from it."
2252,"I was struck by this a decade or so ago when I was in Prague, then still under Communist rule, where I had been invited to give a few lectures to some Party institutes about technology.",I have given lectures on space travel and rocket fuel.,1,1,True,"step 1: in the premise, the speaker mentions that they were in prague a decade ago, which was still under communist rule, and they were invited to give lectures to some party institutes about technology. this information does not directly state the topics of the lectures, but it implies that they were related to a field of study or industry that was of interest to the communist regime.step 2: the hypothesis suggests that the lectures were specifically about space travel and rocket fuel. while the premise does not explicitly state this, it does not contradict it either. in fact, the information provided in the premise is consistent with the hypothesis, as technology related to space travel and rocket fuel would have been of significant interest to a communist regime with aspirations towards scientific and industrial advancement.step 3: based on the given information, the hypothesis can be reasonably inferred from the premise, as the premise implies that the lectures were related to a field of technology, and the hypothesis specifically identifies one such field. therefore, the hypothesis is a logical entailment of the premise."
2253,"He played college football at Arizona State University and attended Wilkinsburg High School in Wilkinsburg, Pennsylvania.","He played college football at Arizona State University and attended Auldhame High School in Auldhame, Pennsylvania.",0,0,True,"step 1. the premise provides two pieces of information about the subject: they attended wilkinsburg high school in wilkinsburg, pennsylvania, and played college football at arizona state university. there is no logical connection or contradiction between these pieces of information. step 2. the hypothesis also provides two pieces of information: the subject attended auldhame high school in auldhame, pennsylvania, and played college football at arizona state university. however, the hypothesis contradicts the premise regarding the high school attended by the subject. step 3. based on the information provided, the hypothesis cannot be logically inferred from the premise, as it contradicts a fact stated in the premise."
2254,A Seattle firefighter standing in front of his truck.,The firefighter is standing.,1,1,True,"step 1: in the premise, the firefighter is described as 'standing in front of his truck'. this indicates that the firefighter is currently in a position where he has both feet on the ground and his body upright. this is a common and reasonable interpretation of the term 'standing'.  step 2: the hypothesis, 'the firefighter is standing', is identical to the information provided in the premise. therefore, the hypothesis can be directly and trivially inferred from the premise. step 3: given that the hypothesis is an exact restatement of the premise, the hypothesis is entailed by the premise."
2255,Some pedestrians with multiple shopping bags walk down a paved walkway.,There are people walking down a walkway,1,1,True,"step 1: in the premise, 'some pedestrians with multiple shopping bags' are described, indicating there are people carrying shopping bags and moving around. a paved walkway is mentioned as the location where they are walking. step 2: the hypothesis 'there are people walking down a walkway' explicitly states that people are walking, which is exactly what the premise describes. the walkway is also mentioned in both sentences, making the hypothesis a logical consequence of the premise. step 3: based on the logical relationship between the premise and hypothesis, and the lack of contradictory information, the hypothesis can be inferred from the premise."
2256,"Maroon people are very private, still running their own affairs and paying no land taxes to the government.",Maroon people are in the wrong for not paying land taxes to the government.,1,0,False,"step 1: in the premise, it is stated that maroon people are private, managing their own affairs, and do not pay land taxes to the government. this information provides context about the maroon community and their way of living. step 2: the hypothesis asserts that maroon people are 'in the wrong' for not paying land taxes to the government. this statement implies a moral judgment about the maroon people and their actions. step 3: the premise and hypothesis appear to be in contradiction, as the premise describes the maroon people's actions as a part of their culture and way of life, while the hypothesis suggests that they are morally wrong for not paying land taxes. however, the premise itself does not provide any information about the moral rightness or wrongness of the maroon people's actions. common sense and logical principles do not allow for making moral judgments based on insufficient or irrelevant information. step 4: the hypothesis cannot be logically inferred from the premise, as there is no connection between the maroon people's privacy, self-management, and land tax payment and their moral rightness or wrongness. the premise only describes their actions and situation, while the hypothesis makes a moral assessment. therefore, the hypothesis is not entailed by the premise."
2257,"We will have Casual Fridays like all other good media companies, but that doesn't mean you should just slip back into your Office 97 jacket or that favorite Microsoft Bob T-shirt.",Casual fridays are not that casual.,1,1,True,"step 1: in the premise, it is stated that 'we will have casual fridays', indicating an informal dress code on fridays. however, the sentence also includes a caveat 'but that doesn't mean you should just slip back into your office 97 jacket or that favorite microsoft bob t-shirt'. this shows that there are certain expectations or guidelines for what is considered appropriate attire on casual fridays. step 2: the hypothesis 'casual fridays are not that casual' can be inferred from the premise since the premise itself acknowledges that there are limits to what can be worn on casual fridays. this is a logical inference, as the premise implies that there is a certain level of formality expected even on casual fridays. step 3: based on the logical reasoning and the explicit statement in the premise, the hypothesis 'casual fridays are not that casual' is entailed by the premise."
2258,Young children and parents splashing around a public fountain.,There are families eating lunch,0,0,True,"step 1: the premise describes a scene where young children and parents are splashing around in a public fountain. this scene does not inherently imply that families are eating lunch. however, it is a common occurrence for families to bring a picnic or have lunch near a public water feature such as a fountain. step 2: the hypothesis 'there are families eating lunch' could be a possible explanation for why the families might be present at the public fountain in the first place. if we assume that the scene described in the premise is taking place during a time when it is reasonable for families to be having lunch, then the hypothesis could be logically inferred from the premise. step 3: based on the given information, logical principles, and common-sense reasoning, the hypothesis 'there are families eating lunch' can be inferred from the premise, but it is not a guaranteed conclusion as there is no explicit mention of families eating in the premise."
2259,They still had another 10 years to go to complete the contract.,They only had one year left to fulfill the contract's terms.,0,0,True,"step 1: the premise states that 'they' had 'another 10 years' to complete the contract. this implies that the contract was not yet finished and had a remaining duration of 10 years. step 2: the hypothesis suggests that 'they' only had 'one year left' to complete the contract. this statement contradicts the information in the premise, as the remaining contract duration in the premise is 10 years, not one year. therefore, the hypothesis cannot be logically inferred from the premise. step 3: based on the logical analysis, the hypothesis is not entailed by the premise."
2260,A man and a girl sit inside a floating tube in the water.,Two people sit in a floating tube.,1,1,True,"step 1: in the premise, there are two individuals identified as a man and a girl. they are depicted as sitting inside a floating tube in the water. the hypothesis states that 'two people sit in a floating tube'. this hypothesis is consistent with the premise as it accurately describes the situation. step 2: the hypothesis can be inferred from the premise because the premise already establishes that 'two people' are present, and the hypothesis only makes a statement about these two people sitting inside a floating tube. step 3: based on the logical consistency between the premise and hypothesis, and the absence of contradictory information, the hypothesis is entailed by the premise."
2261,"For example, the engineers of the battalion exposed to sarin showed no higher illness rates than others.",Sarin clearly caused illness in the engineers who were exposed to it. ,0,0,True,"step 1: in the premise, it is stated that the engineers exposed to sarin did not show higher illness rates than others. this suggests that the presence of sarin did not lead to a statistically significant increase in illnesses among the engineers. step 2: the hypothesis, however, asserts that sarin caused illness in the engineers. this directly contradicts the information in the premise. step 3: in order for the hypothesis to be logically inferred from the premise, it would need to be the case that the engineers did in fact experience higher illness rates, but this contradicts the information provided. therefore, the hypothesis cannot be logically inferred from the premise. step 4: it's important to note that the absence of evidence is not evidence of absence, and it's possible that the study did not have sufficient power to detect a small increase in illness rates. however, based on the information provided in the premise, the hypothesis is not a logical conclusion."
2262,Mangrove swamps along the coast and squat nipa palms give rise to mangrove jungle.,"Mangrove jungle covers the entire coast, there are no swamps. ",0,0,True,"step 1: the premise describes a situation where mangrove swamps and nipa palms lead to the formation of a mangrove jungle. this implies that mangrove jungles are formed in areas with mangrove swamps and nipa palms. mangrove swamps are characterized by their unique ecosystem, which thrives in brackish water and has distinct flora and fauna. step 2: the hypothesis claims the opposite of what is stated in the premise, suggesting that mangrove jungles cover the entire coast without any mangrove swamps. this contradicts the premise, as mangrove jungles are described as arising from mangrove swamps. step 3: based on the contradiction between the premise and hypothesis, it is clear that the hypothesis cannot be logically inferred from the premise. the hypothesis goes against the information provided in the premise, making it incorrect."
2263,A little girl in a pink soccer outfit standing in front of a soccer net,A girl is in front of the soccer net.,1,1,True,"step 1: in the premise, a little girl is described as being in a pink soccer outfit and standing in front of a soccer net. this information implies that the girl is participating in a soccer activity. the hypothesis, 'a girl is in front of the soccer net', aligns with the key information in the premise and is logically consistent.step 2: the hypothesis can be inferred directly from the premise since the premise states that a girl is present at the soccer net, and the hypothesis also asserts the presence of a girl but does not add any additional information.step 3: based on the logical consistency and alignment of information, the hypothesis 'a girl is in front of the soccer net' can be inferred from the premise 'a little girl in a pink soccer outfit is standing in front of a soccer net'."
2264,"During the class, participants learn to apply unit cost principles to the products they produce as well as how process, activity, and individual cost elements, such as labor, materials, and overhead, are accumulated to become unit or product cost.",This class functions in the same manner as an economics class.,1,1,True,"step 1: in the premise, it is stated that participants learn about unit cost principles, cost accumulation (process, activity, individual), and cost elements (labor, materials, overhead). these concepts are fundamental to understanding economics and economic analysis. step 2: the hypothesis suggests that the class functions in the same manner as an economics class. given that the premise indicates learning about economics-related concepts, the hypothesis is not a contradiction. step 3: based on the identification of similarities in the concepts being taught and the nature of economics as a discipline, the hypothesis can be reasonably inferred from the premise as both involve the study of economic principles and concepts.step 4: it's important to note that while the hypothesis can be inferred from the premise, it doesn't necessarily mean that all aspects of an economics class are covered in the given premise. the hypothesis only suggests that the class shares the same general nature as an economics class, and the premise itself indicates that the class focuses specifically on unit cost principles and cost accumulation.therefore, the hypothesis 'this class functions in the same manner as an economics class' can be considered entailed by the premise, but it's essential to understand the scope of both statements."
2265,"Despite the success of LSC and its many contributions to access to justice for lowincome Americans, its achievements are overshadowed by the fact that so many in our society continue to suffer injustice and are unable to gain access to a lawyer for critical legal assistance.",The LSC did not even try to help with access to justice.,0,0,True,"step 1: in the premise, it is stated that lsc (legal services corporation) has had successes and contributions to access to justice for low-income americans, but these achievements are overshadowed by the fact that many in society continue to suffer injustice and cannot access a lawyer for critical legal assistance. this information indicates that while lsc has made some progress, there is still a significant need for legal assistance for a large portion of the population. step 2: the hypothesis suggests that lsc did not even try to help with access to justice. this contradicts the premise, as the premise acknowledges that lsc has made efforts to help with access to justice. step 3: based on the information provided, the hypothesis cannot be logically inferred from the premise as it contradicts the facts stated in the premise."
2266,"They stood before the firing squad on the Esplanade near where it crosses Frenchmen Street, named in their memory.",They didn't stand before the firing squad on the Esplanade.,0,0,True,"step 1: in the premise, 'they stood before the firing squad' indicates that certain individuals were present and in a specific location during an event. the location is described as 'on the esplanade near where it crosses frenchmen street, named in their memory'. step 2: the hypothesis suggests a contradictory situation, stating 'they didn't stand before the firing squad on the esplanade'. given the information in the premise, this hypothesis cannot be inferred as it directly contradicts the stated fact. step 3: based on the logical reasoning and the contradiction between the premise and hypothesis, the hypothesis is not entailed by the premise."
2267,It was a simple room.,The room was complicated.,0,0,True,"step 1: a 'simple room' is often described as having a lack of complexity or clutter, with minimal elements or features. no specific information is given in the premise about the room's size, layout, or contents that would contradict the hypothesis. step 2: the hypothesis 'the room was complicated' is the opposite of the premise. it is not logically inferred from the premise, as the premise does not provide enough information to support the conclusion of complexity. step 3: based on the given information, the hypothesis 'the room was complicated' is not entailed by the premise. the premise 'it was a simple room' does not exclude the possibility of a room having complexity, but it does not provide sufficient evidence to infer that complexity is present."
2268,"Through the Web site, a total of 1,634 associates donated nearly $200,000 to Legal Aid in 2002.","1,634 associates gave money to Legal Aid through their GoFundMe site.",1,0,False,"step 1: in the premise, we have a clear statement about associates donating money to legal aid through a web site, with a specific number of donors (1,634) and a total amount raised ($200,000) in 2002.step 2: the hypothesis suggests a different platform for the donations (gofundme site) without any specific information about the number of donors or the total amount raised. while it's possible for donations to be collected through multiple platforms, the hypothesis as it stands does not provide enough information to be logically inferred from the premise.step 3: based on the given information, the hypothesis is not entailed by the premise."
2269,"Saturday in Massachusetts, just off I-91, in a restaurant, in the men's room, on the red plastic screen that covers the urinal drain, were emblazoned these  Say No To Drugs.",The Say No To Drugs campaign was largely ineffective. ,1,0,False,"step 1. in the premise, it is mentioned that there is a 'say no to drugs' campaign being run in a men's room in a restaurant located in massachusetts, near i-91. this information does not provide any logical connection or implication regarding the effectiveness or ineffectiveness of the campaign. step 2. the hypothesis states that the campaign was largely ineffective. this is not a direct logical implication of the premise, as the premise provides no information about the success or failure of the campaign. step 3. based on the given information, there is no entailment from the premise to the hypothesis. the hypothesis goes beyond the information provided in the premise, making it an independent statement."
2270,"Once Greece, a NATO member, gets involved, the whole of Europe, bound by treaty, could follow.",If they did Europe would not be required to follow suit.,0,0,True,"step 1: in the premise, it is stated that once greece, a nato member, gets involved, europe, as a whole, could follow due to being bound by treaty. this suggests a causal relationship between greece's involvement and europe's potential response. step 2: in the hypothesis, it is suggested that even if greece gets involved, europe would not be required to follow suit. this contradicts the premise as it implies that europe's involvement or response is not determined by a treaty or an obligation. step 3: based on the logical analysis, the hypothesis cannot be inferred from the premise as it contradicts the causal relationship established in the premise."
2271,"The activities included in the Unified Agenda are, in general, those expected to have a regulatory action within the next 12 months, although agencies may include activities with an even longer time frame.",Some actions were implemented for being shorter than 12 months. ,1,0,False,"step 1: the premise states that the activities included in the unified agenda are generally those that are expected to have a regulatory action within the next 12 months, but it also acknowledges that agencies may include activities with a longer time frame. step 2: the hypothesis suggests that there are some activities that were implemented even though they were shorter than 12 months. the hypothesis does not contradict the premise, as the premise allows for the inclusion of activities with time frames shorter than 12 months. step 3: based on the information provided, it is possible for some activities to be implemented before the 12-month mark, and this scenario is not logically inconsistent with the premise. therefore, the hypothesis is not necessarily entailed by the premise, but it is compatible with it.step 4: the hypothesis does not logically follow from the premise, as the premise does not guarantee that all activities will be implemented within 12 months. however, the hypothesis can be a plausible explanation for certain cases within the broader context of the premise.in conclusion, the hypothesis is not logically entailed by the premise, but it is a reasonable assumption that can coexist with the information given in the premise."
2273,oh a native Texan,He's from Texas.,1,1,True,"step 1: in the premise, 'oh a native texan' is an expression used to identify someone as being born and raised in the state of texas. the hypothesis, 'he's from texas', is a statement that asserts the same fact.step 2: the hypothesis can be logically inferred from the premise because the premise provides the additional context that the person being referred to is a native texan, and the hypothesis simply states that this person is from texas.step 3: based on the logical reasoning and lack of contradictory information, the hypothesis is entailed by the premise."
2274,"Many legal-aid organizations have a strong mission but lack a long-term plan, said Pat Stankard, client services manager at Gardner, Carton &amp; Douglas and former treasurer of the LMA.",Pat Stankard has a background in accounting.,1,1,True,"step 1: in the premise, pat stankard is identified as a client services manager at gardner, carton & douglas and a former treasurer of the lma. these roles do not directly imply a background in accounting. however, being a former treasurer is a strong indicator that pat stankard had significant financial management responsibilities in her past. step 2: the hypothesis states that pat stankard has a background in accounting. this hypothesis is consistent with the information in the premise, as pat stankard's past role as a treasurer strongly suggests a background in accounting. step 3: based on the logical connection between being a former treasurer and having a background in accounting, the hypothesis can be inferred from the premise.step 4: the premise does not explicitly state that pat stankard has a background in accounting, but it does provide sufficient context that the hypothesis is a reasonable inference.label: 1"
2275,The H-2A workers' presence in the United States under the temporary worker visa entitled them to LSC eligibility.,A lot of the H-2A workers are not aware of their LSC eligibility.,1,0,False,"step 1: the premise establishes that h-2a workers are entitled to legal services corporation (lsc) eligibility due to their presence in the united states under the temporary worker visa. this premise does not provide any information about the workers' awareness or knowledge of their lsc eligibility.step 2: the hypothesis suggests that a significant number of h-2a workers might not be aware of their lsc eligibility. this does not directly follow from the premise, as awareness and entitlement are two separate concepts. it is possible for individuals to be unaware of their eligibility for various reasons, such as lack of information or communication, language barriers, or other practical challenges.step 3: based on the information provided, there is no logical entailment between the premise and hypothesis. while it is possible that some h-2a workers might not be aware of their lsc eligibility, this is not an inherent or guaranteed conclusion from the premise."

2280,"No, he waits until he has had a violent quarrel with her, of which the whole household is cognisant, and which naturally directs their suspicions upon him. ",He was clear and free from suspicion. ,0,0,True,"step 1: in the premise, it is stated that there is a violent quarrel between two individuals, which results in the whole household having suspicions directed towards the man mentioned. this implies that the man's behavior is not consistent with being 'clear and free from suspicion'. step 2: the hypothesis 'he was clear and free from suspicion' contradicts the information given in the premise, as the quarrel and the resulting suspicions indicate the opposite. step 3: therefore, the hypothesis cannot be logically inferred from the premise."
2281,"Designed for Louis XV as the church of Ste-Geneviave (1755), it was secularized during the Revolution to serve as a mausoleum.",It was designed during the 15th century.,0,0,True,"step 1: the premise describes a building, which was initially designed for louis xv as a church but was later secularized and used as a mausoleum during the revolution. step 2: the hypothesis proposes that the building was designed during the 15th century. this hypothesis is contradictory to the premise since the premise states that the building was designed for louis xv, who reigned during the 18th century. step 3: the hypothesis cannot be logically inferred from the premise as it contradicts the key information provided in the premise."

2292,The darned fool! he murmured.,That darn genius! ,0,0,True,"step 1. in the premise, the speaker is expressing frustration or disbelief with someone, indicated by the exclamation 'darned fool'. the hypothesis presents a contrasting assessment of the same person, as a genius.step 2. the hypothesis cannot be logically inferred from the premise because the premise does not provide any information about the person's intelligence or abilities. moreover, the speaker's emotional tone does not necessarily imply that the person's actions were foolish due to a lack of intelligence.step 3. based on the given information, the hypothesis is not entailed by the premise."
2293,He said this week that he had sent a letter to the White House spelling out his questions about the organization.,He was attempting to keep the White House from finding out about the organization.,0,1,False,"step 1: the premise states that a person sent a letter to the white house expressing questions about an organization. this action does not inherently imply an intention to hide the organization from the white house. however, common sense and contextual understanding suggest that sending such a letter with the intention of concealment is a possible implication.step 2: the hypothesis proposes that the person was attempting to keep the white house from finding out about the organization. this can be seen as a logical implication of the premise, given that sending a letter with the intention of concealment would indeed serve to prevent the white house from discovering the organization.step 3: based on the logical connections, common sense reasoning, and the lack of contradictory information, the hypothesis can be inferred from the premise."
2294,"An outstanding selection of sculpture from India and Southeast Asia spanning a period of 2,000 years is a perfect complement to the Western art.",There is currently only a small array of African sculptures from the 19th century.,0,0,True,"step 1: in the premise, an outstanding selection of sculpture from india and southeast asia is described, spanning a period of 2,000 years and being a perfect complement to western art. this implies that the sculptures from india and southeast asia add value and enhance the existing collection, which is predominantly western in nature.step 2: the hypothesis states that there is only a small array of african sculptures from the 19th century in the collection. while this information is not explicitly stated or implied in the premise, it does not contradict it. the premise only speaks to the presence and value of the indian and southeast asian sculptures, making no mention of the absence or quantity of sculptures from other regions.step 3: based on the given information, the hypothesis cannot be logically inferred from the premise as there is no direct connection or logical relationship between the two statements. the premise describes the existence and value of a certain type of sculpture within a collection, while the hypothesis states the existence and quantity of a different type of sculpture. the lack of a logical or factual connection between the two pieces of information means that the hypothesis is not entailed by the premise."
2295,The man laughed at Ca'daan but at least he didn't hit him.,Ca'daan had told a funny joke which sparred him.,1,1,True,"step 1: the premise describes a situation where a man laughed at ca'daan, but did not hit him. this implies that there was some form of interaction between the man and ca'daan that resulted in the man's laughter. it is a common occurrence for people to laugh at jokes or find something humorous, indicating that the man's laughter could have been a response to something amusing that ca'daan said.step 2: the hypothesis suggests that ca'daan told a funny joke which spared him from being hit. this explanation is consistent with the premise as it provides a plausible reason for the man's laughter that did not involve physical harm.step 3: based on the information provided, the hypothesis is a reasonable inference from the premise. the premise leaves open the possibility that there was a non-violent reason for the man's laughter, and the hypothesis offers a plausible explanation for this behavior."
2296,The architects were British but the artisans were Indian and adept at adding detail reminiscent of Rajput forts and Mughal palaces.,The Indian artisans utilized traditional techniques to try to subvert the British tyranny.,1,0,False,"step 1: in the premise, we have the information that the architects were british, and the artisans were indian and skilled in adding details reminiscent of rajput forts and mughal palaces. these architectural styles are significant to indian history and culture. step 2: the hypothesis suggests that the indian artisans used traditional techniques to subvert british tyranny. while the premise doesn't explicitly state this, it doesn't contradict it either. in historical contexts, using traditional techniques can be seen as a form of resistance or preserving one's cultural identity in the face of foreign influence or dominance. step 3: the hypothesis is not directly entailed by the premise as the premise does not provide enough information to prove or disprove the hypothesis. however, the hypothesis is not contradictory to the premise and is a plausible interpretation given the historical context.step 4: it's important to note that without further context, it is impossible to definitively prove or disprove the hypothesis. the hypothesis requires additional assumptions or information not present in the premise. however, the hypothesis is not logically inconsistent with the premise and is a reasonable assumption given the historical context."
2297,"On the northern side of the island, the 14th-century church of Sant Miquel affords a hilltop view of the distant sea.",The church of Sant Miquel sits low to the ground and offers no interesting views.,0,0,True,"step 1: in the premise, the church of sant miquel is described as being located on a hilltop on the northern side of the island. this implies that the church has a raised position and a view of the distant sea. step 2: the hypothesis contradicts the information provided in the premise, stating that the church sits low to the ground and offers no interesting views. step 3: the hypothesis is not logically entailed by the premise as it states a contradictory fact. the premise does not provide any information that could lead to the conclusion that the church sits low to the ground or lacks interesting views."
2298,"Eventually, his forced resignations from the Truman and Eisenhower administrations led Rockefeller to turn to elective office as the one way of establishing an independent base.","Eventually, his forced resignations from the Eisenhower and Truman administartions led Rockefeller to turn to alcoholism as one way of establishing peace.",0,0,True,"step 1: in the premise, it is stated that rockefeller's forced resignations from the truman and eisenhower administrations led him to turn to elective office as a means of establishing an independent base. this implies a sequence of events where rockefeller faced challenges to his position in the administrations, responded by seeking elective office, and successfully gained independence. step 2: the hypothesis suggests a different response from rockefeller to his resignations, turning to alcoholism as a way of establishing peace. there is no logical connection or evidence in the premise that supports this hypothesis. it contradicts the information given in the premise, as there is no indication that rockefeller turned to alcoholism during this time. step 3: based on the logical analysis and the contradiction with the premise, the hypothesis is not entailed by the premise."
2299,Up until that point lord mayors of London had walked to Westminster in the yearly pageant on Lord Mayor 's Day.,Up until that point lord mayors of London had ridden or walked to Westminster in the yearly pageant on Lord Mayor's Day.,1,1,True,"step 1: in the premise, it is stated that lord mayors of london had walked to westminster in the yearly pageant up until a certain point. this implies a tradition where the lord mayor would travel to westminster on foot for the pageant. step 2: the hypothesis suggests a modification of this tradition where lord mayors could have either walked or ridden to westminster. since the premise already mentions walking as an option, the hypothesis is not contradictory and can be seen as a generalization or expansion of the information in the premise. step 3: based on the given information and logical principles, the hypothesis can be reasonably inferred from the premise as it does not contradict the premise and provides a more inclusive description of the historical tradition."
2311,yeah you know Road and Track had a had some articles on and particularly with with backseat uh with some where kids were were sitting in the backseat with seat belts on and they were thrown forward into the front seat and there was enough stretching the combination of stretching the spine to uh paralyze i mean to serious injury even though they were they were still locked in the the forced to go so really if your sitting in the backseat,Road and Track primarily talks about the front seats.,0,0,True,"step 1: in the premise, road and track is discussed to have had articles about the safety of children in the backseat during car accidents. the articles describe incidents where children were thrown forward due to the force of the accident, resulting in serious injuries. the key information here is that road and track has published articles related to the safety of children in the backseat.step 2: the hypothesis states that road and track primarily talks about the front seats. this is a contradiction to the information in the premise, as the premise states that road and track has published articles about the safety of children in the backseat.step 3: based on the logical contradiction between the premise and hypothesis, and the clear information provided in the premise, it is safe to conclude that the hypothesis is not entailed by the premise."
2312,"The latter, an important grape-growing area, is also remarkable for its cliff-side caves, used by local fisherman for storage purposes.",There are no cliff-side caves there.,0,0,True,"step 1: in the premise, it is mentioned that the grape-growing area is 'remarkable for its cliff-side caves,' which implies the existence of these caves. the premise further states that these caves are used by local fishermen for storage. step 2: contradictorily, the hypothesis asserts that 'there are no cliff-side caves there.' this statement directly contradicts the information provided in the premise, making it impossible for the hypothesis to be logically inferred from the premise. step 3: based on the logical analysis, the hypothesis cannot be inferred from the premise, as it contradicts the factual information provided in the premise."
2314, Senate Committee on Appropriations House Committee on Appropriations Senate Committee on Governmental Affairs House Committee on Government Reform,The committee works on government reform at the state level.,1,0,False,"step 1: identify key information and relationships in the premise. the premise lists several house and senate committees. these committees are involved in 'appropriations' and 'governmental affairs'. no specific level (federal or state) is mentioned in the premise. step 2: analyze how the hypothesis relates to or contradicts the premise. the hypothesis asserts that the committees work on government reform at the 'state level'. step 3: evaluate if the hypothesis can be reasonably inferred from the premise. the premise does not provide sufficient information to logically infer the hypothesis. while it is possible for these committees to work on government reform at the state level, there is no direct evidence from the premise to support this conclusion."
2360,"He had made the stance his own now, not the strict stance of the duelmasters of the north but his own relaxed stance prepared for any attack that might come his way.","He always followed what the others did, especially those from the north.",0,0,True,"step 1: in the premise, the text states that the person had adapted his stance for duels to a more relaxed version, which is different from the strict stance of the duelmasters from the north. this implies that he has unique preferences and doesn't strictly follow the methods of others, particularly those from the north.step 2: the hypothesis suggests that he always follows what others do, with a particular focus on those from the north. this directly contradicts the premise, as it implies that he does not have the ability to adapt and make his own choices.step 3: based on the contradictory nature of the hypothesis with the premise, it is not entailed by the premise."
2389,"I will show yooooouuuuuu! Edward cried out deep inside his soul with a battle cry of a future victor, and his emotions manifested themselves physiologically through the dilation of his left pupil by 6 percent. and a very quiet, nasal 'oouuu'.",Edward cried that he would show the people where he had hid it.,1,1,True,"step 1: in the premise, edward's emotional outburst is described, leading to a physiological response of a 6% dilation of his left pupil and a quiet 'oouuu' sound. this response could be due to various reasons, such as anger, excitement, or anticipation. none of these interpretations contradict the hypothesis.step 2: the hypothesis states that edward cried 'that he would show the people where he had hid it'. this implies an announcement or declaration of a hidden item. edward's emotional outburst in the premise does not explicitly state that he made such a declaration, but it does not contradict it either. in the context of common sense and logical principles, an emotional outburst can be a precursor to making a declaration, especially when the emotion is related to a significant event or discovery.step 3: based on the lack of contradictory information, the logical connection between an emotional outburst and a declaration, and the contextual possibilities suggested by the premise, the hypothesis can be inferred from the premise."
2393,yeah oh yes a mobile home's a heck of a lot cheaper and well actually whenever we got ours we picked it up used you know three or four years used and uh,Mobile homes are cheaper because they are smaller and use less materials to build.,1,0,False,"step 1: in the premise, the speaker shares their personal experience of buying a used mobile home, which they mention was cheaper than other options. no specific information about the size or materials used in the construction of the mobile home is provided. however, the hypothesis suggests a reason for mobile homes being cheaper, which is their smaller size and lesser material usage.step 2: the hypothesis is not directly entailed by the premise, as the premise does not mention anything about the size or materials of the mobile home the speaker bought. however, the hypothesis is a plausible explanation for why mobile homes might be cheaper in general. it is a common-sense assumption that smaller structures require fewer materials to build, and this assumption aligns with the information given in the premise about the mobile home being cheaper.step 3: while the hypothesis cannot be logically inferred from the premise alone, it is a reasonable and plausible assumption based on common-sense understanding of construction costs and the information provided."
2404,"Conversely, the mailer could increase his volume if the discount and the associated service are offered.",The mailer could definitely decrease his volume is the discount associated with it are offered.,0,0,True,"step 1: the premise suggests that the mailer could increase his volume if certain conditions are met (discount and associated service are offered). this implies that under these conditions, the mailer's actions result in a greater volume of mail being sent. step 2: the hypothesis suggests the opposite outcome, i.e., the mailer could decrease his volume. however, the premise does not provide any indication that these conditions (discount and associated service) would lead to a decrease in volume. in fact, common sense and logical reasoning suggest that the conditions mentioned in the premise are more likely to result in an increase. step 3: based on the information provided in the premise and hypothesis, and the logical and common-sense reasoning, the hypothesis cannot be logically inferred from the premise as it contradicts the implied outcome from the premise.step 4: it is important to note that there might be other contextual information or specific conditions that could potentially make the hypothesis true. however, without additional context, the hypothesis cannot be logically inferred from the premise."
2420,"Finally, he suggested that the patient's level of distress could influence motivational level as much as the severity of a patient's alcohol problems.",He was wrong about what he said regarding patients.,1,0,False,"step 1: in the premise, the speaker suggests that both the level of distress and the severity of a patient's alcohol problems can influence motivational levels. this statement implies that there is a complex relationship between these factors. common sense and research in psychology support the idea that both factors can impact a person's motivation to change. there are no known facts that contradict the premise.step 2: the hypothesis, 'he was wrong about what he said regarding patients,' is not directly related to the premise. it makes a broader claim about the speaker's statement being incorrect, which is not necessarily true or false based on the given information.step 3: based on the information provided, the hypothesis cannot be logically inferred from the premise because it goes beyond the scope of the premise. the premise only states that the speaker suggested a complex relationship between distress and motivational level in relation to alcohol problems. the hypothesis makes a claim about the accuracy of the speaker's statement, which cannot be determined solely from the given information."
2487,but i uh what i did with my garden is i have a a two by six frame that's five by ten i have two of them sitting side by side,I added things to my garden.,1,0,False,"step 1: in the premise, the speaker describes having a two by six frame that is five by ten and having two of them sitting side by side. this information does not necessarily imply that the speaker added things to the garden, but it does not contradict it either. it is a common practice to add new elements to a garden, but the premise does not provide sufficient evidence to infer this specific action.step 2: the hypothesis 'i added things to my garden' is not logically inferred from the premise, as the premise does not explicitly state that the speaker added anything to the garden. while it is possible that the speaker did add things based on common sense and the context, the premise alone does not provide enough information to make that conclusion.step 3: based on the given information, the hypothesis 'i added things to my garden' is not entailed by the premise. the premise describes the existence and size of garden frames, but it does not imply the addition of new things to the garden."
2496,"I am as ready to fire a former Union soldier as I am a Confederate """,Don't test me because I am ready to fire anybody who crosses me.,1,1,True,"step 1: in the premise, the speaker compares their readiness to fire a union soldier with that of a confederate soldier. this comparison suggests that the speaker is prepared to take action against individuals who were once part of the union or confederate forces. it does not provide any direct information about their current motivations or behavior towards specific people.step 2: the hypothesis does not explicitly relate to union or confederate soldiers, but rather asserts that the speaker is 'ready to fire anybody who crosses me.' this statement can be seen as a broader implication of the premise, as it suggests that the speaker is prepared to take action against anyone who poses a threat to them.step 3: based on the given information, the hypothesis can be seen as a reasonable inference from the premise. the comparison in the premise implies that the speaker has a history of taking action against soldiers, which could suggest a willingness to do so against others. the hypothesis extends this inference to any individual who opposes or 'crosses' the speaker, and does not contradict the premise.step 4: in conclusion, the hypothesis can be inferred from the premise based on the logical connection between the readiness to fire soldiers in the past and the willingness to fire anyone who poses a threat."
2509,Yes they were.,No they were not.,0,0,True,"step 1: the premise 'yes they were' is a affirmative statement with no specific information about who 'they' are or what action 'were' refers to. it provides no context or relationships that can be used to infer the hypothesis. step 2: the hypothesis 'no they were not' is a negation of the premise. a negation cannot be logically inferred from an affirmative statement without additional context or information. step 3: based on the absence of context or relationships between the premise and hypothesis, the hypothesis cannot be inferred from the premise."
2532,"Law schools have a real obligation to be extremely specific about what kinds of debt burdens students are going to have, and to discourage borrowing whenever possible.",Law schools should encourage borrowing in every circumstance.,0,0,True,"step 1: in the premise, law schools are advised to be specific about the debt burdens students might face and to discourage borrowing whenever possible. this implies that law schools have a responsibility to provide clear information about the financial implications of attending law school and to help students avoid unnecessary debt. step 2: the hypothesis suggests the exact opposite - that law schools should encourage borrowing in every circumstance. encouraging borrowing goes against the advice given in the premise as students might end up accumulating more debt than they can afford. step 3: based on the logical contradiction between the premise and hypothesis, the hypothesis cannot be inferred from the premise."
2552,"The relationship it describes may strike many as exploitative or ugly for other reasons, but it is not illegal.",The relationship is morally questionable.,1,0,False,"step 1: in the premise, it is stated that the relationship is not illegal. this means that the actions involved in the relationship do not violate any laws. however, it does not provide any information about the ethical or moral implications of the relationship. step 2: the hypothesis asserts that the relationship is morally questionable. this implies that the relationship involves actions or behaviors that are not generally considered to be moral or ethical. step 3: while the premise does not necessarily contradict the hypothesis, it also does not provide any support for it. the fact that a relationship is not illegal does not automatically make it moral or ethical. common sense and ethical principles would suggest that there can be many types of relationships that are not illegal but are still morally questionable. step 4: in conclusion, the hypothesis cannot be logically inferred from the premise as the premise does not provide enough information to support the hypothesis."
2585,and everything huh,There is nothing.,0,0,True,"step 1: in the premise, the phrase 'and everything' is ambiguous and lacks clear meaning, making it difficult to identify key information or relationships. the hypothesis 'there is nothing' presents a complete contradiction to the existence of 'everything' in the premise.step 2: the hypothesis cannot be logically inferred from the premise as they contradict each other. the hypothesis suggests a state of non-existence, while the premise describes a state with 'everything' present.step 3: based on the logical reasoning, lack of clear information in the premise, and the contradictory nature of the hypothesis, the hypothesis is not entailed by the premise."
2595,"From the Quai des Belges, you can take a cruise out to the Ceteau d'If, the island prison that was the scene of Alexandre Dumas's Count of Monte Cristo.",It is possible to take a helicopter ride to the Ceteau d'If.,1,0,False,"step 1: in the premise, it is mentioned that you can take a cruise from quai des belges to the ceteau d'if. this indicates that ceteau d'if is accessible by boat. no information is given about other means of transportation to the island. step 2: the hypothesis suggests that it is possible to take a helicopter ride to ceteau d'if. however, the premise does not entail or suggest that helicopters can be used to reach the island. step 3: based on the given information, the hypothesis cannot be logically inferred from the premise as there is no mention of helicopters in the premise."
2603,"In green surroundings, the buildings of the saltworks are set in a semicircle around administrative offices, each with easy access to the other and all in simple classical style.",The saltworks are a confusing maze of modern-style buildings.,0,0,True,"step 1: in the premise, the buildings of the saltworks are described as being in a semicircle around administrative offices, all in simple classical style and with easy access to each other. this implies an orderly and organized arrangement of the buildings. step 2: the hypothesis describes the saltworks as a confusing maze of modern-style buildings. this contradicts the information in the premise, which describes the buildings as being in a simple classical style and arranged in a logical semicircle. step 3: based on the logical contradiction between the premise and hypothesis, it can be concluded that the hypothesis is not entailed by the premise."
2626,"Northeast of the bridge, past the Fondaco dei Tedeschi post office, seek out the little 15th-century church of Santa Maria dei Miracoli.",The Santa Maria dei Miracoli church is south of the bridge.,0,0,True,"step 1: in the premise, the location of the santa maria dei miracoli church is described as 'northeast of the bridge, past the fondaco dei tedeschi post office'. this information provides a specific spatial relationship between the church and the bridge.step 2: the hypothesis states that 'the santa maria dei miracoli church is south of the bridge'. this statement contradicts the spatial relationship described in the premise, as northeast is in opposition to south.step 3: based on the logical analysis, the hypothesis cannot be inferred from the premise as they contradict each other."
2644,"In my Crossfire days, I was patronized even by Sam Donaldson.",I had many many fans during my Crossfire days.,1,0,False,"step 1: in the premise, the speaker mentions that sam donaldson, a well-known journalist, patronized them during their time on crossfire. patronization implies a condescending or dismissive attitude, and it does not provide any direct evidence of a large fan base. common sense suggests that having fans and being patronized by someone are two distinct things.step 2: the hypothesis, stating that the speaker had 'many many fans' during their crossfire days, is not logically inferred from the premise. having fans and being patronized are unrelated concepts.step 3: based on the given information, the hypothesis is not entailed by the premise. the premise does not provide enough evidence to support the hypothesis."
2666,oh man oh that's awful,Oh man that is pretty neat.,0,0,True,"step 1: both sentences express an exclamation using the phrase 'oh man'. however, the meaning and tone of each sentence are quite different. the premise expresses a negative emotion, while the hypothesis expresses a positive emotion. step 2: the hypothesis cannot be logically inferred from the premise, as there is no relation between 'that's awful' and 'that is pretty neat'. these sentences express different emotional responses to the same or similar situations. step 3: based on the lack of logical connection and the significant difference in meaning and tone, the hypothesis is not entailed by the premise."
2669,just in the ability to handle and then i have uh a three eighty six FX a sixteen bit machine,Ability to handle is irrelevant because I don't even have a machine.,0,0,True,"step 1: the premise is about having a specific machine (386fx, a sixteen-bit machine) and the ability to handle it. step 2: the hypothesis states that the ability to handle is irrelevant because the speaker does not have a machine at all. the hypothesis directly contradicts the premise as it mentions 'ability to handle' which is explicitly present in the premise. step 3: given the contradiction between the premise and hypothesis, it's clear that the hypothesis cannot be logically inferred from the premise."
2682,"Look here, what's the idea of telling my Dad we were feeding animals?  ",Why did someone tell my Dad we were planting trees?,0,0,True,"step 1. the premise suggests that someone told a lie about feeding animals to the speaker's dad. this implies an intention to hide or misrepresent the true activity. the hypothesis presents a different activity - planting trees - that could also be a reason for someone to deceive the father. the premise and hypothesis seem unrelated as they describe different actions.step 2. there is no direct logical relationship between the premise and hypothesis. the hypothesis does not entail the premise and vice versa. the fact that someone might lie about feeding animals does not necessarily mean they would lie about planting trees, and the reverse is also true.step 3. based on the given information, the hypothesis cannot be logically inferred from the premise."
2683,A old woman is holding shopping bags on a busy city street.,A woman with her groceries on the moon,0,0,True,"step 1. in the premise, an old woman is holding shopping bags on a busy city street. this suggests a scenario of an old woman shopping and carrying her purchases. this is a common and reasonable activity for an old woman. the location, a busy city street, is also consistent with this scenario.step 2. the hypothesis, 'a woman with her groceries on the moon', is a significant departure from the premise. there is no information in the premise that indicates the location is the moon or that the woman is carrying her groceries there. in fact, the premise explicitly states that the woman and her shopping bags are on a city street.step 3. based on the logical analysis, the hypothesis cannot be inferred from the premise as there is no supporting evidence or logical connection between the two statements."
2684,What we mean--and should mean--by character needs to be disentangled.,The character is very complex.,1,1,True,"step 1: in the premise, the author emphasizes the importance of understanding the true meaning of 'character'. this does not limit or contradict the possibility of a character being complex. in fact, a complex character can be a part of a well-defined character. step 2: the hypothesis that 'the character is very complex' does not contradict the premise, as a complex character falls under the category of a well-defined character. step 3: based on logical reasoning and the lack of contradiction, the hypothesis can be inferred from the premise.step 4: it is also worth noting that in common usage, a complex character often implies a well-defined one due to the richness and depth of their traits and motivations. therefore, the hypothesis is not only logically but also commonsensically inferred from the premise."
2691,"No matter what I ended up doing, I think I would have found some way within that profession to do public work, because that's what I was taught, Zelon said. ",Zelon does not care about public work and learned that from their father.,0,0,True,"step 1: in the premise, zelon expresses a belief that they would have engaged in public work, regardless of the specific role they ended up with in their profession. this suggests a strong affinity or value towards public work. step 2: the hypothesis, however, states that zelon did not care about public work and learned this from their father. this contradicts the information in the premise, as it suggests that zelon's interest or motivation for public work stems from their father instead of being an inherent value for zelon. step 3: based on the given information, the hypothesis is not entailed by the premise. in fact, the hypothesis contradicts the premise."
2692,There is a friendly atmosphere and staff are helpful.,There is a grungy atmosphere and grumpy staff.,0,0,True,"step 1: in the premise, a friendly atmosphere and helpful staff are described. this suggests a positive and welcoming environment. step 2: in contrast, the hypothesis describes a grungy atmosphere and grumpy staff. grungy refers to an unclean, dirty, or untidy environment, which contradicts the friendly and welcoming atmosphere described in the premise. grumpy staff are also in contrast with the helpful staff mentioned in the premise. step 3: the hypothesis cannot be logically inferred from the premise as it contradicts key aspects of the premise."
2700,A man without a shirt walking towards a gas station.,A shirtless man is entering a Wendy's.,0,0,True,"step 1: in the premise, a man without a shirt is identified as walking towards a gas station. there is no information provided about his actions or intentions inside the gas station. step 2: the hypothesis suggests that the same man, who is shirtless, is entering a wendy's instead of the gas station. however, without any additional context or information, it is not logically possible to infer this from the premise. there is no connection between the man being shirtless and entering a wendy's. step 3: based on the given information, the hypothesis is not entailed by the premise."
2708,"Men like Leon Battista Alberti, brilliant architect-mathematician-poet, brought about a new spirit of inquiry and scepticism.",A stupid individual brought a new type of questioning.,0,0,True,"step 1: in the premise, leon battista alberti is described as a brilliant architect-mathematician-poet who brought about a new spirit of inquiry and scepticism. this implies that alberti was an intelligent and questioning individual. step 2: the hypothesis, 'a stupid individual brought a new type of questioning,' contradicts the information in the premise. a stupid individual is the opposite of a brilliant and questioning person. step 3: based on the logical reasoning and factual inconsistency between the premise and hypothesis, the hypothesis is not entailed by the premise."
2739,"Begun by Delhi's first sultan, Qutb-ud-din, and completed by his son-in-law Iltutmish, the 73-m (240-ft) tower was erected to celebrate the Turkish conquest of Delhi.","Begun by the first sultan of Delhi, the tower was never finished.",0,0,True,"step 1: the premise states that the qutb minar tower was begun by delhi's first sultan, qutb-ud-din, and completed by his son-in-law iltutmish. this implies a process of construction that started and ended. step 2: the hypothesis proposes a contrasting scenario where the tower was begun but never finished. while both scenarios involve the beginning of the tower's construction, they differ in their conclusion - the premise suggests completion, while the hypothesis suggests incompletion. step 3: to determine if the hypothesis can be logically inferred from the premise, we need to evaluate if the information in the hypothesis can be derived from the premise. the premise does not provide sufficient evidence to infer that the tower was never finished. it only states that it was started by one sultan and completed by another. the hypothesis introduces new information that is not explicitly stated in the premise. step 4: therefore, the hypothesis cannot be logically inferred from the premise as it contradicts the information provided in the premise about the completion of the tower."
2741,oh we do we do we do it we really do,We truly believe that there is need for more gun control.,1,0,False,"step 1: the premise consists of repetitive and vague statements about 'doing it' and 'really doing it,' which do not provide clear or specific information. it does not indicate any stance or belief regarding gun control. step 2: the hypothesis expresses a belief that there is a need for more gun control. this belief is not logically entailed by the premise, as the premise neither supports nor contradicts the hypothesis. step 3: based on the absence of logical connection or contradiction between the premise and hypothesis, the hypothesis cannot be inferred from the premise."
2766,The instinct that led me to insist on examining those coffeecups. ,I didn't really think I needed to check out those coffee cups.,0,0,True,"step 1: in the premise, 'instinct' refers to an unconscious yet inherent drive or tendency, while 'insist on examining' implies a strong desire or compulsion to act. the hypothesis states 'i didn't really think i needed to check out those coffee cups,' which implies a lack of need or desire to perform the action. these statements do not directly contradict each other, but there seems to be a discrepancy between the premise's indications of a strong urge to examine and the hypothesis's suggestion of a lack of need.step 2: the hypothesis does not follow logically from the premise because the premise describes an instinctual behavior without specifying whether the action was based on a conscious thought or not. the hypothesis contradicts the premise if we assume that having an instinct implies a conscious need or thought to act on it. however, it is also possible to interpret the premise as referring to an unconscious or reflexive behavior that is not necessarily based on a thought or need. in this case, the hypothesis is not directly contradictory.step 3: based on the given information, the hypothesis cannot be definitively determined to be either entailed or contradictory to the premise. both statements describe different aspects of the situation, and further context or clarification may be needed to determine their logical relationship."
2853,yeah i guess so yeah being told what to do is worse,It's much better to be told what to do.,0,0,True,"step 1: in the premise, the speaker expresses their opinion that being told what to do is worse. this statement implies a personal dislike or discomfort with being given instructions. step 2: the hypothesis presents an opposing view, stating that it's better to be told what to do. however, the premise and hypothesis contradict each other, as they express opposite opinions on the same topic. step 3: based on the logical analysis, the hypothesis cannot be logically inferred from the premise as they express contradictory statements.step 4: it's important to note that logic alone cannot determine which opinion is correct or more accurate, as it depends on personal preferences, values, and circumstances. the premise and hypothesis represent two different viewpoints, and neither can be considered the definitive answer."
2874,"The occasional cry of gulls and unexpected distant vistas will remind you that Dublin is by the sea, and the Wicklow mountains, which hold Dublin closely to the coast, are visible from everywhere.","Dublin has views of the sea, mountains, as well as the desert.",1,0,False,"step 1. in the premise, it is mentioned that dublin is by the sea and that the wicklow mountains, which are visible from everywhere in dublin, hold dublin closely to the coast. this information indicates that dublin is located near the sea and has a view of the mountains. step 2. the hypothesis, however, introduces a contradictory element by mentioning 'desert' in addition to the sea and mountains. there is no information in the premise suggesting a desert in dublin or in its vicinity. step 3. based on the given information, the hypothesis cannot be logically inferred from the premise as it contradicts the fact stated in the premise about dublin being near the sea and having views of the mountains."
2912,Regulation (FAR) The regulation that sets forth uniform policies and,FAR is a regulation that has no uniform policies.,0,0,True,"step 1: in the premise, 'far' is identified as a regulation that sets forth uniform policies. this means that far is a regulatory document that establishes consistent rules and guidelines for a particular domain. step 2: the hypothesis, on the other hand, states that far is a regulation that has 'no uniform policies'. this contradicts the information provided in the premise, as the existence of no uniform policies is not consistent with the definition of a regulation establishing 'uniform policies'. step 3: based on the logical inconsistency between the premise and hypothesis, it can be concluded that the hypothesis cannot be inferred from the premise."
2921,"(Pinker has denied the accusation, arguing that he is trying to understand infanticidal behavior, not condoning it.)",Pinker prohibited them from behaving like that ever again.,0,0,True,"step 1: in the premise, pinker is stated to have denied an accusation about condoning infanticidal behavior, explaining his actions as an attempt to understand it instead. this context does not provide any direct information about pinker prohibiting anyone from behaving in a certain way. however, there's no contradictory information provided in the premise that would prevent the hypothesis from being true.step 2: the hypothesis suggests that pinker took some action to prevent others from behaving in a certain way, but the premise does not provide enough information to definitively conclude whether this is the case or not. the hypothesis is not logically inferred from the premise, as it goes beyond the information provided.step 3: based on the given premise, the hypothesis cannot be logically inferred. it's an additional statement that might or might not be true, but the premise does not provide enough evidence to determine that."
2943,and Management of Scientific Studies in Natural,Natural science ,1,0,False,"step 1. the premise is about the process of scientific studies, including the formulation and management of hypotheses in the context of natural science. it does not specify a particular hypothesis or provide any details about its content or logical relationship to other concepts.step 2. the hypothesis provided is not given in the premise, so we cannot determine if it is logically entailed by the premise based on the information provided. the hypothesis 'natural science' does not follow logically from 'and management of scientific studies'.step 3. based on the given information, the hypothesis is not entailed by the premise."
2966,A group of 9 men and women walking upstairs.,The group is invading Mars.,0,0,True,"step 1: in the premise, we have a group of 9 men and women who are walking upstairs. this is a common, everyday scenario that does not suggest any unusual or extraordinary circumstances. the hypothesis, however, proposes an entirely different situation - invading mars. there is no information in the premise that even implies a connection to mars or any kind of invasion.step 2: the hypothesis 'the group is invading mars' cannot be logically inferred from the premise 'a group of 9 men and women walking upstairs' because there is no shared information or logical connection between the two statements. the premise describes an action taking place, while the hypothesis suggests a completely different situation.step 3: based on the given information, the hypothesis cannot be inferred from the premise as there is no logical connection or commonality between the two statements."
2974,"Based on availability of resources, particularly labor, it is projected that an additional 6,000 MWe of FGD capacity could be built for a total of 10,000 MWe by 2005.",This capacity level would meet demands for ten years.,1,0,False,"step 1: the premise states that an additional 6,000 mwe of fgd capacity could be built by 2005, reaching a total of 10,000 mwe. this indicates a significant increase in generating capacity. however, the premise does not provide specific information about current or projected power demands. step 2: the hypothesis assumes that the 10,000 mwe capacity level would meet demands for ten years, but there is no direct link between the capacity level and power demands in the premise or hypothesis. meeting demands for ten years depends on the actual demand levels and the efficiency of the power plants. step 3: based on the given information, the hypothesis cannot be logically inferred from the premise. while it's possible that the increased capacity could meet demands for ten years, there's no certainty or evidence to support that claim."
2988,"Missouri was asked to continue its planning efforts and file a supplemental planning report with LSC on or before October 1, 1999.",Missouri was happy to continue it's planning efforts. ,1,0,False,"step 1: in the premise, missouri is requested to continue its planning efforts and file a report with lsc by a certain date. this does not provide any information about missouri's emotions or attitudes towards the continuation of its planning efforts. step 2: the hypothesis suggests that missouri was 'happy' to continue its planning efforts, but there is no information in the premise that supports or contradicts this statement. emotions and attitudes are not directly mentioned or inferable from the premise. step 3: based on the given information, the hypothesis cannot be logically inferred from the premise."
2995,"However, assuming the procedural requirements of Chapter 36 are met, changes negotiated by the Postal Service and a mail user for their mutual benefit may merit recommendation under the applicable statutory standards.",Changes negotiated by the Postal Service are too regular and prohibit my postal services.,0,0,True,"step 1: in the premise, it is stated that changes negotiated by the postal service may merit recommendation under certain statutory standards, assuming the procedural requirements of chapter 36 are met. this implies that these changes are not necessarily detrimental and can be beneficial.step 2: the hypothesis suggests that the changes negotiated by the postal service are too regular and prohibit the individual's postal services. however, the premise makes no mention of the frequency or nature of these changes being detrimental or prohibitive.step 3: based on the given information, the hypothesis cannot be logically inferred from the premise, as the premise does not provide sufficient evidence to support the hypothesis.step 4: the hypothesis contradicts the premise, as the premise suggests that the changes can be beneficial under certain conditions, while the hypothesis suggests they are detrimental and prohibitive.therefore, the hypothesis is not entailed by the premise."
2998,Several children in full riding gear are on horseback in a grassy field carrying polo equipment.,The children are swinging on swings at the playground.,0,0,True,"step 1. the premise describes a scene where several children are on horseback in a grassy field with polo equipment. this implies that they are likely participating in an activity related to horses and polo. it is not common for children to wear full riding gear and carry polo equipment to swing on swings. the scene is also described as being in a grassy field, which is not a typical location for a playground with swings. step 2. the hypothesis is that 'the children are swinging on swings at the playground'. however, the information in the premise does not support this hypothesis. the horses and polo equipment mentioned in the premise contradict the hypothesis as swings are not typically associated with horses or polo equipment. step 3. based on the logical reasoning and factual inconsistency between the premise and hypothesis, the hypothesis is not entailed by the premise."
