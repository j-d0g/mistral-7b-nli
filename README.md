# Mistral-7b Fine-Tuning for NLI with Chain-of-Thought

This project focuses on fine-tuning the Mistral-7B language model for Natural Language Inference (NLI) tasks, specifically using Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning to improve classification performance and interpretability.

## Project Goal

The primary objective is to instruction-tune Mistral-7B using a custom NLI dataset augmented with CoT reasoning. The final model should accurately classify premise-hypothesis pairs as either entailment (1) or no-entailment (0), maximizing performance on a hidden test set.

## Data

The core data is organized as follows:

*   `data/original_data/`: Original NLI premise-hypothesis pairs with labels (train.csv, dev.csv, test.csv).
*   `data/original_thoughts/`: JSON Lines files containing examples augmented with Chain-of-Thought (`thought_process`) and the model's original `predicted_label`, generated using `scripts/generate_thoughts.py`.
*   `data/reflected_thoughts/`: Contains reflection data for examples where the model prediction was incorrect, generated using `scripts/generate_thoughts_reflected.py`.
*   `data/finetune/`: Prepared data for fine-tuning in the instruction format expected by the SFT trainer.
*   `data/sample/`: Contains small sample datasets (including demo.csv) for quick testing.

> **Note:** All scripts default to using sample data if no specific paths are provided. This prevents accidental overwriting of important data during testing.

### Downloading the Datasets

We provide a convenient script to download all the necessary datasets from Hugging Face:

```bash
# Method 1: Use Docker (recommended)
# First build the Docker image if you haven't already
docker build -t mistral-nli-ft .

# Download datasets through Docker
docker run --rm -v $(pwd):/app -w /app mistral-nli-ft python3 data/download_data.py

# Method 2: Set up a virtual environment (if not using Docker)
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
pip install requests tqdm python-dotenv
cd data
python3 download_data.py
```

The script will:
1. Download all necessary CSV and JSONL files from the specified HF repository
2. Organize them in the appropriate directories
3. Run the data preparation script to generate the fine-tuning datasets

For private repositories, add your HF token to a `.env` file or pass it directly with `--token YOUR_TOKEN`.

See `data/README.md` for more details on the dataset structure and formats.

## Optimized Inference

We've optimized the inference process to efficiently process the 1977-sample NLI test set:

### Optimization Techniques

1. **4-bit Quantization**: Using `bitsandbytes` for efficient memory usage. Specifically, it uses `nf4` (Normal Float 4-bit) quantization with double quantization enabled to further reduce memory footprint, allowing 7B models to run on consumer GPUs (like RTX 4090 with ~16GB VRAM usage) while maintaining reasonable accuracy.
2. **Batch Processing**: Optimized batch sizes (default 32 via `run_inference.sh`, configurable in `sample_model.py`) for maximizing throughput while managing memory.
3. **Sequence Length Reduction**: Reduced from potential 2048 â†’ 512 tokens based on analysis showing optimal CoT accuracy in the 250-400 token range, significantly reducing computational load (attention complexity scales quadratically) and memory requirements.
4. **Flash Attention 2**: Leverages Flash Attention if available for faster processing.
5. **Checkpoint System**: The underlying `sample_model.py` saves progress every batch and can resume from interruptions (though the wrapper runs it as one process).
6. **Consistent Prompting**: Uses the exact prompt format (`[INST]...[/INST]`) from fine-tuning for optimal results.
7. **Flexible Data Handling**: Automatically detects labeled vs. unlabeled datasets and adapts behavior (calculating accuracy if labels are present).
8. **Chain-of-Thought Support Rationale**: Incorporating CoT generation during inference improves accuracy on complex NLI examples and provides interpretable reasoning paths, allowing better analysis of the model's decision-making process.

### Performance Gains

* Initial runtime estimate: ~2hr42min with batch size 8
* Optimized runtime: ~50min with batch size 32 (>3x speedup)
* GPU Memory Usage: ~16GB/24GB VRAM with batch size 32 (efficient usage while maintaining performance).

### Performance Characteristics (Observed on RTX 4090)
- **GPU Memory**: ~16GB VRAM (4-bit quantized model with batch size 32)
- **CPU**: Moderate usage (tokenization, post-processing)
- **Disk**: ~15GB for base model cache, minimal for results/adapters
- **Processing Rate**: ~1-2 samples per second (dependent on batch size, exact model, CoT generation length)
- **Total Runtime (1977 samples)**: ~50 minutes (batch size 32), adjusts with batch size.
- **CoT Reasoning Impact**: Can be ~1.5-2x slower than direct classification depending on thought process length.

### Running Unified Inference

Our consolidated inference script (`evaluate/run_inference.sh`) handles all inference scenarios through a simple parameter system. The script automatically detects whether your dataset has labels and adjusts the output accordingly.

Example (basic usage from the repository root):
```bash
# Run with default parameters (demo dataset and default model)
./evaluate/run_inference.sh

# Run with a specific model and dataset
./evaluate/run_inference.sh --model models/mistral-thinking-abl0 --data data/original_data/test.csv

# Run with a specific checkpoint
./evaluate/run_inference.sh --model models/mistral-thinking-abl0/checkpoint-2000

# Use a specific GPU
./evaluate/run_inference.sh --gpu 1
```

This unified approach:
- Eliminates script duplication (formerly multiple test_*.sh scripts)
- Creates consistent, descriptively-named output files
- Uses the same implementation for all scenarios
- Provides better error handling and user feedback

### Troubleshooting

1.  **CUDA Out of Memory (OOM) Errors**: If you encounter errors like `torch.cuda.OutOfMemoryError`:
    *   **Solution**: The most likely cause is the batch size. While the default is 32, try running `evaluate/sample_model.py` directly with a smaller `--batch_size` (e.g., 16, 8, or even 4). You cannot currently change the batch size via `run_inference.sh`. Refer to the "Advanced Usage" section in `evaluate/README.md` for direct script invocation examples.
2.  **Slow Inference**:
    *   Ensure Docker is correctly configured to use the NVIDIA GPU (`nvidia-docker` or equivalent setup). Check `nvidia-smi` inside the container.
    *   Ensure Flash Attention 2 is installed and usable (should be handled by the Dockerfile).
3.  **`FileNotFoundError`**:
    *   Double-check the paths provided to `--model` and `--data`. Ensure the model adapter files (`adapter_config.json`, `adapter_model.bin`, etc.) exist within the specified model directory.
4.  **Invalid Prediction Output / Low Accuracy**:
    *   Ensure the model path points to the correct fine-tuned adapters.
    *   Verify the input data format matches what the model was trained on.
    *   Confirm the prompt structure used in `evaluate/sample_model.py` aligns with the fine-tuning prompt.

### Output Files
The script saves results in the `results/` directory with automatically generated, descriptive filenames:

-   **JSON Output**: `results/[model_name]-[dataset_name]-[timestamp].json`
    -   Contains detailed configuration, overall metrics (if labels exist), timing, and per-sample predictions including the generated `thought_process` and `predicted_label`.
-   **CSV Output**: `results/[model_name]-[dataset_name]-[timestamp].csv`
    -   A flattened version containing the original premise/hypothesis, the true label (if available), and the model's `predicted_label`.

Where:
-   `[model_name]` is derived from the path provided via `--model`.
-   `[dataset_name]` is derived from the path provided via `--data`.
-   `[timestamp]` is the execution time.

## Training with Configurations

We've implemented a config-based training system inspired by Karpathy's NanoGPT approach:

```bash
# Run with the default configuration
./run_training.sh

# Use a specific configuration
./run_training.sh --config train/configs/ablation1.py

# Use ablation2 configuration on gpu 1
./run_training.sh --config train/configs/ablation2.py --gpu 1

# Override specific parameters
./run_training.sh --config train/configs/ablation1.py --batch_size 8 --no_wandb
```

### Benefits of the Configuration System:

* **Declarative Configuration**: Parameters defined in clean Python files instead of bash scripts
* **Intuitive Overrides**: Command-line parameters take precedence over config values
* **Reduced Duplication**: Default values exist in only one place
* **Self-Documenting Code**: Config files include comments and explanations
* **Simplified Experimentation**: Create new configurations by copying and editing files
* **Better Type Handling**: Proper typing of parameters (integers, floats, booleans)

### Understanding the Training System

The training system is composed of:

1. **run_training.sh**: A minimal Docker wrapper script that passes arguments to the Python code
2. **train/train_sft.py**: The main script that loads config and handles training
3. **train/config_loader.py**: A utility for loading Python configuration files
4. **train/configs/default.py**: Default configuration values for all training runs

This design separates infrastructure concerns (Docker, environment) from application logic (training parameters, model configuration).

## Methodology

### 1. CoT Data Generation (Completed)

*   The `scripts/generate_thoughts.py` script is used to query the Mistral API (`open-mistral-7b` model) for each example in train and dev CSV files.
*   The script prompts the model to produce a step-by-step reasoning (`thought_process`) and a final classification label (`predicted_label`) in JSON format.
*   It supports three prompt types: `initial_generation`, `scoring`, and `regeneration`.
*   Analysis scripts are used to verify data integrity, check for duplicates, and calculate baseline performance metrics of the original model's predictions.

### 2. Reflection on Incorrect Examples (Optional)

*   The `scripts/generate_thoughts_reflected.py` script is used to generate improved reasoning for examples where the model prediction was incorrect.
*   This separate script takes the original thought process JSON and identifies the incorrect examples, then asks a (potentially stronger) model to reflect on the errors and generate improved reasoning.
*   The output includes the original thought process, error analysis, and improved reasoning, all preserving the correct label.
*   Reflection results are saved in `data/reflected_thoughts/` directory.

### 3. SFT Data Preparation

*   The `scripts/prepare_ft_data.py` script creates a dataset by combining correct examples from original predictions with reflected examples for incorrect predictions.
*   The script inputs the original thoughts and the reflected thoughts, filters for correct examples from the original dataset, and combines them with all the reflected examples.
*   This approach ensures the highest quality training data: correct examples are reused as-is, while incorrect examples are replaced with their reflected, improved versions.
*   The `scripts/prepare_finetuning_data.py` is also available for more general data preparation options.
*   All outputs use Mistral-style instruction tags `...` to frame the task, with the target completion being the JSON string containing the `thought_process` and `predicted_label`.
    ```
    Premise: ...\nHypothesis: ...\n\n...instruction... 
    {"thought_process": "...", "predicted_label": ...} 
    ```

### 4. Fine-Tuning Strategy

We use QLoRA for parameter-efficient fine-tuning.

*   **Base Model:** `mistralai/Mistral-7B-v0.3` was selected due to its strong reasoning capabilities compared to other models in its size class, competitive performance observed in initial tests on sample NLI data, favorable inference speed and cost-effectiveness, and the availability of related models via API which supported the multi-stage CoT data generation process.
*   **QLoRA Config:** `r=32`, `lora_alpha=64`, dropout `0.05`, target modules `["q_proj", "k_proj", "v_proj", "o_proj"]`.
*   **Hyperparameters:** 3-5 epochs (with early stopping patience 3 based on eval loss), LR `2e-4` (linear decay, 3% warmup), AdamW optimizer (WD `0.01`), effective batch size 64, `bf16` precision.

#### Training Ablations:

1.  **Ablation 1 (Correct Only):** Train on examples where the original model's prediction was correct.
2.  **Ablation 2 (Reflected Thought Process - *Primary Goal*):**
    *   Incorporate thought process reflections for originally incorrect examples with a stronger model.
    *   Combine high-quality reflected examples with original correct examples.
    *   Implemented in `scripts/prepare_ft_data.py`.
3.  **Ablation 3 (Unmodified):** Train on all original examples, regardless of correctness.

### 5. Docker Setup

*   A `Dockerfile` is provided to build a container image with all necessary dependencies (PyTorch, CUDA, Transformers, PEFT, TRL, bitsandbytes, wandb, etc.).
*   Training and inference are executed within this Docker container on a remote workstation with GPUs.
    *   **Rationale**: Guarantees a consistent and reproducible environment across different systems, resolving complex dependency issues (CUDA, PyTorch versions). Simplifies setup and allows volume mounting for efficient model caching.
*   The `run_training.sh` and `run_inference.sh` scripts automatically handle mounting volumes, GPU selection, and running the Python code within the container.
*   `requirements.txt` lists the Python dependencies installed in the Docker image.

Before running training or inference, build the Docker image:
```bash
docker build -t mistral-nli-ft .
```

### 6. Evaluation

*   Primary evaluation metric is accuracy on the hidden test set.
*   During training, validation loss is monitored for early stopping and checkpointing.
*   Validation accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 can also be tracked if a `compute_metrics` function is added to `run_sft.py`.

### Evaluation Notes & Historical Context

This section provides context on model performance based on evaluations run during development, including addressing initial challenges.

**Performance after Fixing Extraction Logic:**

Initial evaluations were impacted by flawed logic for extracting the final prediction from model outputs containing Chain-of-Thought reasoning. After implementing a more robust extraction method (handling multiple JSONs, avoiding simple string checks), the performance comparison on the dev set was:

| Model                | Fixed Accuracy (Dev Set) | Notes                                      |
| -------------------- | ------------------------ | ------------------------------------------ |
| Base (Mistral-7B-v0.3) | ~53%                     | Original model without fine-tuning         |
| Fine-tuned (Ablation 2)| ~91%                     | Significant improvement (+38% vs Base)     |
| Checkpoint-1250      | ~82%                     | Early checkpoint showing good progress   |

*(Note: Final performance is measured on the hidden test set)*

**Key Historical Challenges Addressed:**

1.  **Extraction Bias:** The original extraction logic incorrectly interpreted outputs containing `\"step 1:\"` as predicting label 1, artificially deflating the apparent performance of CoT-generating models.
2.  **Multiple JSONs:** Fine-tuned models sometimes generated multiple JSON objects; the extraction logic needed refinement to correctly parse the intended one.
3.  **Training Tokenizer Config:** An early training issue where `tokenizer.pad_token` was set to `tokenizer.eos_token` potentially hindered the model's ability to learn proper output termination and also caused generation artifacts (like repetitive padding text) that interfered with reliable JSON extraction during evaluation. This was fixed in later training runs by adding a distinct `[PAD]` token and evaluation scripts were updated for robust parsing.

This context highlights the effectiveness of the fine-tuning process and the importance of robust evaluation procedures.

## Hugging Face Hub Repository

Fine-tuned model checkpoints from various ablation runs are available on the Hugging Face Hub:

[**jd0g/Mistral-v0.3-Thinking_NLI**](https://huggingface.co/jd0g/Mistral-v0.3-Thinking_NLI)

The Hub repository's README provides details on the available checkpoints and how to load them.

## Downloading Model Checkpoints

We provide convenient scripts to download the fine-tuned Mistral-7B NLI model from the Hugging Face repository:

1. **Using the download_model.py script (recommended)**:
   This script will download only the essential adapter files needed for inference from the Mistral_Thinking_Abl2 checkpoint.

   ```bash
   # Navigate to the project root
   cd /path/to/mistral-7b-nli
   
   # Create the models directory if it doesn't exist
   mkdir -p models
   
   # Run the download script
   python download_model.py
   ```
   
   The script will download the model files to `models/mistral_thinking_abl2/` directory.

2. **Using the Docker-based download_checkpoints.sh script**:
   For downloading the complete model with all checkpoints:

   > **Important Note**: The Hugging Face repository is **private** and requires authentication. You must have access to the repository and provide a valid Hugging Face token to download the model.

   ```bash
   # Set your Hugging Face token as an environment variable
   export HF_TOKEN=your_hugging_face_token_here

   # Download the model
   ./models/download_checkpoints.sh

   # Or provide the token directly
   ./models/download_checkpoints.sh --token your_hugging_face_token_here
   ```
