## Abstract

This paper describes our approach to fine-tuning the Mistral-7B language model for Natural Language Inference (NLI) tasks with Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning. The goal is to create a model that not only provides accurate classifications but also generates interpretable reasoning processes that explain its decisions.
